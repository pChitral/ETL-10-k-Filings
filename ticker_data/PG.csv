Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Management's Discussion and AnalysisForward-Looking StatementsCertain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including, without limitation, in the following sections: “Management's Discussion and Analysis” and “Risk Factors.” These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled ""Economic Conditions, Challenges and Risks"" and the section titled “Risk Factors” (Item 1A of this Form 10-K). Forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this report and we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise.The following Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended to provide the reader with an understanding of P&G's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. MD&A is organized in the following sections:•Overview•Summary of 2012 Results •Economic Conditions, Challenges and Risks•Results of Operations•Segment Results•Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity•Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates•Other Information Throughout MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), free cash flow and free cash flow productivity. Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain specified charges. Free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending. Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. We believe these measures provide investors with important information that is useful in understanding our business results and trends. The explanation at the end of MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures.Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category and are measured on an annual basis versus the prior 12 month period. References to competitive activity includes promotional and product initiatives from our competitors.OVERVIEWP&G is a global leader in retail goods focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, salons and in high-frequency stores. We continue to expand our presence in other channels, including department stores, perfumeries, pharmacies, salons and e-commerce. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 75 countries.Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate - often holding a leadership or significant market share position.13 The Procter & Gamble CompanyORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTUREOur organizational structure is comprised of Global Business Units (GBUs), Global Operations, Global Business Services (GBS) and Corporate Functions (CF).Global Business UnitsUnder U.S. GAAP, the business units comprising the GBUs are aggregated into five reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby Care and Family Care. The GBUs are responsible for developing overall brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovations and marketing plans. The following provides additional detail on our reportable segments, businesses and the key product and brand composition within each.Reportable Segment% ofNet Sales*% of NetEarnings*CategoriesBillion Dollar BrandsBeauty24%22%Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Cosmetics, Hair Care, Hair Color, Personal Cleansing, Prestige Products, Salon Professional, Skin CareHead & Shoulders, Olay, Pantene, SK-II, WellaGrooming10%16%Blades and Razors, Electronic Hair Removal Devices, Hair Care Appliances, Pre and Post Shave ProductsBraun, Fusion, Gillette, Mach3Health Care15%17%Feminine Care, Gastrointestinal, Incontinence, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care, Other Personal Health Care, Vitamins/Minerals/SupplementsAlways, Crest, Oral-B, VicksFabric Care and Home Care32%26%Bleach and Laundry Additives, Air Care, Batteries, Dish Care, Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Detergents, Pet Care, Professional, Surface CareAce, Ariel, Dawn, Downy, Duracell, Febreze, Gain, Iams, TideBaby Care and Family Care19%19%Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants, Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet PaperBounty, Charmin, Pampers* Percent of net sales and net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2012 (excluding results held in Corporate).Recent Developments: In May 2012, we completed the divestiture of our snacks business to The Kellogg Company. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of our snacks business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and from segment results for all periods presented. As a result of this change, the pet care business is now included in the Fabric Care and Home Care segment. Effective during the quarter ending December 31, 2011, we implemented a number of changes to our organization structure within the Beauty and Grooming Global Business Unit (GBU), which resulted in changes to the components of the Beauty reportable segment and the Grooming reportable segment. We now manage these businesses based on the nature of the product rather than the consumer of the product. As a result, female blades and razors transitioned from Beauty to Grooming, while male personal care products, such as Old Spice and Gillette, moved from Grooming to Beauty. The GBU and segment discussions in MD&A and the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been retrospectively revised to reflect the new organizational structure. Beauty: We are a global market leader in the beauty category. Most of the beauty markets in which we compete are highly fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. We compete in beauty, hair care and prestige. In beauty care, we offer a wide variety of products, ranging from deodorants to cosmetics to skin care, such as our Olay brand, which is the top facial skin care brand in the world with approximately 10% of the global market share. In hair care, we compete in both the retail and salon professional channels. We are the global market leader in the retail hair care market with over 20% of the global market share behind our Pantene and Head & Shoulders brands. In the prestige channel, we compete primarily with our prestige fragrances and the SK-II brand. We are one of the global market leaders in prestige fragrances, primarily behind our Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci and Hugo Boss fragrance brands.Grooming: We are the global market leader in the blades and razors market and in nearly all of the geographies in which we compete. Our global blades and razors market share is approximately 70%, primarily behind the Gillette franchise including Fusion and Mach3. Our electronic hair removal devices, such as electric razors and epilators, are sold under the Braun brand in a number of markets around the world where we compete against both global and regional competitors. We hold approximately 30% of the male shavers market and over 40% of the female epilators market.The Procter & Gamble Company 14 Health Care: We compete in oral care, feminine care and personal health. In oral care, there are several global competitors in the market, and we have the number two market share position with over 20% of the global market. We are the global market leader in the feminine care category with over 30% of the global market share. In personal health, we are the global market leader in nonprescription heartburn medications behind our Prilosec OTC brand and in respiratory treatments behind our Vicks brand. Certain of our sales outside the U.S in personal health are generated through the PGT Healthcare partnership. Fabric Care and Home Care: This segment is comprised of a variety of fabric care products, including laundry detergents, additives and fabric enhancers; home care products, including dishwashing liquids and detergents, surface cleaners and air fresheners; batteries; and pet care. In fabric care, we generally have the number one or number two share position in the markets in which we compete and are the global market leader, with over 25% of the global market share, primarily behind our Tide, Ariel and Downy brands. Our global home care market share is over 15% across the categories in which we compete. In batteries, we have over 25% of the global battery market share, behind our Duracell brand. In pet care, we compete in several markets in the premium pet care segment, with the Iams and Eukanuba brands. The vast majority of our pet care business is in North America, where we have approximately a 10% share of the market.Baby Care and Family Care: In baby care, we compete mainly in diapers and baby wipes, with approximately 35% of the global market share. We are the number one or number two baby care competitor in most of the key markets in which we compete, primarily behind Pampers, the Company's largest brand, with annual net sales of approximately $10 billion. Our family care business is predominantly a North American business comprised largely of the Bounty paper towel and Charmin toilet paper brands. U.S. market shares are over 40% for Bounty and over 25% for Charmin.Global OperationsGlobal Operations is comprised of our Market Development Organization (MDO), which is responsible for developing go-to-market plans at the local level. The MDO includes dedicated retail customer, trade channel and country-specific teams. It is organized along five geographic units: North America, Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa (CEEMEA), Latin America and Asia, which is comprised of Japan, Greater China and ASEAN/Australia/India/Korea (AAIK). Throughout MD&A, we reference business results in developing markets, which we define as the aggregate of CEEMEA, Latin America, AAIK and Greater China, and developed markets, which are comprised of North America, Western Europe and Japan. Global Business ServicesGBS provides technology, processes and standard data tools to enable the GBUs and the MDO to better understand the business and better serve consumers and customers. The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class solutions at a low cost and with minimal capital investment.Corporate FunctionsCF provides Company-level strategy and portfolio analysis, corporate accounting, treasury, external relations, governance, human resources and legal, as well as other centralized functional support.STRATEGIC FOCUSWe are focused on strategies that we believe are right for the long-term health of the Company with the objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. The Company's long-term financial targets are:•Grow organic sales 1% to 2% faster than the market grows in the categories and geographies in which we compete,•Deliver Core EPS growth of high single digits to low double digits, and•Generate free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater.In order to achieve these targets, we are prioritizing the strategies and resources that will make P&G more focused and fit to win over the near- and long-term.Strengthening our Core Business We are prioritizing resources on our biggest, most profitable businesses and on the innovations and developing markets that offer the greatest opportunity for growth.•Top 40 Businesses: We define our core business as the top 40 country/category combinations, 20 in Household Care and 20 in Beauty & Grooming, which generate the highest level of annual sales and profit.•Top 20 Innovations: Our 20 most important innovations offer significantly higher growth potential than the balance of the innovation portfolio. Therefore, the growth of the Company depends substantially on the success of our biggest innovations.•Top 10 Developing Markets: Maintaining the strong growth momentum we have established in developing markets is critical to delivering our near- and long-term growth objectives. We are focusing resources first on the markets that offer the greatest growth opportunity. We will assess the potential for further portfolio expansions beyond the top 10 developing markets based on the top- and bottom-line growth progress of the core business.15 The Procter & Gamble CompanyImproving Productivity and Creating a Cost Savings Culture We have taken significant steps to accelerate cost savings and create a more cost-focused culture within the Company, including a five-year, $10 billion cost savings initiative, which was announced in February 2012. The cost savings program is based on:•Reduction in overhead spending, with a target of approximately 5,700 non-manufacturing overhead positions by the end of fiscal year 2013.•Annual savings planned in cost of goods across raw materials, manufacturing and transportation and warehousing expenses.•Generating efficiencies to enable us to grow marketing costs at a slightly slower rate than sales growth while still increasing consumer reach and effectiveness, saving approximately $1 billion over the five year period. Strengthening our Upstream Innovation Program and Pipeline Innovation has always been - and continues to be - P&G's lifeblood. To consistently win with consumers around the world across price tiers and preferences, and to consistently win versus our best competitors, each P&G product category must have a full portfolio of innovation. The innovation portfolios must include a mix of commercial programs, incremental product improvements and discontinuous innovations. We have made the creation of more discontinuous innovation a top priority, dedicating R&D resources and funding to develop new innovations aimed at changing the game in existing product categories and creating new ones.

The impairment charges included $1.6 billion of before-tax non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges associated with the Appliances and Salon Professional businesses. The incremental restructuring charges totaled $721 million before tax, resulting from the Company's productivity and cost savings plan announced during the year. A 160-basis point decline in gross margin was driven primarily by higher commodity costs and negative mix, partially offset by price increases and manufacturing cost savings.◦Net earnings from discontinued operations increased $1.4 billion due to the gain on the sale of the snacks business.•Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 19% to $3.12.◦Diluted net earnings per share decreased 7% to $3.66, including earnings from discontinued operations of $0.54 per share.◦Core EPS decreased 1% to $3.85.•Cash flow from operating activities was $13.3 billion.◦Free cash flow was $9.3 billion.◦Free cash flow productivity was 85%.ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHALLENGES AND RISKSWe discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases The Procter & Gamble Company 16 and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are ""forward-looking statements"" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors in this 10-K.Ability to Achieve Business Plans. We are a consumer products company and rely on continued demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail trade customers. Our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation with respect to both products and operations, on the continued positive reputations of our brands and our ability to successfully maintain trademark protection. This means we must be able to obtain patents and trademarks, and respond to technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our success is also dependent on effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. Our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing sales and volume profitably, especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets (including developing markets) in which we have chosen to focus. There are high levels of competitive activity in the environments in which we operate. To address these challenges, we must respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives, trade terms and product initiatives. We must manage each of these factors, as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, in order to effectively compete and achieve our business plans. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of ongoing acquisition, divestiture and joint venture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against base business objectives. Daily conduct of our business also depends on our ability to maintain key information technology systems, including systems operated by third-party suppliers, and to maintain security over our data.Cost Pressures. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, labor costs, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects, sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions, as well as consistent productivity improvements. We also must manage our debt and currency exposure, especially in certain countries with currency exchange controls, such as Venezuela, China, and India. We need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier and sole manufacturing plant arrangements, and successfully manage any disruptions at Company manufacturing sites. We must implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including our outsourcing projects and those related to general overhead and workforce optimization. Successfully managing these changes, including identifying, developing and retaining key employees, is critical to our success.Global Economic Conditions. Demand for our products has a correlation to global macroeconomic factors. The current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic. Economic changes, terrorist activity, political unrest and natural disasters may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographic markets, due to terrorist and other hostile activities or natural disasters. We could also be negatively impacted by a global, regional or national economic crisis, including sovereign risk in the event of a deterioration in the credit worthiness of, or a default by local governments, resulting in a disruption of credit markets. Such events could negatively impact our ability to collect receipts due from governments, including refunds of value added taxes, create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions and/or negatively impact our overall liquidity.Regulatory Environment. Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and tax laws. Our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including product liability, patent, intellectual property, competition law matters and tax policy) and to resolve pending legal matters within current estimates may impact our results.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A), other non-operating items and income taxes. The primary factors driving year over year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives and geographic expansion, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as pricing actions (which can also indirectly impact volume), changes in product mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the United States. Most of our cost of products sold and SG&A expenses are to some extent variable in nature. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focus primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year over year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other 17 The Procter & Gamble Companycommodities), pricing impacts, product and geographic mix (for example, gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and to a lesser extent scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary drivers of SG&A are marketing-related costs and overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we do achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. Overhead costs are also variable in nature, but on a relative basis, less so than marketing costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth. Accordingly, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs. In February 2012, the Company announced a $10 billion productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overhead expenses. The plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes in order to help fund the Company's growth strategy. The Company expects to incur approximately $3.5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a four-year period as part of this plan. Net SalesFiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011Net sales increased 3% to $83.7 billion in 2012 on unit volume that was consistent with the prior year period. Difficult macroeconomic conditions have caused a slowdown in market growth, particularly in developed markets. In addition, we have initiated a number of price increases across each reportable segment, in large part to recover the rising cost of commodities and currency devaluations. These factors have negatively impacted volume growth in 2012, but the price increases have led to higher overall sales. Volume grew low single digits in Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, and Baby Care and Family Care. Fabric Care and Home Care volume decreased low single digits. Volume grew mid-single digits in developing regions and was down low single digits in developed regions. The impact of overall global market growth was partially offset by market share declines in certain categories. Price increases added 4% to net sales, driven by price increases across all business segments and regions, primarily to help offset commodity costs and devaluing currencies in certain developing markets. Mix reduced net sales by 1% due to unfavorable geographic mix across the Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, and Fabric Care and Home Care reportable segments and unfavorable product mix. Foreign exchange was neutral to net sales. Organic sales growth was 3% driven by price increases.Fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010Net sales increased 5% in 2011 to $81.1 billion on a 6% increase in unit volume. Volume grew behind market and share growth. Global market growth, in categories that we compete, grew 3% on a constant currency basis. Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and double digits in developing regions. All geographic regions contributed to volume growth, led by double-digit growth in Asia, high single-digit growth in Latin America and mid-single-digit growth in CEEMEA and Western Europe. All five of the business segments contributed to volume growth with high single-digit growth in the Baby Care and Family Care and Fabric Care and Home Care segments, mid-single-digit growth in the Beauty and Health Care segments, and a low single-digit growth in the Grooming segment. Organic volume, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, was up 5%. Mix reduced net sales by 2% due mainly to disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier products, both of which have lower than Company average selling prices, and declines in the premium-priced professional salon and prestige categories. Pricing added 1% to net sales behind price increases to offset higher commodity costs and foreign exchange. Foreign exchange was neutral to net sales. Organic sales were up 4%, led by high single-digit growth in the Baby Care and Family Care segment, as well as mid-single-digit growth across the Grooming and Health Care segments.

The reduction in gross margin was driven mainly by a 230-basis point impact from higher commodity and energy costs. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by 200 basis points from negative geographic and product mix and by 30 basis points from the impact of increased restructuring spending due to the productivity and cost savings plan. The negative mix resulted from disproportionate growth in developing regions, as developing regions have lower relative gross margins than developed regions. These impacts were partially offset by a 200-basis point impact from increased pricing and a 140-basis point impact from manufacturing cost savings.Total SG&A increased 3% to $26.4 billion in 2012, driven by higher marketing spending to support initiative activity and a $510 million increase in restructuring spending from our productivity and cost savings plan, partially offset by a reduction in competition law fines (see Item 3 of this Form 10-K and Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies), which were $303 million in the prior year compared to $75 million in the current year. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points to 31.5%, as reduced competition law fines and the impact of increased scale leverage on marketing and overhead costs from higher sales were partially offset by 60 basis points of incremental restructuring costs.We incurred impairment charges of $1.6 billion ($1.5 billion after tax) in 2012 related to the carrying values of goodwill in our Appliances and Salon Professional businesses and our Koleston Perfect and Wella indefinite lived intangible assets, which are part of our Salon Professional business. See Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details, including factors leading to the impairment charges. Since goodwill is included in Corporate for internal management and segment reporting, the goodwill impairment charges are included in the Corporate segment. The indefinite lived intangible asset impairments are also included in the Corporate segment for management and segment reporting. Fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010Gross margin contracted 140 basis points in 2011 to 50.9% of net sales. The reduction in gross margin was driven mainly by a 225-basis point increase in commodity and energy costs, along with negative product mix from disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier products. These impacts were partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and the favorable impact of volume scale leverage.Total SG&A increased 4% to $25.8 billion in 2011 behind higher marketing and overhead spending, which was partially offset by the impact of lower foreign currency exchange costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points to 31.8% due to a reduction in overhead and other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by increased marketing investments. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points due to additional marketing investments to support innovation and expansion plans. Overhead spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 50 basis points due to sales leverage, partially offset by added spending to support growth. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points mainly due to a decrease in Venezuela-related foreign currency exchange costs of $548 million (see further discussion below in ""Venezuela Currency Impacts""). Charges for competition law fines increased to $303 million versus the prior year charge of $283 million. Non-Operating ItemsFiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011Interest expense decreased 7% in 2012 to $769 million, due to lower interest rates on floating rate debt and a decrease in average debt outstanding. Other non-operating income, net primarily includes divestiture gains, interest and investment income. Other non-operating income decreased $71 million to $262 million in 2012 mainly behind the impact of minor brand divestitures. A divestiture gain from the sale of our PUR water filtration brand in the current year was less than the Zest and Infasil divestiture gains in the prior year.Fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010In 2011, interest expense decreased 12% to $831 million due primarily to a reduction in interest rates on floating rate debt partially offset by an increase in debt outstanding. Other non-operating income was a net benefit of $333 million in 2011 versus $82 million in 2010. This $251 million increase was primarily due to the impact of gains on divestitures in 2011 (Zest brand in North America and Infasil brand in Western Europe) and incremental costs in the 2010 associated with exercising the call option on an outstanding bond, partially offset by a gain due to the acquisition of MDVIP in 2010. Income TaxesFiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 510 basis points to 27.1% in 2012 primarily due to a 250-basis point impact from the non-deductibility of impairment charges in the current year period and the net impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions, which drove 250 basis points of the tax rate difference. The net benefit on the current year was $165 million, which netted to 130 basis points, versus 380 basis points of net benefits in the prior year.Fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010In 2011, the effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 500 basis points to 22.0%. This was primarily driven by net favorable discrete adjustments (primarily driven by favorable audit and litigation settlements for uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions relating to 19 The Procter & Gamble Companyprior periods), which drove 410 basis points of the effective tax rate difference. Net adjustments to tax balances for uncertain tax positions in a number of jurisdictions resulted in a benefit of approximately $535 million in 2011, including a $252 million benefit from the settlement of U.S. tax litigation primarily related to the valuation of technology donations. The 2011 tax rate also benefited from the geographic mix of current year sales and earnings, which drove a 50-basis point reduction as an increased proportion of earnings were generated in foreign markets with lower tax rates versus the United States.Net EarningsFiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011Net earnings from continuing operations decreased 20% to $9.3 billion in 2012 as an increase in net sales was more than offset by the impact of impairment charges, incremental restructuring charges and an increase in income taxes. Operating margin declined 320 basis points due primarily to a 190-basis point impact from goodwill and intangible impairment charges in our Appliances and Salon Professional businesses and an 85-basis point impact from incremental restructuring charges. The impact of higher commodity costs and negative product mix were largely offset by higher pricing, manufacturing cost savings and increased scale leverage. Net earnings from discontinued operations increased $1.4 billion in 2012 due to the gain on the divestiture of the snacks business. Diluted net earnings per share decreased 7% from the prior year to $3.66 in fiscal 2012 behind a decrease in net earnings from continuing operations, partially offset by an increase in net earnings from discontinued operations and a reduction in shares outstanding. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations in 2012 decreased 19% to $3.12. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations increased $0.46 due to the gain on the divestiture of the snacks business, partially offset by a decrease in the earnings of the snacks business prior to the divestiture. The reduction in the number of shares outstanding was driven by treasury share repurchases of $4.0 billion, which were made under our publicly announced share repurchase program.Core EPS in 2012 decreased 1% to $3.85. Core EPS represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding current-year impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, current year incremental restructuring charges due to the productivity and cost savings plan, charges in both 2012 and 2011 for European legal matters and a 2011 benefit from the settlement of U.S. tax litigation primarily related to the valuation of technology donations. Fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010In 2011, net earnings from continuing operations were $11.7 billion, an increase of 8% versus the prior year due mainly to net sales growth and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by operating margin contraction. Operating margin decreased 120 basis points due to a decrease in gross margin, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A spending as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin declined behind higher commodity costs, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales declined due to reduced foreign currency exchange costs and a reduction in overhead spending as a percentage of net sales due to productivity improvements, partially offset by increased marketing investments. In 2011, net earnings from discontinued operations decreased $1.8 billion mainly due to the impact of the gain on the divestiture of the global pharmaceuticals business in 2010. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations in 2011 increased 11% to $3.85 behind higher net earnings from continuing operations and the reduction in shares outstanding. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations declined $0.56. Diluted net earnings per share declined 4% to $3.93 driven by lower net earnings from discontinued operations, partially offset by higher net earnings from continuing operations and a reduction in weighted average shares outstanding resulting from share repurchase activity. The reduction in the number of shares outstanding was driven by treasury share repurchases of $7.0 billion, nearly all of which were made under our publicly announced share repurchase program. Core EPS increased 7% in 2011 to $3.87.Venezuela Currency ImpactsVenezuela was determined to be a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP during fiscal 2010 and as a result, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Venezuela. Currency remeasurement adjustments for non-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by these subsidiaries and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings. During fiscal 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued the Bolivar Fuerte relative to the U.S. dollar. The remeasurement of our local balance sheets in fiscal 2010 to the new official exchange rate (4.3 Bolivares Fuertes to the U.S. dollar) did not materially impact our results. This was due to the relatively small non-dollar denominated net monetary asset position in Venezuela. Our overall results in Venezuela are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements at the 4.3 rate, which is also expected to be applicable to dividend repatriations.Foreign currency transactions in Venezuela are subject to an official government currency exchange rate. Transactions at the official exchange rate are subject to CADIVI (Venezuela government's Foreign Exchange Administrative Commission). During recent years, in addition to the official exchange rate used for qualifying dividends and imports of goods and services, the Venezuelan government has had a number of currency controls for companies operating in The Procter & Gamble Company 20 Venezuela. Through most of fiscal 2010, payments for certain imported goods and services that did not qualify for the official exchange rate had been satisfied by exchanging Bolivares Fuertes for U.S. dollars through securities transactions in the parallel market rather than at the more favorable official exchange rate. In fiscal 2010, the Venezuelan government enacted regulations that reduced the availability of foreign currency at the official exchange rate. That and an increased spread between the official and parallel exchange rates during most of fiscal 2010 resulted in increased costs for exchange transactions executed using securities transactions in the parallel market during fiscal 2010. The parallel market is now controlled by The Central Bank of Venezuela as the only legal intermediary to execute foreign exchange transactions outside of CADIVI. This is done through the SITME rate, which was approximately 5.3 as of June 30, 2012. The notional amount of transactions that run through this foreign exchange rate for non-essential goods is restrictive, which has essentially eliminated our ability to access any foreign exchange rate other than through the official CADIVI rate to pay for imported goods and/or manage our local monetary asset balances. Finally, the Venezuelan government enacted a price control law during the second half of fiscal 2012 that negatively impacted the net selling prices of certain products sold in Venezuela. This impact was not significant for the fiscal year.As of June 30, 2012, we had net monetary assets denominated in local currency of approximately $1.1 billion. Approximately $338 million of this balance has been remeasured using the SITME parallel rate because we plan to use this amount of the net monetary assets (largely cash) to satisfy U.S. dollar denominated liabilities that do not qualify for official rate dollars. However, as noted in the preceding paragraph, the availability of the parallel market to settle these transactions is uncertain. The remaining net monetary asset balances are currently reflected within our Consolidated Financial Statements at the 4.3 official exchange rate. Depending on the future availability of U.S. dollars at the official rate, our local U.S. dollar needs, our overall repatriation plans and the creditworthiness of the local depository institutions and other creditors, we have exposure for our local monetary assets. We also have devaluation exposure for the differential between the current and potential future official and parallel exchange rates.Our ability to effectively manage sales and profit levels in Venezuela will be impacted by several factors. These include the Company's ability to mitigate the effect of the recently enacted price controls, any potential future devaluation, any further Venezuelan government price or exchange controls, economic conditions and availability of raw materials and utilities.SEGMENT RESULTSSegment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. The results of these reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs such as interest expense, investing activities and certain restructuring and asset impairment costs. These costs are reported in our Corporate segment and are included as part of our Corporate segment discussion. Additionally, as described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have investments in certain companies over which we exert significant influence, but do not control the financial and operating decisions and, therefore, do not consolidate these companies for U.S. GAAP purposes (""unconsolidated entities""). Given that certain of these investments are managed as integral parts of the Company's business units, they are accounted for as if they were consolidated subsidiaries for management and segment reporting purposes. This means pre-tax earnings in the business units include 100% of each pre-tax income statement component. In determining after-tax earnings in the business units, we eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest, and apply the statutory tax rates. Eliminations to adjust each line item to U.S. GAAP are included in our Corporate segment. All references to net earnings throughout the discussion of segment results refer to net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Procter & Gamble.Net Sales Change Drivers vs. Year Ago (2012 vs. 2011)Volume withAcquisitions& Divestitures VolumeExcludingAcquisitions& Divestitures ForeignExchange Price Mix/Other Net SalesGrowthBeauty2 % 2 % 0 % 3% -3 % 2%Grooming1 % 1 % -1 % 2% -1 % 1%Health Care1 % 0 % 0 % 3% -1 % 3%Fabric Care and Home Care-1 % -1 % 0 % 5% -1 % 3%Baby Care and Family Care1 % 1 % 0 % 5% 0 % 6%TOTAL COMPANY0 % 0 % 0 % 4% -1 % 3%Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied.21 The Procter & Gamble CompanyBEAUTY($ millions)2012 Change vs.Prior Year 2011 Change vs.Prior YearVolumen/a +2 % n/a +4 %Net sales$20,318 +2 % $19,937 +4 %Net earnings$2,390 -6 % $2,542 -1 %Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011Beauty net sales increased 2% to $20.3 billion in 2012 on unit volume growth of 2%.

In the U.S., all-outlet share of the family care category increased half a point. Net earnings decreased 3% to $2.0 billion as net sales growth was more than offset by a 120-basis point reduction in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin declined mainly due to a lower gross margin, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The reduction in gross margin was driven by higher commodity costs and unfavorable product mix, behind disproportionate growth of mid-tier product lines, larger package sizes and developing regions, which were only partially offset by the favorable impact of volume scale leverage and manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales declined due to lower foreign currency exchange costs. CORPORATECorporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business units. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the historical results of certain divested brands and categories; certain asset impairment charges; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling items include income taxes (to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate), adjustments for unconsolidated entities (to eliminate net sales, cost of products sold and SG&A for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for U.S. GAAP) and noncontrolling interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have 100% ownership. Since certain unconsolidated entities and less than 100%-owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the related segments, they are accounted for similar to a wholly-owned subsidiary for management and segment purposes. This means our segment results recognize 100% of each income statement component through before-tax earnings in the segments, with eliminations for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests in Corporate. In determining segment net earnings, we apply the statutory tax rates (with adjustments to arrive at the Company's effective tax rate in Corporate) and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest.Corporate net sales primarily reflect the adjustment to eliminate the sales of unconsolidated entities included in business segment results. Accordingly, Corporate net sales are generally negative. Negative net sales in Corporate decreased by $108 million due to adjustments required to eliminate the lower net sales of unconsolidated entities. Net Corporate expenses increased $2.2 billion primarily due to the net after tax goodwill and intangibles impairment charges of $1.5 billion, incremental after-tax restructuring charges of $587 million and the impact of lower net discrete tax adjustments in the current year. Additional discussion of the items impacting net earnings in Corporate are included in the Results of Operations section.25 The Procter & Gamble CompanyIn 2011, negative net sales in Corporate were down $101 million due to adjustments required to eliminate lower sales of unconsolidated entities. Net income from continuing operations increased $1.3 billion to $498 million. The increase was due to net discrete adjustments to reverse reserves for uncertain tax positions, lower interest expense, a reduction in restructuring-type charges, divestiture gains and prior-period charges for the taxation of certain future retiree prescription drug subsidy payments in the U.S. Additional discussion of the items impacting net income in Corporate are included in the Results of Operations section above.Productivity and Cost Savings PlanIn February 2012, the Company announced a $10 billion productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The program was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. As part of this plan the Company expects to incur approximately $3.5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a four-year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2015). More than half of the costs will be incurred by the end of fiscal 2013 and the remainder in fiscal years 2014 and 2015. Savings generated from the restructuring costs are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the corollary benefits achieved, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. Overall, the costs are expected to deliver approximately $2 billion in before-tax annual savings. The before-tax savings in the current year are not material due to the timing of the plan. Restructuring accruals of $343 million as of June 30, 2012 are classified as current liabilities. Approximately 62% of the restructuring charges incurred during 2012 either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges will be funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. Refer to Note 3 in our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the productivity and cost savings plan.CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates.Operating cash flow provides the primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include acquisitions and share repurchases to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.Operating Cash FlowFiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011Operating cash flow was $13.3 billion in 2012, in line with the prior year. Operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation, asset impairments, deferred income taxes, and gains on sale of businesses), partially offset by working capital increases. Increased accounts receivable used $427 million of cash to fund growth. However, accounts receivable days sales outstanding were down 2 days primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange. Inventory generated $77 million of cash, mainly due to an increase in inventory management improvement efforts, partially offset by inventory to support product initiatives and to build stock to support capacity expansions and manufacturing sourcing changes. Inventory days on hand declined by 10 days primarily due to inventory management improvement efforts and the impact of foreign exchange. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities used $22 million of cash, due primarily to the payment of fines related to violations of the European competition laws. Cash flow from discontinued operations contributed approximately $200 million to operating cash flow.Fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010Operating cash flow was $13.3 billion in 2011, a 17% decrease versus the prior year. Operating cash flow resulted primarily from net earnings adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes and gain on the sale of businesses), partially offset by an increase in working capital. The net of accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable consumed $569 million of operating cash flow in 2011 mainly due to increases in inventories and accounts receivables. Inventory consumed $501 million driven by higher commodity costs, business growth and increased stock levels in advance of initiatives and sourcing changes. Inventory days on hand increased by five days due to the impact of foreign exchange, higher commodity costs and increased safety stock levels. Accounts receivable used $426 million primarily to support business growth. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding were up three days due to timing of sales and the impact of foreign exchange. Inventory and accounts receivable increases were partially offset by accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities, which increased by $358 million to support business growth. Other operating assets and liabilities were also a significant use of operating cash flow due primarily to net reductions in reserves for uncertain tax positions and an increase in the amount of value added taxes due from various governmental authorities. In the prior year, working The Procter & Gamble Company 26 capital was a net source of cash. Free Cash Flow. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends and other discretionary investment. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation. Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011Free cash flow was $9.3 billion in 2012, a decrease of 7% versus the prior year. Free cash flow decreased primarily due to higher capital spending to support geographic expansion. Free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings, was 85% in 2012. Fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010In 2011, free cash flow was $10.0 billion, a decrease of 23% versus the prior year. Free cash flow decreased due to lower operating cash flow and higher capital spending. Free cash flow productivity was 84% in 2011. Investing Cash FlowsFiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011Net investing activities consumed $1.1 billion in cash in 2012 mainly due to capital spending, partially offset by proceeds from asset sales of $2.9 billion. These proceeds were primarily related to cash received from the sale of our snacks business in 2012. Fiscal year 2011 compared with fiscal year 2010In 2011, net investing activities consumed $3.5 billion of cash due to capital spending and acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from asset sales. Capital Spending. We view capital spending efficiency as a critical component of our overall cash management strategy. We manage capital spending to support our business growth plans and have cost controls to deliver our cash generation targets. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost savings, were $4.0 billion in 2012 and $3.3 billion in 2011. The increase in capital spending resulted primarily from capacity expansions. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points to 4.7% in 2012. Capital spending for our discontinued snacks business was approximately $60 million in 2012. As we continue to support growth, capital spending in total and as a percentage of net sales is expected to increase in fiscal 2013. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points to 4.1% in 2011.Acquisitions. Acquisitions used $134 million of cash in 2012 primarily for the acquisition of New Chapter, a vitamins supplement business. In 2011, acquisitions used $474 million of cash primarily for the acquisition of Ambi Pur, an air freshener business. Proceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $2.9 billion to cash in 2012 mainly due to the sale of our snacks business. In 2011, proceeds from asset sales contributed $225 million to cash mainly due to the sale of our Infasil brand in Western Europe and Zest brand in North America. Financing Cash FlowsDividend Payments. Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments. Dividends per common share increased 8% to $2.14 per share in 2012. Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $6.1 billion in 2012 and $5.8 billion in 2011. The increase in dividend payments resulted from increases in our quarterly dividends per share, partially offset by a reduction in the number of shares outstanding. In April 2012, the Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.525 to $0.562 per share on Common Stock and Series A and B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock. This represents a 7% increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 56th consecutive year that our dividend has increased. We have paid a dividend in every year since our incorporation in 1890.Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $29.8 billion as of June 30, 2012 and $32.0 billion as of June 30, 2011. Our total debt decreased in 2012 mainly due to bonds reaching maturity and a reduction in commercial paper outstanding, partially offset by debt issuances.Treasury Purchases. Total share repurchases were $4.0 billion in 2012 and $7.0 billion in 2011. LiquidityAt June 30, 2012 our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $3.0 billion, largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements.On June 30, 2012, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard & Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings are Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard & Poor's), both with a stable outlook.27 The Procter & Gamble CompanyWe maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. These facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in, and in accordance with, the terms of each credit agreement. The current facility is an $11.0 billion facility split between a $7.0 billion 5-year facility and a $4.0 billion 364-day facility, which expire in August 2017 and August 2013, respectively. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain largely undrawn for the foreseeable future. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities.Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity. Contractual CommitmentsThe following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2012.($ millions)Total Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 YearsRECORDED LIABILITIES Total debt$29,490 $8,672 $6,927 $3,356 $10,535Capital leases45 16 14 14 1Uncertain tax positions(1)33 33 — — —OTHER Interest payments relating to long-term debt8,866 909 1,546 1,170 5,241Operating leases(2)1,817 289 498 393 637Minimum pension funding(3)1,032 352 680 — —Purchase obligations(4)2,187 1,094 596 215 282TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS$43,470 $11,365 $10,261 $5,148 $16,696(1) As of June 30, 2012, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $2.3 billion, including $505 million of interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of June 30, 2012 cannot be made.(2) Operating lease obligations are shown net of guaranteed sublease income.(3) Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the above future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2015 are not currently determinable.(4) Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent future purchases in line with expected usage to obtain favorable pricing. Approximately 22% relates to service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include obligations related to the put of our Spanish joint venture discussed further in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (approximately $1 billion) and other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.The Procter & Gamble Company 28 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include income taxes, certain employee benefits and acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.The Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. For additional details on the Company's income taxes, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Employee BenefitsWe sponsor various post-employment benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense, since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPEB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2012, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPEB assets were 7.4% and 9.2%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPEB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $90 million.Since pension and OPEB liabilities are measured on a 29 The Procter & Gamble Companydiscounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans of 4.2% and 4.3% respectively, represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100-basis point change in the pension discount rate would impact annual after-tax defined benefit pension expense by approximately $160 million. A change in the OPEB discount rate of 100 basis points would impact annual after-tax OPEB expense by approximately $70 million. For additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangible AssetsWe account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the purchase method, our Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill.Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain.We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants, and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, economic barriers to entry, a brand's relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors. All of our acquired technology and customer-related intangibles are expected to have determinable useful lives. The costs of determinable-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life. The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. We test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reportable unit level. We test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual book values compared to the fair value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, indefinite-lived intangible assets may be reclassified to a determinable life asset and an additional impairment assessment may be performed. During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from July 1 to October 1 of each year. This change was made to better align the timing of our annual impairment testing with the timing of the Company's annual strategic planning process. We tested goodwill for impairment as of July 1, 2011 (the testing date under our previous policy) and no impairments were indicated. The results of our impairment testing during the quarter ended December 31, 2011, indicated that the estimated fair values of our Appliances and Salon Professional reporting units were less than their respective carrying amount therefore we recorded a non-cash before and after tax impairment charge of $1.3 billion. Additionally, our impairment testing for indefinite lived intangible assets during the quarter ended December 31, 2011 indicated a decline in the fair value of our Koleston Perfect and Wella trade name intangible assets below their respective carrying values. This resulted in a non-cash before tax impairment charge of $246 million ($173 million The Procter & Gamble Company 30 after tax) to reduce the carrying amounts of these assets to their respective fair values. The Appliances business was acquired as part of the Gillette acquisition and is a stand-alone goodwill reporting unit. The Salon Professional business consists primarily of operations acquired in the Wella acquisition in 2004. These businesses represent some of our more discretionary consumer spending categories. As of June 30, 2012, the Appliances business has remaining goodwill of $586 million, while the Salon Professional business has remaining goodwill of $397 million. As a result of the current year impairments, the estimated fair values of our Appliances and Salon Professional businesses approximate their carrying values. Because purchases in these categories are more discretionary in nature, their operations and underlying fair values were disproportionately impacted by the economic downturn that began in fiscal 2009, which led to a reduction in home and personal grooming appliance purchases and in visits to hair salons. Our valuation of the Appliances and Salon Professional businesses has them returning to sales and earnings growth rates consistent with our long-term business plans. Failure to achieve these business plans or a further deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions could result in a valuation that would trigger an additional impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses. For additional details on the timing and results of our goodwill impairment testing, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other than as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, our annual impairment testing for both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets indicated that all other reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset fair values significantly exceeded their respective recorded values. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in additional impairment charges that could materially affect the financial statements in any given year. The recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets from recently impaired businesses and recently acquired businesses are derived from more recent business operating plans and macroeconomic environmental conditions and therefore are more susceptible to an adverse change that could require an impairment charge.For example, the Gillette intangible and goodwill amounts represent values as of a relatively more recent acquisition date and, as such, the amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate. Gillette indefinite-lived intangible assets represent approximately 90% of the $26.7 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets at June 30, 2012. Goodwill allocated to stand-alone reporting units consisting primarily of businesses purchased as part of the Gillette acquisition represents 43% of the $53.8 billion of goodwill at June 30, 2012. This includes the Shave Care and Appliance businesses, which are components of the Grooming segment, and the Batteries business, which is part of the Fabric Care and Home Care segment.New Accounting PronouncementsThere are no new accounting pronouncements issued or effective that will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. However, we will be presenting Comprehensive Income in a new format beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, in accordance with new accounting guidance that will eliminate the option of presenting components of other comprehensive earnings as part of the statement of shareholders' equity. For additional details, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.OTHER INFORMATIONHedging and Derivative Financial InstrumentsAs a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. Except within financing operations, we leverage the Company's broadly diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes a detailed discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments. Derivative positions can be monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the CorporateManager™ value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics™ dataset as of June 30, 2012. In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics™, a reasonable proxy is included.Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that 31 The Procter & Gamble Companywould significantly impact such exposures in the near term.Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments.Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June 30, 2012, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements.Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with our financing operations, we primarily use forward contracts with maturities of less than 18 months. In addition, we enter into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions.Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2012, we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements.Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. In addition to fixed price contracts, we may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures.As of and during the year ended June 30, 2012, we did not have material commodity hedging activity.Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAPOur discussion of financial results includes several ""non-GAAP"" financial measures. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MD&A, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion. These measures include: Organic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Organic sales is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.The following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth: Year ended June 30, 2012Net SalesGrowth ForeignExchangeImpact Acquisition/DivestitureImpact* OrganicSalesGrowthBeauty2% 0 % 0 % 2%Grooming1% 1 % 0 % 2%Health Care3% 0 % -1 % 2%Fabric Care and Home Care3% 0 % 0 % 3%Baby Care and Family Care6% 0 % 0 % 6%TOTAL P&G3% 0 % 0 % 3% Year ended June 30, 2011Net SalesGrowth ForeignExchangeImpact Acquisition/DivestitureImpact* OrganicSalesGrowthBeauty4% -1 % 0 % 3%Grooming5% 0 % 0 % 5%Health Care5% 0 % 0 % 5%Fabric Care and Home Care4% 0 % -2 % 2%Baby Care and Family Care6% 1 % 0 % 7%TOTAL P&G5% 0 % -1 % 4% * Acquisition/Divestiture Impact includes rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales.Core EPS. This is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. This includes current year impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, current year charges related to incremental restructuring charges due to increased focus on productivity and cost savings, a significant benefit in 2011 from the settlement of U.S. tax litigation primarily related to the valuation of technology donations, charges in 2012, 2011 and 2010 related to pending European legal matters, and a 2010 charge related to a tax provision for retiree healthcare subsidy payments in the U.S. healthcare reform legislation. The Procter & Gamble Company 32 We do not view these items to be part of our sustainable results. We believe the Core EPS measure provides an important perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year earnings per share growth. Core EPS is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. The table below provides a reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to Core EPS: Years ended June 302012 2011 2010Diluted Net Earnings Per Share - Continuing Operations$3.12 $3.85 $3.47Impairment Charges0.51 — —Incremental Restructuring Charges0.20 — —Settlement from U.S. Tax Litigation— (0.08) —Charges for Pending European Legal Matters0.03 0.10 0.09Charge for Taxation of Retiree Healthcare Subsidy— — 0.05Rounding(0.01) — —CORE EPS$3.85 $3.87 $3.61Core EPS Growth(1)% 7% Note - All reconciling items are presented net of tax. Tax effects are calculated consistent with the nature of the underlying transaction. The significant adjustment to an income tax reserve was tax expense. There was no tax impact on EPS due to the charges for pending European legal matters.Free Cash Flow. Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends and discretionary investment. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.Free Cash Flow Productivity. Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. Free cash flow productivity is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow productivity ($ millions): OperatingCash FlowCapitalSpendingFreeCash FlowNetEarningsFreeCash FlowProductivity2012$13,284$(3,964)$9,320$10,90485%201113,330(3,306)10,02411,92784%201016,131(3,067)13,06412,846102% Item 7A.

Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section titled ""Economic Conditions, Challenges and Risks"" and the section titled “Risk Factors” (Item 1A of this Form 10-K). Forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this report and we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise.The following Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended to provide the reader with an understanding of P&G's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. MD&A is organized in the following sections:•Overview•Summary of 2013 Results •Economic Conditions, Challenges and Risks•Results of Operations•Segment Results•Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity•Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates•Other Information Throughout MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), free cash flow and free cash flow productivity. Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain specified charges and gains. Free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending. Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. The explanation at the end of MD&A provides more details on the use and derivation of these measures.Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category and are measured on an annual basis versus the prior 12 month period. References to competitive activity include promotional and product initiatives from our competitors.OVERVIEWP&G is a global leader in retail goods focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, salons and high-frequency stores. We continue to expand our presence in other channels, including perfumeries, pharmacies and e-commerce. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.24 The Procter & Gamble CompanyORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTUREOur organizational structure is comprised of Global Business Units (GBUs), Global Operations, Global Business Services (GBS) and Corporate Functions (CF).Global Business UnitsUnder U.S. GAAP, the GBUs are aggregated into five reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby Care and Family Care. The GBUs are responsible for developing overall brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovations and marketing plans. The following provides additional detail on our reportable segments and the key product categories and brand composition within each segment.Reportable Segment% ofNet Sales*% of NetEarnings*GBUs (Categories)Billion Dollar BrandsBeauty24%21%Beauty Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Cosmetics, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); Hair Care and Color; Prestige (SK-II, Fragrances); Salon ProfessionalHead & Shoulders, Olay, Pantene, SK-II, WellaGrooming9%16%Shave Care (Blades and Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products); Braun and AppliancesFusion, Gillette, Mach3, PrestobarbaHealth Care15%17%Feminine Care (Feminine Care, Incontinence); Oral Care (Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Other Personal Health Care, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements)Always, Crest, Oral-B, VicksFabric Care and Home Care32%27%Fabric Care (Bleach and Laundry Additives, Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, Surface Care); Personal Power (Batteries); Pet Care; ProfessionalAce, Ariel, Dawn, Downy, Duracell, Febreze, Gain, Iams, TideBaby Care and Family Care20%19%Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper)Bounty, Charmin, Pampers* Percent of net sales and net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2013 (excluding results held in Corporate).Recent Developments: In fiscal 2012, we completed the divestiture of our snacks business to The Kellogg Company. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of our snacks business are presented as discontinued operations in 2012 and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and from segment results for all periods presented. Beauty: We are a global market leader in the beauty category. Most of the beauty markets in which we compete are highly fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. We compete in beauty care, hair care and color and prestige. In beauty care, we offer a wide variety of products, ranging from deodorants to cosmetics to skin care, such as our Olay brand, which is the top facial skin care brand in the world with approximately 10% global market share. In hair care and color, we compete in both the retail and salon professional channels. We are the global market leader in the hair care and color market with over 20% global market share behind our Pantene and Head & Shoulders brands. In the prestige channel, we compete primarily with our prestige fragrances and the SK-II brand. We are the global market leader in prestige fragrances, primarily behind our Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci and Hugo Boss fragrance brands. Grooming: We are the global market leader in the blades and razors market globally and in nearly all of the geographies in which we compete. Our global blades and razors market share is approximately 70%, primarily behind the Gillette franchise including Fusion, Mach3, Prestobarba and Venus. Our electronic hair removal devices, such as electric razors and epilators, are sold under the Braun brand in a number of markets around the world where we compete against both global and regional competitors. We hold over 20% of the male shavers market and over 40% of the female epilators market.Health Care: We compete in oral care, feminine care and personal health care. In oral care, there are several global competitors in the market and we have the number two market share position with approximately 20% global market share. We are the global market leader in the feminine care category with over 30% global market share. In personal health care, we are the global market leader in nonprescription heartburn medications behind our Prilosec OTC brand and in respiratory treatments behind our Vicks brand. Nearly all of our sales outside the U.S in personal health are generated through the PGT Healthcare partnership with Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd. The Procter & Gamble Company 25 Fabric Care and Home Care: This segment is comprised of a variety of fabric care products, including: laundry detergents, additives and fabric enhancers; home care products, including dishwashing liquids and detergents, surface cleaners and air fresheners; batteries; and pet care. In fabric care, we generally have the number one or number two share position in the markets in which we compete and are the global market leader, with over 25% global market share, primarily behind our Tide, Ariel and Downy brands. Our global home care market share is approximately 20% across the categories in which we compete. In batteries, we have over 25% global battery market share, behind our Duracell brand. In pet care, we compete in several markets primarily in the premium pet care segment, with the Iams and Eukanuba brands. The vast majority of our pet care business is in North America, where we have over 5% market share.Baby Care and Family Care: In baby care, we compete mainly in diapers, pants and baby wipes, with approximately 35% global market share. We are the number one or number two baby care competitor in most of the key markets in which we compete, primarily behind Pampers, the Company's largest brand, with annual net sales of more than $10 billion. Our family care business is predominantly a North American business comprised largely of the Bounty paper towel and Charmin toilet paper brands. U.S. market shares are approximately 45% for Bounty and over 25% for Charmin.Fiscal Year 2014 Changes to Global Business Unit StructureWe recently announced a number of changes to our GBU structure, which will result in changes to our reportable segments. Effective July 1, 2013, as part of our plan to improve business performance, we organized our Global Business Units into four industry-based sectors, comprised of 1) Global Baby, Feminine and Family Care, 2) Global Beauty, 3) Global Health and Grooming, and 4) Global Fabric and Home Care. Under U.S. GAAP, the GBUs underlying these sectors will be aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Global Baby, Feminine and Family Care, 2) Global Beauty, 3) Global Health, 4) Grooming and 5) Global Fabric and Home Care. As a result, Feminine Care will transition from Health Care to Global Baby, Feminine and Family Care. Additionally, Pet Care will transition from Fabric Care and Home Care to Global Health.These changes will be reflected in our segment reporting beginning in fiscal year 2014, at which time our historical segment reporting will also be restated to reflect the new structure. The segment discussions in MD&A and the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the organizational structure that existed through June 30, 2013.Global OperationsGlobal Operations is comprised of our Market Development Organization (MDO), which is responsible for developing go-to-market plans at the local level. The MDO includes dedicated retail customer, trade channel and country-specific teams. It is organized along five geographic regions: North America, Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa (CEEMEA), Latin America and Asia, which is comprised of Japan, Greater China and ASEAN/Australia/India/Korea (AAIK). Throughout MD&A, we reference business results in developing markets, which we define as the aggregate of CEEMEA, Latin America, AAIK and Greater China, and developed markets, which are comprised of North America, Western Europe and Japan.Global Business ServicesGBS provides technology, processes and standard data tools to enable the GBUs and the MDO to better understand the business and better serve consumers and customers. The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class solutions at a low cost and with minimal capital investment.Corporate FunctionsCF provides Company-level strategy and portfolio analysis, corporate accounting, treasury, tax, external relations, governance, human resources and legal, as well as other centralized functional support.STRATEGIC FOCUSWe are focused on strategies that we believe are right for the long-term health of the Company with the objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. We are focusing our resources on our leading, most profitable categories and markets. •We will focus on our core markets, such as the U.S., to strengthen and grow these businesses. •We will focus our developing market investments on the categories and countries with the largest size of prize and highest likelihood of winning.•We will focus the portfolio, allocating resources to businesses where we can create disproportionate value. To create flexibility to fund our growth efforts and deliver our financial commitments, we are working to make productivity a core strength for P&G. We have taken significant steps to accelerate cost savings, including a five-year cost savings initiative which was announced in February 2012. The cost savings program covers all elements of costs including cost of goods sold, marketing expense and non-manufacturing overhead.Innovation has always been - and continues to be - P&G's lifeblood. To consistently win with consumers around the world across price tiers and preferences and to consistently win versus our best competitors, each P&G product category needs a full portfolio of innovation, including a mix of commercial programs, product improvements and game-changing innovations.26 The Procter & Gamble CompanyFinally, we are focused on improving operating discipline in everything we do. Executing better than our competitors is how we win with customers and consumers and generate leadership returns for our shareholders.Given current market growth rates, the Company expects the consistent delivery of the following annual financial targets will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive peer group:•Grow organic sales modestly above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete,•Deliver Core EPS growth of high single digits, and•Generate free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater.

All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are ""forward-looking statements"" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors in this 10-K.Ability to Achieve Business Plans. We are a consumer products company and rely on continued demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail The Procter & Gamble Company 27 trade customers. Our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation with respect to both products and operations, on the continued positive reputations of our brands and our ability to successfully maintain trademark protection. This means we must be able to obtain patents and trademarks, and respond to technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our success is also dependent on effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. Our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing net sales and volume profitably, especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets (including developing markets) in which we have chosen to focus. There are high levels of competitive activity in the environments in which we operate. To address these challenges, we must respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives, trade terms and product initiatives. We must manage each of these factors, as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, in order to effectively compete and achieve our business plans. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of ongoing acquisition, divestiture and joint venture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against base business objectives. Daily conduct of our business also depends on our ability to maintain key information technology systems, including systems operated by third-party suppliers and to maintain security over our data.Cost Pressures. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, labor costs, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects, sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions, as well as consistent productivity improvements. We also must manage our debt and currency exposure, especially in certain countries with currency exchange controls, such as Venezuela, China, India, Egypt and Argentina. We need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier and manufacturing plant arrangements, and successfully manage any disruptions at Company manufacturing sites. We must implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including our outsourcing projects and those related to general overhead and workforce optimization. Successfully managing these changes, including identifying, developing and retaining key employees, is critical to our success.Global Economic Conditions. Demand for our products has a correlation to global macroeconomic factors. The current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic. Economic changes, terrorist activity, political unrest and natural disasters may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographic markets, due to terrorist and other hostile activities or natural disasters. We could also be negatively impacted by a global, regional or national economic crisis, including sovereign risk in the event of a deterioration in the credit worthiness of, or a default by local governments, resulting in a disruption of credit markets. Such events could negatively impact our ability to collect receipts due from governments, including refunds of value added taxes, create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions and/or negatively impact our overall liquidity. Additionally, changes in exchange controls and other limits could impact our ability to repatriate earnings from overseas.Regulatory Environment. Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and tax laws or the enforcement thereof. Our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including, but not limited to, product liability, patent and other intellectual property matters) and to resolve pending legal matters within current estimates may impact our results.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A), other non-operating items and income taxes. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, geographic expansion and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as pricing actions (which can also indirectly impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the U.S.Most of our cost of products sold and SG&A are to some extent variable in nature. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, product and geographic mix (for example, gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and to a lesser extent scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary drivers of SG&A are marketing-related costs and overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we do achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. Overhead costs are also variable in nature, but on a relative basis, less so than marketing costs due to our 28 The Procter & Gamble Companyability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth. Accordingly, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs. In February and November 2012, the Company made announcements related to a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overhead expenses. The plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes in order to help fund the Company's growth strategy. The Company expects to incur in excess of $3.5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a five-year period (fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2016) as part of this plan. Overall, the costs are expected to deliver in excess of $2.0 billion in before-tax annual savings.Net SalesFiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012Net sales increased 1% to $84.2 billion in 2013 on a 2% increase in unit volume. Volume in Baby Care and Family Care grew mid-single digits. Volume in Fabric Care and Home Care and in Health Care grew low single digits. Beauty volume was in line with the prior year. Grooming volume decreased low single digits. Volume grew low single digits in both developed and developing regions. The impact of overall global market growth was partially offset by market share declines in certain categories. Price increases added 1% to net sales, driven by price increases across all business segments, primarily executed in prior periods to offset cost increases and devaluing developing market currencies. Foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%. Organic sales growth was 3% driven by both volume and price increases.Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011Net sales increased 3% to $83.7 billion in 2012 on unit volume that was consistent with the prior year period. Difficult macroeconomic conditions caused a slowdown in market growth in fiscal 2012, particularly in developed markets. In addition, we initiated a number of price increases across each reportable segment in fiscal 2012, in large part to recover the rising cost of commodities and currency devaluations. These factors negatively impacted volume growth in 2012, but the price increases led to higher overall sales. Volume grew low single digits in Beauty, Grooming, Health Care, and Baby Care and Family Care. Fabric Care and Home Care volume decreased low single digits. Volume grew mid-single digits in developing regions and was down low single digits in developed regions. The impact of overall global market growth was partially offset by market share declines in certain categories. Price increases added 4% to net sales, driven by price increases across all business segments and regions, primarily to help offset commodity costs and devaluing currencies in certain developing markets. Mix reduced net sales by 1% due to unfavorable geographic mix across the Beauty, Grooming, Health Care and Fabric Care and Home Care reportable segments and unfavorable product mix. Foreign exchange was neutral to net sales. Organic sales growth was 3% driven by price increases.Operating CostsComparisons as a percentage of net sales; Years ended June 302013 Basis PointChange 2012 Basis PointChange 2011Gross margin49.6% 30 49.3% (160) 50.9%Selling, general and administrative expense32.0% 50 31.5% (30) 31.8%Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset and impairment charges0.4% (150) 1.9% 190 —%Operating margin17.2% 130 15.9% (320) 19.1%Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes17.6% 230 15.3% (320) 18.5%Net earnings from continuing operations13.5% 240 11.1% (330) 14.4%Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble13.4% 50 12.9% (170) 14.6%Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012Gross margin expanded 30 basis points in 2013 to 49.6% of net sales, driven by higher pricing and manufacturing cost savings, partially offset by negative mix and higher commodity costs. Gross margin was positively impacted by 70 basis points from higher pricing and approximately 160 basis points from manufacturing cost savings. Gross margin was negatively impacted by 160 basis points from negative geographic and product mix behind disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier products, both of which have lower gross margins than the Company average. Gross margin was also reduced by capacity investments and to a lesser extent by foreign exchange impacts and higher commodity costs. Total SG&A increased 2% to $27.0 billion in 2013, driven by a charge for the balance sheet impact from the devaluation of the official foreign exchange rate in Venezuela and an increase in marketing spending, partially The Procter & Gamble Company 29 offset by reduced overhead costs as a result of the productivity and cost savings plan. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 50 basis points to 32.0% largely due to a 40 basis point impact from the Venezuela devaluation charge and a 10 basis point increase in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales declined 20 basis points, as a 70-basis point benefit from our productivity and cost savings plan and 20 basis points of lower restructuring costs were largely offset by the impact of foreign exchange. This was due to a higher portion of SG&A spending in strengthening currencies as compared to net sales, higher employee wages and benefit costs and increased merchandising investments.In fiscal 2013 we incurred impairment charges of $308 million ($290 million after-tax) related to the carrying value of goodwill in our Appliances business and the related Braun trade name intangible asset. In fiscal 2012 we incurred impairment charges of $1.6 billion ($1.5 billion after-tax) related to the carrying values of goodwill in our Appliances and Salon Professional businesses and our Koleston Perfect and Wella indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are part of our Salon Professional business. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details, including factors leading to the impairment charges. Since goodwill is included in Corporate for internal management and segment reporting, the goodwill impairment charges are included in the Corporate segment. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments are also included in the Corporate segment for management and segment reporting. Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011Gross margin contracted 160 basis points in 2012 to 49.3% of net sales. The reduction in gross margin was driven mainly by a 230-basis point impact from higher commodity and energy costs. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by 200 basis points from negative geographic and product mix and by 30 basis points from the impact of increased restructuring spending due to the productivity and cost savings plan. The negative mix resulted from disproportionate growth in developing regions, as developing regions have lower relative gross margins than developed regions. These impacts were partially offset by a 200-basis point impact from increased pricing and a 140-basis point impact from manufacturing cost savings.Total SG&A increased 3% to $26.4 billion in 2012, driven by higher marketing spending to support initiative activity and a $510 million increase in restructuring spending from our productivity and cost savings plan, partially offset by a reduction in competition law fines (see Item 3 of this Form 10-K and Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), which were $303 million in 2011 compared to $75 million in 2012. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points to 31.5%, as reduced competition law fines and the impact of increased scale leverage on marketing and overhead costs from higher sales were partially offset by 60 basis points of incremental restructuring costs. Non-Operating ItemsFiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012Interest expense decreased 13% in 2013 to $667 million, due to lower interest rates on floating-rate debt. Interest income increased 13% in 2013 to $87 million, due to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and debt securities. Other non-operating income, net primarily includes divestiture gains and investment income. Other non-operating income increased $757 million to $942 million in 2013 mainly due to net acquisition and divestiture activities. A holding gain of $631 million resulting from the purchase of the balance of P&G's Baby Care and Feminine Care joint venture in Iberia and a gain of approximately $250 million from the sale of our Italian bleach business, both in the current year, were partially offset by a $130 million divestiture gain from the PUR water filtration business in the prior year period.Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011In 2012, interest expense decreased 7% to $769 million, due to lower interest rates on floating-rate debt and a decrease in average debt outstanding. Interest income increased 24% in 2012 to $77 million, due to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and debt securities. Other non-operating income, net decreased $86 million to $185 million in 2012 mainly behind the impact of minor brand divestitures. A divestiture gain from the sale of the PUR water filtration brand in fiscal 2012 was less than the Zest and Infasil divestiture gains in fiscal 2011.Income TaxesFiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 390 basis points to 23.2% in 2013. The primary drivers of this rate decline were as follows:•Approximately 210 basis points due to the non-deductibility of impairment charges related to our Appliances and Salon Professional businesses, which were higher in the base period versus the current year. •Approximately 100 basis points due to the tax impacts from acquisition and divestiture activity (primarily the non-taxable gain on the purchase of the balance of the Baby Care and Feminine Care joint venture in Iberia). •Approximately 50 basis points due to the net impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions. The current year net benefit was $275, or 180 basis points, versus a net benefit of 130 basis points in the prior year.•Approximately 20 basis points from the impact of the Venezuela currency devaluation.30 The Procter & Gamble CompanyFiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011In 2012, the effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 510 basis points to 27.1% primarily due to a 250-basis point impact from the non-deductibility of impairment charges in fiscal 2012 and the net impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions, which drove 250 basis points of the tax rate difference. The net benefit from favorable discrete adjustments was $165 million in fiscal 2012, which netted to 130 basis points, versus 380 basis points of net benefits in fiscal 2011.Net EarningsFiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012Net earnings from continuing operations increased $2.1 billion or 22% to $11.4 billion in 2013. The combination of the net year-over-year impact of acquisition and divestiture gains and the net year-over-year decline in impairment charges drove $1.9 billion of the increase. Earnings also increased due to the increase in net sales and the 30-basis point gross margin expansion in the current year. Net earnings from discontinued operations decreased $1.6 billion in 2013 due to the gain on the divestiture of the snacks business and the earnings from the snacks business prior to the divestiture in the prior year period. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $556 million, or 5% to $11.3 billion.Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 24% to $3.86 due to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in shares outstanding. The number of shares outstanding decreased due to $6.0 billion of treasury share repurchases under our publicly announced share repurchase program, partially offset by shares issued under share-based compensation plans. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations was $0.54 in the prior year period (zero in the current period) due to the gain on the divestiture of the snacks business and earnings of the snacks business prior to the divestiture. Diluted net earnings per share increased 5% to $3.86.Core EPS increased 5% to $4.05 primarily due to increased net sales, gross margin expansion and the reduction in shares outstanding. Core EPS represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the current period charge for the balance sheet impact from the devaluation of the official foreign exchange rate in Venezuela, the current year holding gain on the purchase of the balance of our Iberian joint venture and charges in both years for European legal matters, incremental restructuring related to our productivity and cost savings plan and impairments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011In 2012, net earnings from continuing operations decreased 20% to $9.3 billion as an increase in net sales was more than offset by the impact of impairment charges, incremental restructuring charges and an increase in income taxes. Operating margin declined 320 basis points due primarily to a 190-basis point impact from goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges in our Appliances and Salon Professional businesses and an 85-basis point impact from incremental restructuring charges. The impact of higher commodity costs and negative product mix was largely offset by higher pricing, manufacturing cost savings and increased scale leverage. Net earnings from discontinued operations increased $1.4 billion in 2012 due to the gain on the divestiture of the snacks business. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble declined 9% to $10.8 billion.Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 19% in 2012 to $3.12 due to the decline in net earnings, partially offset by a reduction in shares outstanding. The reduction in the number of shares outstanding was driven by treasury share repurchases of $4.0 billion, which were made under our publicly announced share repurchase program, partially offset by shares issued under share-based compensation plans. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations increased $0.46 due to the gain on the divestiture of the snacks business, partially offset by a decrease in the earnings of the snacks business prior to the divestiture. Diluted net earnings per share decreased 7% from the prior year to $3.66 in fiscal 2012. Core EPS in 2012 decreased 1% to $3.85. Venezuela Currency ImpactsVenezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. As a result, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Venezuela. Any currency remeasurement adjustments for non-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by these subsidiaries and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings. The Venezuelan government has established one official exchange rate for qualifying dividends and imported goods and services. That rate was equal to 4.3 Bolivares Fuertes (VEF) to one U.S. dollar through February 12, 2013. Effective February 13, 2013, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency relative to the U.S. dollar from 4.3 to 6.3 (official rate). The remeasurement of our balance sheets in 2013 to reflect the impact of the devaluation resulted in a net after-tax charge of $236 million ($0.08 per share). There will also be an ongoing impact related to translating our income statement at the new exchange rates. Moving from the 4.3 rate to the 6.3 rate will reduce future total Company reported net sales by less than 1% on a going basis. This does not impact our organic sales growth rate, which excludes the impact of foreign currency changes. Versus our existing business plans, the exchange rate change reduced our reported earnings per share by approximately $0.04 per share in 2013. The Procter & Gamble Company 31 Transactions at the official exchange rate are subject to CADIVI (Venezuelan government's Foreign Exchange Administrative Commission). Our overall results in Venezuela are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements at the official rate, which is currently the rate expected to be applicable to dividend repatriations.In addition to the official exchange rate, there had been a parallel exchange market (SITME) that was controlled by the Central Bank of Venezuela as the only legal intermediary to execute foreign exchange transactions outside of CADIVI. The published rate was 5.3 through February 12, 2013. The notional amount of transactions that ran through this foreign exchange rate for nonessential goods was restrictive, which for us essentially eliminated our ability to access any foreign exchange rate other than the official CADIVI rate to pay for imported goods and/or manage our local monetary asset balances. When the government devalued its currency in February, 2013, it also eliminated SITME, but established a new exchange rate market program, referred to as SICAD. As of June 30, 2013, there is little official information available on the new auction process or the underlying auction rates. As of June 30, 2013, we had net monetary assets denominated in local currency of $913 million. Local currency balances decreased 14% since June 30, 2012 due to the impact of the February 2013 devaluation and an increase in payments by the government through CADIVI, partially offset by an increase in the net amount of indirect value added taxes (VAT) receivable from the government from goods receipts and shipments. Prior to the February 2013 devaluation, a portion of our net monetary assets denominated in local currency was remeasured using the SITME rate because we planned to use that amount of the net assets (largely cash) to satisfy U.S. dollar denominated liabilities that do not qualify for official rate dollars. The remaining net monetary asset balances had been reflected within our Consolidated Financial Statements at the 4.3 official exchange rate. However, as noted in the preceding paragraph, the parallel SITME market was eliminated at the time of the February 2013 devaluation, and there is little information available on the SICAD mechanism. Accordingly, all of our net monetary assets are measured at the official 6.3 exchange rate at June 30, 2013.Additionally, the Venezuelan government enacted a price control law during the second half of fiscal 2012 that negatively impacted the net selling prices of certain products sold in Venezuela.Depending on the ultimate transparency and liquidity of the SICAD market, it is possible that we may remeasure a portion of our net monetary balances (the amount of the net assets needed to satisfy U.S. dollar denominated liabilities that do not qualify for official rate dollars, approximately $240 million as of June 30, 2013) at the SICAD rate. This would result in an additional devaluation charge. Over time, we intend to restore net sales and profit to levels achieved prior to the devaluation. However, our ability to do so will be impacted by several factors. These include the Company's ability to mitigate the effect of the recently enacted price controls, any potential future devaluation, any further Venezuelan government price or exchange controls, economic conditions and the availability of raw materials and utilities. In addition, depending on the future availability of U.S. dollars at the official rate, our local U.S. dollar needs, our overall repatriation plans, the creditworthiness of the local depository institutions and other creditors and our ability to collect amounts due from customers and the government, including VAT receivable, we may have exposure for our local monetary assets. We also have devaluation exposure for the differential between the current and potential future official exchange rates.SEGMENT RESULTSSegment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. The results of these reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs such as interest expense, investing activities and certain restructuring and asset impairment costs. These costs are reported in our Corporate segment and are included as part of our Corporate segment discussion. Additionally, as described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have investments in certain companies over which we exert significant influence, but do not control the financial and operating decisions and, therefore, do not consolidate these companies for U.S. GAAP purposes (""unconsolidated entities""). Given that certain of these investments are managed as integral parts of the Company's business units, they are accounted for as if they were consolidated subsidiaries for management and segment reporting purposes. This means pre-tax earnings in the business units include 100% of each pre-tax income statement component. In determining after-tax earnings in the business units, we eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest, and apply the statutory tax rates. Eliminations to adjust each line item to U.S. GAAP are included in our Corporate segment. All references to net earnings throughout the discussion of segment results refer to net earnings from continuing operations.32 The Procter & Gamble CompanyNet Sales Change Drivers (2013 vs. 2012) Volume withAcquisitions& Divestitures VolumeExcludingAcquisitions& Divestitures ForeignExchange Price Mix Other Net SalesGrowthBeauty0% 0% -2% 2% -1% -1% -2%Grooming-1% 0% -4% 2% 0% -1% -4%Health Care3% 3% -3% 1% 1% 1% 3%Fabric Care and Home Care3% 3% -2% 1% -1% 0% 1%Baby Care and Family Care4% 4% -2% 1% -1% 0% 2%TOTAL COMPANY2% 2% -2% 1% 0% 0% 1%Net Sales Change Drivers (2012 vs. 2011) Volume withAcquisitions& Divestitures VolumeExcludingAcquisitions& Divestitures ForeignExchange Price Mix Other Net SalesGrowthBeauty2% 2% 0% 3% -3% 0% 2%Grooming1% 1% -1% 2% -1% 0% 1%Health Care1% 0% 0% 3% -1% 0% 3%Fabric Care and Home Care-1% -1% 0% 5% -1% 0% 3%Baby Care and Family Care1% 1% 0% 5% 0% 0% 6%TOTAL COMPANY0% 0% 0% 4% -1% 0% 3%Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied.

Organic volume in Prestige increased low single digits. Net earnings increased 4% to $2.5 billion, as lower net sales were more than offset by a 60-basis point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to gross margin expansion, a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales and a lower effective tax rate. Gross margin increased behind manufacturing cost savings and higher pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales declined largely due to reduced overhead spending. The effective tax rate declined due to the geographic mix of earnings.Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011Beauty net sales increased 2% to $20.3 billion in 2012 on unit volume growth of 2%.

CORPORATE($ millions)2013 Change vs 2012 2012 Change vs2011Net sales$(895) -22% $(1,145) -9%Net earnings$(175) N/A $(1,744) N/ACorporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business units. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the historical results of certain divested brands and categories; certain asset impairment charges; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling items include income taxes (to adjust from statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate), adjustments for unconsolidated entities (to eliminate net sales, cost of products sold and SG&A for entities that are consolidated in the segments but accounted for using the equity method for U.S. GAAP) and noncontrolling interest adjustments for subsidiaries where we do not have 100% ownership. Since certain unconsolidated entities and less than 100%-owned subsidiaries are managed as integral parts of the related segments, they are accounted for similar to a wholly-owned subsidiary for management and segment purposes. This means our segment results recognize 100% of each income statement component through before-tax earnings in the segments, with eliminations for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests in Corporate. In determining segment net earnings, we apply the statutory tax rates (with adjustments to arrive at the Company's effective tax rate in Corporate) and eliminate the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest.Corporate net sales primarily reflect the adjustment to eliminate the sales of unconsolidated entities included in business segment results. Accordingly, Corporate net sales are generally negative. Negative net sales in Corporate for 2013 decreased by $250 million due to 1) the purchase of the balance of our Iberian joint venture (after which this business is consolidated for both segment and consolidated results and the underlying sales no longer need to be eliminated) and 2) smaller adjustments required to eliminate reduced sales of the remaining unconsolidated entities. Corporate net earnings improved $1.6 billion primarily due to reduced net after-tax goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges (which totaled $1.5 billion in the prior year as compared to $290 million in the current period), along with the current year net after-tax holding gain related to the purchase of the balance of our Iberian joint venture, partially offset by the current year charge for the impact of the Venezuela devaluation. Additional discussion of the items impacting net earnings in Corporate are included in the Results of Operations section.In 2012, negative net sales in Corporate decreased by $108 million due to adjustments required to eliminate the lower net sales of unconsolidated entities. Corporate net earnings declined $2.2 billion primarily due to the net after tax goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $1.5 billion, incremental after-tax restructuring charges of $587 million and the impact of lower net discrete tax adjustments in 2012. Additional discussion of the items impacting net earnings in Corporate are included in the Results of Operations section above.Productivity and Cost Savings PlanIn February and November 2012, the Company made announcements related to a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. As part of this plan, the Company expects to incur in excess of $3.5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a five-year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2016). Approximately 55% of the costs have been incurred through the end of fiscal 2013. Savings generated from the restructuring costs are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the corollary benefits achieved, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. Overall, the costs are expected to deliver in excess of $2 billion in before-tax annual savings. The cumulative before-tax savings realized as a result of restructuring costs incurred through 2013 were approximately $940 million.Restructuring accruals of $323 million as of June 30, 2013, are classified as current liabilities. Approximately 86% of the restructuring charges incurred during fiscal 2013 either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. Refer to Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program.The Procter & Gamble Company 37 CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates.Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.Operating Cash FlowFiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012Operating cash flow was $14.9 billion in 2013, a 12% increase from the prior year. Operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, deferred income taxes and gains on sale and purchase of businesses) and a decrease in working capital. Increased accounts receivable used $415 million of cash primarily to fund growth. In addition, accounts receivable days sales outstanding increased two days due to the timing and mix of sales late in the period and foreign exchange impacts. Increased inventory used $225 million of cash to support product initiatives and to build stock to support capacity expansions and manufacturing sourcing changes, partially offset by inventory management improvement efforts. Inventory days on hand increased by one day primarily due to foreign exchange impacts. Increased accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities generated $1.3 billion of cash primarily due to an increase in marketing accruals from increased advertising and other marketing costs.Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011Operating cash flow was $13.3 billion in 2012, in line with the prior year. Operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, deferred income taxes and gains on sale of businesses), partially offset by working capital increases. Increased accounts receivable used $427 million of cash to fund growth. However, accounts receivable days sales outstanding were down two days primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange. Inventory generated $77 million of cash, mainly due to an increase in inventory management improvement efforts, partially offset by inventory to support product initiatives and to build stock to support capacity expansions and manufacturing sourcing changes. Inventory days on hand declined by 10 days primarily due to inventory management improvement efforts and the impact of foreign exchange. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities used $22 million of cash, due primarily to the payment of fines related to violations of the European competition laws. Cash flow from discontinued operations contributed approximately $200 million to operating cash flow.Free Cash Flow. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation. Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012Free cash flow was $10.9 billion in 2013, an increase of 17% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by the increase in operating cash flows. Free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings, was 95% in 2013. Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011Free cash flow was $9.3 billion in 2012, a decrease of 7% versus the prior year. Free cash flow decreased primarily due to higher capital spending to support geographic expansion. Free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings, was 85% in 2012. Investing Cash FlowsFiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012Net investing activities consumed $6.3 billion in cash in 2013 mainly due to capital spending, cash paid for acquisitions and investments in available-for-sale securities, partially offset by asset sales. Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011Net investing activities consumed $1.1 billion in cash in 2012 mainly due to capital spending, partially offset by proceeds from asset sales of $2.9 billion. These proceeds were primarily related to cash received from the sale of our snacks business in 2012. Capital Spending. We manage capital spending to support our business growth plans and have cost controls to deliver our cash generation targets. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost savings, were $4.0 billion in both 2013 and 2012. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points to 4.8% in 2013. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points to 4.7% in 2012.Acquisitions. Acquisitions used $1.1 billion of cash in 2013 primarily for the acquisition of our partner's interest in a joint venture in Iberia. Acquisitions used $134 million of 38 The Procter & Gamble Companycash in 2012 primarily for the acquisition of New Chapter, a vitamins supplement business. Proceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $584 million in cash in 2013 mainly due to the divestitures of our bleach business in Italy and the Braun household appliances business. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $2.9 billion to cash in 2012 mainly due to the sale of our snacks business. Financing Cash FlowsDividend Payments. Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments. Dividends per common share increased 7% to $2.29 per share in 2013. Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $6.5 billion in 2013 and $6.1 billion in 2012. In April 2013, the Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.5620 to $0.6015 per share on Common Stock and Series A and B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock. This represents a 7% increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 57th consecutive year that our dividend has increased. We have paid a dividend in every year since our incorporation in 1890.Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $31.5 billion as of June 30, 2013 and $29.8 billion as of June 30, 2012. Our total debt increased in 2013 mainly due to debt issuances and an increase in commercial paper outstanding, partially offset by bond maturities.Treasury Purchases. Total share repurchases were $6.0 billion in 2013 and $4.0 billion in 2012. LiquidityAt June 30, 2013, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $6.0 billion, largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. Additionally, a portion of our cash is held off-shore by foreign subsidiaries. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs and we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the United States to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future. We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements.On June 30, 2013, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard & Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings are Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard & Poor's), both with a stable outlook.We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $11.0 billion facility split between a $7.0 billion 5-year facility and a $4.0 billion 364-day facility, which expire in August 2018 and August 2014, respectively. The 364-day facility can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in, and in accordance with, the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain largely undrawn for the foreseeable future. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities.Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity. The Procter & Gamble Company 39 Contractual CommitmentsThe following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2013.($ millions)Total Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 YearsRECORDED LIABILITIES Total debt$31,441 $12,393 $6,004 $2,609 $10,435Capital leases31 5 18 8 —Uncertain tax positions(1)46 46 — — —OTHER Interest payments relating to long-term debt8,220 865 1,382 1,169 4,804Operating leases(2)1,512 254 437 302 519Minimum pension funding(3)722 263 459 — —Purchase obligations(4)2,183 1,114 625 210 234TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS44,155 14,940 8,925 4,298 15,992(1) As of June 30, 2013, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $2.0 billion, including $447 million of interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of June 30, 2013, cannot be made.(2) Operating lease obligations are shown net of guaranteed sublease income.(3) Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. These amounts do not include expected future discretionary contributions, including the July 2013 contribution to a foreign pension plan of approximately $1 billion. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2016 are not currently determinable.(4) Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent future purchases in line with expected usage to obtain favorable pricing. Approximately 20% relates to service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include income taxes, certain employee benefits and acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.The Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, the tax effect of 40 The Procter & Gamble Companyexpenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. For additional details on the Company's income taxes, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Employee BenefitsWe sponsor various post-employment benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense, since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPEB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2013, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPEB assets were 7.3% and 8.3%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPEB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $100 million.Since pension and OPEB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans of 4.0% and 4.8%, respectively, represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100-basis point change in the pension discount rate would impact annual after-tax defined benefit pension expense by approximately $160 million. A change in the OPEB discount rate of 100 basis points would impact annual after-tax OPEB expense by approximately $65 million. For additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangible AssetsOur Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the transaction. In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill.Significant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations The Procter & Gamble Company 41 and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain.We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants, and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, economic barriers to entry, a brand's relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are primarily based on these same factors. All of our acquired technology and customer-related intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives. The costs of determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. We test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the book values of each asset to the estimated fair value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment test is performed and indefinite-lived brands may be adjusted to a determinable life. With the exception of our Appliances and Salon Professional businesses, all of our reporting units have fair values that significantly exceed recorded values. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect the financial statements in any given year. The recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets from recently impaired businesses and recently acquired businesses are derived from more recent business operating plans and macroeconomic environmental conditions and therefore are more susceptible to an adverse change that could require an impairment charge.For example, the Gillette intangible and goodwill amounts represent values as of a more recent acquisition date and, as such, the amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate. Gillette indefinite-lived intangible assets represent approximately 89% of the $26.8 billion of indefinite-lived intangible assets at June 30, 2013. Goodwill allocated to stand-alone reporting units consisting primarily of businesses purchased as part of the Gillette acquisition represents 42% of the $55.2 billion of goodwill at June 30, 2013. This includes the Shave Care and Appliances businesses, which are components of the Grooming segment, and the Batteries business, which is part of the Fabric Care and Home Care segment.The results of our impairment testing during fiscal 2012 indicated that the estimated fair values of our Appliances and Salon Professional reporting units were less than their respective carrying amounts. Therefore, we recorded a non-cash before- and after-tax impairment charge of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2012. Additionally, our impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets during fiscal 2012 indicated a decline in the fair value of our Koleston Perfect and Wella trade name intangible assets below their respective carrying values. This resulted in a non-cash, before-tax impairment charge of $246 million ($173 million after-tax) to reduce the carrying amounts of these assets to their estimated fair values. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the estimated fair value of our Appliances reporting units declined further, below the carrying amount resulting from the fiscal 2012 impairment. Therefore, we recorded an additional non-cash before and after-tax impairment charge of $259 million in fiscal 2013. Additionally, our fourth quarter 2013 impairment testing for Appliances indicated a decline in the fair value of our Braun trade name intangible asset below its carrying value. This resulted in a non-cash, before-tax impairment charge of $49 million ($31 million after-tax) to reduce the carrying amount of this asset to its estimated fair value.42 The Procter & Gamble CompanyThe Appliances business was acquired as part of the Gillette acquisition in 2005 and the Salon Professional business consists primarily of operations acquired in the Wella acquisition in 2004. Both businesses are stand-alone reporting units. These businesses represent some of our more discretionary consumer spending categories. Because of this, their operations and underlying fair values were disproportionately impacted by the economic downturn that began in fiscal 2009, which led to a reduction in home and personal grooming appliance purchases and in visits to hair salons that drove the fiscal 2012 impairment. The additional impairment of the Appliances business in fiscal 2013 was due to the devaluation of currency in Japan, a key country that generates a significant portion of the earnings of the Appliances business, relative to the currencies in which the underlying net assets are recorded. As of June 30, 2013, the Appliances business has remaining goodwill of $313 million, while the Salon Professional business has remaining goodwill of $424 million. As a result of the impairments, the estimated fair value of our Appliances business approximates its carrying value, while the estimated fair value of the Salon Professional business now slightly exceeds its carrying value. Our fiscal 2013 valuations of the Appliances and Salon Professional businesses has them returning to sales and earnings growth rates consistent with our long-term business plans. Failure to achieve these business plans or a further deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions could result in a valuation that would trigger an additional impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses.New Accounting PronouncementsDuring fiscal 2013, the Company adopted ASU 2011-05, ""Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) - Presentation of Comprehensive Income"" (ASU 2011-05), and ASU 2013-02, “Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) - Reporting of Amounts Reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” (ASU 2013-02). This guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders' equity and requires entities to present the components of net earnings and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. We chose to present net earnings and other comprehensive income in two separate but consecutive statements. This guidance also requires entities to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income. We chose to present the requirements in the notes to the financial statements (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.OTHER INFORMATIONHedging and Derivative Financial InstrumentsAs a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. Except within financing operations, we leverage the Company's broadly diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes a detailed discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments.Derivative positions can be monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the CorporateManager™ value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics™ dataset as of June 30, 2013. In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics™, a reasonable proxy is included.Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term.Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments.Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June 30, 2013, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on The Procter & Gamble Company 43 historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements.Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with our financing operations, we primarily use forward contracts with maturities of less than 18 months. In addition, we enter into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions.Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2013, we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements.Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. In addition to fixed price contracts, we may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures.As of and during the year ended June 30, 2013, we did not have material commodity hedging activity.Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAPOur discussion of financial results includes several ""non-GAAP"" financial measures. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MD&A, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion. These measures include:Organic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Organic sales is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. The following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth: Year ended June 30, 2013Net SalesGrowth ForeignExchangeImpact Acquisition/DivestitureImpact* OrganicSalesGrowthBeauty-2 % 2% 1 % 1%Grooming-4 % 4% 2 % 2%Health Care3 % 3% -1 % 5%Fabric Care and Home Care1 % 2% 0 % 3%Baby Care and Family Care2 % 2% 0 % 4%TOTAL COMPANY1 % 2% 0 % 3% Year ended June 30, 2012Net SalesGrowth ForeignExchangeImpact Acquisition/DivestitureImpact* OrganicSalesGrowthBeauty2 % 0% 0 % 2%Grooming1 % 1% 0 % 2%Health Care3 % 0% -1 % 2%Fabric Care and Home Care3 % 0% 0 % 3%Baby Care and Family Care6 % 0% 0 % 6%TOTAL COMPANY3 % 0% 0 % 3%* Acquisition/Divestiture Impact includes rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales.Core EPS. This is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. This includes a charge in 2013 for the balance sheet impact from the devaluation of the official foreign exchange rate in Venezuela, a holding gain in 2013 on the purchase of the balance of our Iberian joint venture, impairment charges in 2013 and 2012 for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, charges in 2013 and 2012 related to incremental restructuring due to increased focus on productivity and cost savings, a significant benefit in 2011 from the settlement of U.S. tax litigation primarily related to the valuation of technology donations and charges in 2013, 2012 and 2011 related to pending European legal matters. We do not view these items to be part of our sustainable results. We believe the Core EPS measure provides an important perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year earnings per share growth. Core EPS is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.44 The Procter & Gamble CompanyThe table below provides a reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to Core EPS:Years ended June 302013 2012 2011Diluted net earnings per share - continuing operations$3.86 $3.12 $3.85Venezuela balance sheet devaluation Impacts0.08 — —Gain on purchase of balance of Iberian JV(0.21) Impairment charges0.10 0.51 —Incremental restructuring charges0.18 0.20 —Settlement from U.S. tax litigation— — (0.08)Charges for pending European legal matters0.05 0.03 0.10Rounding(0.01) (0.01) —CORE EPS4.05 3.85 3.87Core EPS Growth5% (1)% Note - All reconciling items are presented net of tax. Tax effects are calculated consistent with the nature of the underlying transaction. The significant adjustment to an income tax reserve was tax expense. There was no tax impact on EPS due to the charges for pending European legal matters.Free Cash Flow. Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.Free Cash Flow Productivity. Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. Free cash flow productivity is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow productivity ($ millions): OperatingCash FlowCapitalSpendingFreeCash FlowNetEarningsFreeCash FlowProductivity2013$14,873$(4,008)$10,865$11,40295%201213,284(3,964)9,32010,90485%201113,330(3,306)10,02411,92784% Item 7A.

Forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this report and we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise.The following Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended to provide the reader with an understanding of P&G's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. MD&A is organized in the following sections:•Overview•Summary of 2014 Results •Economic Conditions, Challenges and Risks•Results of Operations•Segment Results•Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity•Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates•Other Information Throughout MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), free cash flow and free cash flow productivity. Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain specified charges and gains. Free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending. Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. The explanation at the end of MD&A provides more details on the use and derivation of these measures.Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category and are measured on an annual basis versus the prior 12 month period. References to competitive activity include promotional and product initiatives from our competitors.OVERVIEWP&G is a global leader in fast moving consumer goods focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, salons, distributors, e-commerce and high-frequency stores. We continue to expand our presence in other channels, including perfumeries and pharmacies. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.The Procter & Gamble Company 23ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTUREOur organizational structure is comprised of Global Business Units (GBUs), Global Operations, Global Business Services (GBS) and Corporate Functions (CF).Global Business UnitsUnder U.S. GAAP, the GBUs are aggregated into five reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby, Feminine and Family Care. The GBUs are responsible for developing overall brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovations and marketing plans. The following provides additional detail on our reportable segments and the key product categories and brand composition within each segment.Reportable Segment% ofNet Sales*% of NetEarnings*GBUs (Categories)Billion Dollar BrandsBeauty24%23%Beauty Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Cosmetics, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); Hair Care and Color; Prestige; Salon ProfessionalHead & Shoulders, Olay, Pantene, SK-II, WellaGrooming10%17%Shave Care (Electronic Hair Removal, Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care)Fusion, Gillette, Mach3, PrestobarbaHealth Care9%9%Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care); Oral Care (Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care)Crest, Oral-B, VicksFabric Care and Home Care32%26%Fabric Care (Laundry Additives, Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care); Personal Power (Batteries)Ariel, Dawn, Downy, Duracell, Febreze, Gain, TideBaby, Feminine and Family Care25%25%Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper)Always, Bounty, Charmin, Pampers* Percent of net sales and net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2014 (excluding results held in Corporate).Recent Developments: On July 31, 2014 the Company completed the divestiture of its pet care operations in North America, Latin America, and other selected countries to Mars, Incorporated (Mars) for $2.9 billion in an all-cash transaction. The gain or loss related to this transaction is not expected to be material and will be included in fiscal 2015 results. The European Union countries are not included in the agreement with Mars. The Company is pursuing alternate plans to sell its Pet Care business in these markets. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets, the results of our Pet Care business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations and from segment results for all periods presented. Beauty: We are a global market leader in the beauty category. Most of the beauty markets in which we compete are highly fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. We compete in beauty care, hair care and color and prestige. In beauty care, we offer a wide variety of products, ranging from deodorants to cosmetics to skin care, such as our Olay brand, which is the top facial skin care brand in the world with over 8% global market share. In hair care and color, we compete in both the retail and salon professional channels. We are the global market leader in the retail hair care and color market with over 20% global market share primarily behind our Pantene and Head & Shoulders brands. In the prestige channel, we compete primarily with our prestige fragrances behind Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci and Hugo Boss fragrance brands and the SK-II brand.Grooming: We are the global market leader in the blades and razors market globally. Our global blades and razors market share is approximately 70%, primarily behind the Gillette franchise including Fusion, Mach3, Prestobarba and Venus. Our electronic hair removal devices, such as electric razors and epilators, are sold under the Braun brand in a number of markets around the world where we compete against both global and regional competitors. We hold over 20% of the male shavers market and over 40% of the female epilators market.Health Care: We compete in oral care and personal health care. In oral care, there are several global competitors in the market and we have the number two market share position with approximately 20% global market share. In personal health care, we are a top ten competitor in a large, highly fragmented industry behind respiratory treatments (Vicks brand) and nonprescription heartburn medications (Prilosec OTC brand). Nearly all of our sales outside the U.S in personal health are generated through the PGT Healthcare partnership with Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd. 24 The Procter & Gamble CompanyFabric Care and Home Care: This segment is comprised of a variety of fabric care products, including: laundry detergents, additives and fabric enhancers; home care products, including dishwashing liquids and detergents, surface cleaners and air fresheners; and batteries. In fabric care, we generally have the number one or number two share position in the markets in which we compete and are the global market leader, with over 25% global market share, primarily behind our Tide, Ariel and Downy brands. Our global home care market share is approximately 20% across the categories in which we compete. In batteries, we have over 25% global battery market share, behind our Duracell brand. Baby, Feminine and Family Care: In baby care, we compete mainly in diapers, pants and baby wipes, with over 30% global market share. We are the number one or number two baby care competitor in most of the key markets in which we compete, primarily behind Pampers, the Company's largest brand, with annual net sales of more than $10 billion. We are the global market leader in the feminine care category with over 30% global market share, primarily behind Always. Our family care business is predominantly a North American business comprised largely of the Bounty paper towel and Charmin toilet paper brands. U.S. market shares are approximately 45% for Bounty and over 25% for Charmin.Global OperationsGlobal Operations is comprised of our Sales and Market Operations (SMO), which is responsible for developing and executing go-to-market plans at the local level. The SMO includes dedicated retail customer, trade channel and country-specific teams. Through June 30, 2014, it was organized along five geographic regions: North America, Western Europe, Central & Eastern Europe/Middle East/Africa (CEEMEA), Latin America and Asia, which is comprised of Japan, Greater China and ASEAN/Australia/India/Korea (AAIK). Throughout MD&A, we reference business results in developing markets, which we define as the aggregate of CEEMEA, Latin America, AAIK and Greater China, and developed markets, which are comprised of North America, Western Europe and Japan. Effective July 1, 2014, our SMO reorganized under five revised regions, comprised of North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia, and India/Middle East/Africa (IMEA).Global Business ServicesGBS provides technology, processes and standard data tools to enable the GBUs and the SMO to better understand the business and better serve consumers and customers. The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class solutions at a low cost and with minimal capital investment.Corporate FunctionsCF provides Company-level strategy and portfolio analysis, corporate accounting, treasury, tax, external relations, governance, human resources and legal, as well as other centralized functional support.STRATEGIC FOCUSWe are focused on strategies that we believe are right for the long-term health of the Company with the objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. We are focusing our resources on our leading, most profitable categories and markets: •Strengthening core categories, such as baby care and fabric care, and core markets, such as the U.S., to grow these businesses.•Investing in developing markets on the categories and countries with the largest size of prize and highest likelihood of winning.•Narrowing and refocusing the Company's portfolio to compete in categories and brands that are structurally attractive and that play to P&G strengths and looking at alternatives to partner, divest or discontinue the balance. This will enable us to allocate resources to leading brands - marketed in the right set of countries, channels, and customers - where the size of the prize and probability of winning is highest.Innovation has always been - and continues to be - P&G's lifeblood. To consistently win with consumers around the world across price tiers and preferences and to consistently win versus our best competitors, each P&G product category needs a full portfolio of innovation, including a mix of commercial programs, product improvements and game-changing innovations.Productivity is a core strength for P&G, which creates flexibility to fund our growth efforts and deliver our financial commitments. We have taken significant steps to accelerate productivity and savings across all elements of costs, including cost of goods sold, marketing expense and non-manufacturing overhead.Finally, we are focused on improving execution and operating discipline in everything we do. Operating discipline and execution have always been - and must continue to be - core capabilities and competitive advantages for P&G. At current market growth rates, the Company expects the consistent delivery of the following annual financial targets will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive peer group:•Organic sales growth modestly above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete;•Core EPS growth of high single digits; and•Free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater.The Procter & Gamble Company 25SUMMARY OF 2014 RESULTSAmounts in millions, except per share amounts2014 Change vs. Prior Year 2013 Change vs. Prior Year 2012Net sales$83,062 1% $82,581 1% $82,006Operating income15,288 7% 14,330 10% 13,035Net earnings from continuing operations11,707 4% 11,301 24% 9,150Net earnings from discontinued operations78 (23)% 101 (94)% 1,754Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble11,643 3% 11,312 5% 10,756Diluted net earnings per common share4.01 4% 3.86 5% 3.66Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations3.98 4% 3.83 25% 3.06Core earnings per common share4.22 5% 4.02 6% 3.79•Net sales increased 1% to $83.1 billion including a negative 2% impact from foreign exchange.◦Organic sales increased 3%.◦Unit volume increased 3%.

All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are ""forward-looking statements"" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors in this 10-K.Ability to Achieve Business Plans. We are a consumer products company and rely on continued demand for our brands and products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers and retail trade customers. Our continued success is dependent on innovation with respect to both products and operations and on the continued positive reputations of our brands. This means we must be able to obtain and maintain patents and trademarks and respond to technological advances and patents granted to competition. Our success is also dependent on effective sales, advertising and marketing programs in a more fast-paced and rapidly changing environment. Our ability to innovate and execute in these areas will determine the extent to which we are able to grow existing net sales and volume profitably, especially with respect to the product categories and geographic markets (including developing markets) in which we have chosen to focus. There are high levels of competitive activity in the markets in which we operate. To address these challenges, we must respond to competitive factors, including pricing, promotional incentives, trade terms and product initiatives. We must manage each of these factors, as well as maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, in order to effectively compete and achieve our business plans. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model involves a certain level of ongoing acquisition, divestiture and joint venture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against base business objectives. Daily conduct of our business also depends on our ability to maintain key information technology systems, including systems operated by third-party suppliers and to maintain security over our data.26 The Procter & Gamble CompanyCost Pressures. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, labor costs, foreign exchange and interest rates. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects, sourcing decisions and certain hedging transactions, as well as ongoing productivity improvements. We also must manage our debt and currency exposure, especially in certain countries with currency exchange controls, such as Venezuela, China, India, Egypt and Argentina. We need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including sole supplier and manufacturing plant arrangements, and successfully manage any disruptions at Company manufacturing sites. We must implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including our established outsourcing relationships and those related to general overhead and workforce optimization. Successfully managing these changes, including identifying, developing and retaining key employees, is critical to our success.Global Economic Conditions. Demand for our products has a correlation to global macroeconomic factors. The current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic. Economic changes, terrorist activity, political unrest and natural disasters may result in business interruption, inflation, deflation or decreased demand for our products. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty, especially in our significant geographic markets, due to terrorist and other hostile activities or natural disasters. We could also be negatively impacted by a global, regional or national economic crisis, including sovereign risk in the event of a deterioration in the credit worthiness of, or a default by local governments, resulting in a disruption of credit markets. Such events could negatively impact our ability to collect receipts due from governments, including refunds of value added taxes, create significant credit risks relative to our local customers and depository institutions and/or negatively impact our overall liquidity. Additionally, changes in exchange controls and other limits could impact our ability to repatriate earnings from overseas.Regulatory Environment. Changes in laws, regulations and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business. This includes changes in environmental, competitive and product-related laws, as well as changes in accounting standards and tax laws or the enforcement thereof. Our ability to manage regulatory, tax and legal matters (including, but not limited to, product liability, patent and other intellectual property matters) and to resolve pending legal matters within current estimates may impact our results.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A), other non-operating items and income taxes. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, the level of initiatives and other activities by competitors, geographic expansion and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as pricing actions (which can also indirectly impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the U.S.Most of our cost of products sold and SG&A are to some extent variable in nature. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and to a lesser extent scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary drivers of SG&A are marketing-related costs and overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we do achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. Overhead costs are also variable in nature, but on a relative basis, less so than marketing costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth. Accordingly, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs. The Company is in the midst of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overhead expenses. The plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. The Company expects to incur in excess of $4.5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a five-year period (fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2016) as part of this plan. Overall, the costs and other non-manufacturing enrollment reductions are expected to deliver in excess of $2.8 billion in annual gross before-tax savings (see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).Net SalesFiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013Net sales increased 1% to $83.1 billion in 2014 on a 3% increase in unit volume versus the prior year period. Fabric Care and Home Care along with Baby, Feminine and Family Care volume grew mid-single digits. Grooming and Health Care volume grew low single digits. Beauty volume was unchanged. Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and grew mid-single digits in developing regions. The Procter & Gamble Company 27Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%. Organic sales grew 3% driven by the unit volume increase. A 1% favorable impact from higher pricing was offset by a 1% impact from unfavorable geographic and product mix due to higher relative growth of developing regions, which have lower than average selling prices, and of lower priced product categories such as Fabric Care and Baby Care.Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012Net sales increased 1% to $82.6 billion in 2013 on a 2% increase in unit volume. Volume in Health Care and Baby, Feminine and Family Care grew mid-single digits. Volume in Fabric Care and Home Care grew low single digits. Beauty volume was in line with the prior year. Grooming volume decreased low single digits. Volume grew low single digits in both developed and developing regions. The impact of overall global market growth was partially offset by market share declines in certain categories. Price increases added 1% to net sales, driven by price increases across all business segments, primarily executed in prior periods to offset cost increases and devaluing developing market currencies. Foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%. Organic sales growth was 3% driven by both volume and price increases.Operating CostsComparisons as a percentage of net sales; Years ended June 302014 Basis PointChange 2013 Basis PointChange 2012Gross margin48.9% (100) 49.9% 40 49.5%Selling, general and administrative expense30.5% (170) 32.2% 50 31.7%Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges—% (40) 0.4% (150) 1.9%Operating margin18.4% 100 17.4% 150 15.9%Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes17.9% 10 17.8% 250 15.3%Net earnings from continuing operations14.1% 40 13.7% 250 11.2%Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble14.0% 30 13.7% 60 13.1%Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013Gross margin contracted 100 basis points to 48.9% of net sales in 2014. The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by a 150 basis point impact from unfavorable geographic and product mix, a 50 basis point impact from higher commodity costs, and a 90 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings of 190 basis points and a 40 basis point benefit from higher pricing. The unfavorable geographic and product mix was caused by disproportionate growth in developing regions, and the Fabric Care and Home Care and Baby, Feminine and Family Care segments, which have lower gross margins than the Company average. Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 5% to $25.3 billion in 2014 due to a reduction in marketing spending, overhead expense and restructuring costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 170 basis points to 30.5%. Lower restructuring spending drove 30 basis points of the decline. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 80 basis points primarily due to lower spending behind a focus on more efficient marketing support and scale benefits from increased net sales. Overhead spending decreased 50 basis points from productivity savings of 40 basis points and scale benefits from increased net sales. The 2014 impact from foreign currency policy changes in Venezuela was comparable to the prior year devaluation impact. Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012Gross margin expanded 40 basis points in 2013 to 49.9% of net sales, driven by higher pricing and manufacturing cost savings, partially offset by negative mix and higher commodity costs. Gross margin was positively impacted by 70 basis points from higher pricing and approximately 160 basis points from manufacturing cost savings. Gross margin was negatively impacted by 160 basis points from negative geographic and product mix behind disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier products, both of which have lower gross margins than the Company average. Gross margin was also reduced by capacity investments and to a lesser extent by foreign exchange impacts and higher commodity costs. Total SG&A increased 2% to $26.6 billion in 2013, driven by a charge for the balance sheet impact from the devaluation of the official foreign exchange rate in Venezuela and an increase in marketing spending, partially offset by reduced overhead costs as a result of the productivity and cost savings plan. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 50 basis points to 32.2% largely due to a 40 basis point impact from the Venezuela devaluation charge and a 10 basis point increase in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales declined 20 basis points, as a 70 basis point benefit from our productivity and cost savings plan and 20 basis points of lower restructuring costs were largely offset by the impact of foreign exchange. This was due to a higher 28 The Procter & Gamble Companyportion of SG&A spending in strengthening currencies as compared to net sales, higher employee wages and benefit costs and increased merchandising investments.In fiscal 2013 we incurred impairment charges of $308 million ($290 million after-tax) related to the carrying value of goodwill in our Appliances business and the related Braun trade name intangible asset. In fiscal 2012 we incurred impairment charges of $1.6 billion ($1.5 billion after-tax) related to the carrying values of goodwill in our Appliances and Salon Professional businesses and our Koleston Perfect and Wella indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are part of our Salon Professional business. See Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) and Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details, including factors leading to the impairment charges. Since goodwill is included in Corporate for internal management and segment reporting, the goodwill impairment charges are included in the Corporate segment. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments are also included in the Corporate segment for management and segment reporting. Non-Operating ItemsFiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013Interest expense increased 6% in 2014 to $709 million, primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding. Interest income was $100 million in 2014, an increase of $13 million versus the prior year due to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. Other non-operating income, net, primarily includes divestiture gains and investment income. Other non-operating income decreased $736 million to $206 million, primarily due to acquisition and divestiture impacts. In 2014, we had approximately $150 million in divestiture gains, primarily related to the sale of our bleach businesses in CEEMEA and Latin America, our Pert hair care business in Latin America and MDVIP. The prior year acquisition and divestiture activities included a $631 million holding gain resulting from P&G's purchase of the balance of its Baby Care and Feminine Care joint venture in Iberia and an approximate $250 million gain from the divestiture of our Italy bleach business.Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012Interest expense decreased 13% in 2013 to $667 million, due to lower interest rates on floating-rate debt. Interest income increased 13% in 2013 to $87 million, due to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and debt securities. Other non-operating income increased $757 million to $942 million in 2013 mainly due to net acquisition and divestiture activities. The $631 million holding gain resulting from the purchase of the balance of P&G's Baby Care and Feminine Care joint venture in Iberia and the gain of approximately $250 million from the sale of our Italian bleach business, both in fiscal 2013, were partially offset by a $130 million divestiture gain from the PUR water filtration business in 2012. Income TaxesFiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 170 basis points to 21.4% in 2014. The primary driver of this rate decline was approximately 320 basis points from the favorable geographic mix of earnings and approximately 60 basis points due to the non-deductibility of the prior year impairment charges related to our Appliances business. These impacts were partially offset by a 50 basis point increase due to the Venezuela currency policy changes and devaluation discussed below (which decreased the prior year rate 20 basis points and increased the current year rate by 30 basis points), a 110 basis point increase due to the tax impacts of acquisition and divestiture activities (the gains from the purchase of the balance of the Baby Care and Feminine Care joint venture in Iberia and the sale of our Italy bleach business in the prior year), and a 30 basis point increase is due to the net impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions. The net benefit on the current year was $228 million, or 150 basis points, versus 180 basis points of net benefit in the prior year.Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 390 basis points to 23.1% in 2013. The primary drivers of this rate decline were approximately 210 basis points due to the non-deductibility of impairment charges related to our Appliances and Salon Professional businesses, which were higher in the base period versus the current year, approximately 100 basis points due to the tax impacts from acquisition and divestiture activity (primarily the non-taxable gain on the purchase of the balance of the Baby Care and Feminine Care joint venture in Iberia), approximately 20 basis points from the impact of the Venezuela currency devaluation, and approximately 50 basis points due to the net impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions. The 2013 net benefit was $275 million, or 180 basis points, versus a net benefit of 130 basis points in 2012.Net EarningsFiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013Net earnings from continuing operations increased $406 million or 4% to $11.7 billion in 2014 due to the increase in sales and a 40-basis point expansion in net earnings margin. The increase in net earnings margin was primarily driven by the decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales and the lower tax rate, partially offset by the gross margin contraction and the acquisition and divestiture-driven net reduction in other non-operating income, net. Net earnings from discontinued operations decreased $23 million in 2014 due to ongoing impacts of prior year product recalls in Pet Care. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $331 million, or 3% to $11.6 billion.The Procter & Gamble Company 29Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 4% to $3.98 primarily due to the increase in net earnings. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations was $0.03 due to the earnings of the Pet Care business. Diluted net earnings per share increased 4% to $4.01.Core EPS increased 5% to $4.22 primarily due to increased net sales, a 40 basis point net earnings margin expansion and the reduction in shares outstanding. Core EPS represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the current and prior year charge for the balance sheet impacts from foreign exchange policy changes and the devaluation of the foreign exchange rates in Venezuela (see below), the prior year holding gain on the purchase of the balance of our Iberian joint venture, impairments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the prior year and charges in both years for European legal matters and incremental restructuring related to our productivity and cost savings plan.Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012Net earnings from continuing operations increased $2.2 billion or 24% to $11.3 billion in 2013. The combination of the net year-over-year impact of acquisition and divestiture gains and the net year-over-year decline in impairment charges drove $1.9 billion of the increase. Earnings also increased due to the increase in net sales and the 40 basis point gross margin expansion in 2013. Net earnings from discontinued operations decreased $1.7 billion in 2013 due to the gain on the divestiture of the Snacks business and the earnings from the Snacks business prior to the divestiture in the prior year. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $556 million, or 5% to $11.3 billion.Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 25% to $3.83 in 2013 due to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in shares outstanding. The number of shares outstanding decreased due to $6.0 billion of treasury share repurchases under our publicly announced share repurchase program, partially offset by shares issued under share-based compensation plans. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations was $0.03 due to the earnings of the Pet Care business. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations in 2012 was $0.60 primarily due to the gain on the divestiture of the Snacks business and earnings of the Snacks business prior to divestiture. Diluted net earnings per share increased 5% to $3.86.Core EPS increased 6% to $4.02 in 2013 primarily due to increased net sales, gross margin expansion and the reduction in shares outstanding. Core EPS represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the 2013 charge for the balance sheet impact from the devaluation of the official foreign exchange rate in Venezuela, the 2013 holding gain on the purchase of the balance of our Iberian joint venture and charges in both years for European legal matters, incremental restructuring related to our productivity and cost savings plan and impairments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.Venezuela Currency ImpactsVenezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. As a result, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Venezuela. Any currency remeasurement adjustments for non-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by these subsidiaries and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings. For the current fiscal year, Venezuela represented approximately 1% of the Company’s consolidated net sales and operating profit excluding the impact of the remeasurement charge discussed below.Through December 31, 2013, the Venezuelan government had established one official exchange rate for qualifying dividends and imported goods and services. Transactions at the official exchange rate are subject to approval by CENCOEX (National Center for External Commerce), previously CADIVI (Foreign Exchange Administrative Commission). Effective February 9, 2013 the Venezuelan government devalued its currency from 4.3 to 6.3 Venezuelan bolivares fuerte (VEF) per dollar. The remeasurement of our local balance sheets to reflect this devaluation in the fiscal year ended 2013 resulted in an after tax charge of $236 million ($0.08 per share). In addition to the preferential CENCOEX exchange rate, there are and have been parallel exchange markets controlled by the Central Bank of Venezuela as the only legal intermediary to execute foreign exchange transactions outside of CENCOEX. Through December 31, 2013, various regulations and a limited notional amount of transactions that ran through these programs essentially eliminated the Company's ability to access any foreign exchange rate other than the preferential rate to pay for imported goods and/or manage our local monetary asset balances. Accordingly, all of our net monetary assets were measured at the preferential 6.3 VEF per dollar exchange rate through December 31, 2013. In addition, through December 31, 2013, our results in Venezuela were reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements at the official CADIVI rate, which was the rate we expected to be applicable to dividend repatriations. On January 24, 2014, the government made a number of announcements affecting currency exchange rate and other controls. The preferential CENCOEX exchange rate remains at 6.3 VEF per dollar. In addition, while there is considerable uncertainty as to the nature of transactions that will flow through CENCOEX and how CENCOEX will operate in the future, the Company believes that a significant portion of its imports will continue to qualify for the preferential rate. However, the importation of certain finished goods and raw materials for some product categories, along with the payment of dividends and 30 The Procter & Gamble Companyroyalties, will be executed under the SICAD (Complementary System for Foreign Exchange Administration) program. SICAD is an auction-based exchange program. The Company expects to be able to access the SICAD program for dividends and other transactions. The rate available through SICAD was 11.7 VEF per dollar in January 2014, and was 10.6 VEF per dollar at June 30, 2014. The Company incurred an after tax charge of $275 million ($0.09 per share) in January 2014 to remeasure certain portions of our local Venezuela balance sheets not qualifying for the preferential CENCOEX rate to the initial SICAD exchange rate. In late March 2014, the government introduced a third exchange mechanism, referred to as SICAD II, which is also an auction-based program currently trading at approximately 50.0 VEF per dollar. The Company does not expect to access SICAD II. Accordingly, the underlying SICAD II exchange rates have not been utilized for purposes of remeasuring or translating our Venezuela results. As of June 30, 2014, the Company had net monetary assets denominated in local currency of approximately $1.0 billion. Approximately $670 million of that amount is expected to be utilized to satisfy liabilities for past imports that were approved under CENCOEX and are measured at the preferential 6.3 VEF per dollar rate. The remaining balance has been measured at the SICAD rate. Local currency net monetary balances increased approximately $110 million versus June 30, 2013 as increases due to earnings in Venezuela, the timing of CENCOEX payments and an increase in the net amount of indirect value added taxes (VAT) receivable from the government from goods receipts and shipments, was partially offset by the remeasurement of balances from the preferential CENCOEX rate to the SICAD rate. Other controls imposed by the Venezuelan government include import authorization controls, currency exchange and payment controls, price controls and recently enacted profit margin controls. The ongoing impact of the recent announcements and our ability to restore net sales and profit to levels achieved prior to the recent devaluations will be impacted by several factors. These include our ability to mitigate the effect of the price and profit margin controls, any potential future devaluation of the preferential CENCOEX exchange rate, any significant change in the auction exchange rates or liquidity in the SICAD program, any migration of additional product categories from the CENCOEX to the SICAD rates, any Company actions to access the SICAD II market, any further Venezuelan government price or exchange controls, economic conditions and the availability of raw materials and utilities. In addition, depending on the future availability of U.S. dollars at the preferential rate, our local U.S. dollar needs, our overall repatriation plans, including our ability to obtain government approval for the payment of dividends, which has been limited in recent years, the creditworthiness of the local depository institutions and other creditors and our ability to collect amounts due from customers and the government, including VAT receivables, we may have exposure for our local monetary assets. SEGMENT RESULTSSegment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. The results of these reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs such as interest expense, investing activities and certain restructuring and asset impairment costs. These costs are reported in our Corporate segment and are included as part of our Corporate segment discussion. Additionally, as described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we apply blended statutory tax rates in the segments. Eliminations to adjust segment results to arrive at our effective tax rate are included in Corporate. We previously had a difference in the treatment of certain unconsolidated investees. Certain unconsolidated investees that are managed as integral parts of our businesses were reflected as consolidated subsidiaries for management reporting and in segment results, with full recognition of the individual income statement line items through before-tax earnings. Eliminations to adjust these line items to U.S. GAAP were included in Corporate. In determining after-tax earnings for the businesses, we eliminated the share of earnings applicable to other ownership interests, in a manner similar to noncontrolling interest, and applied statutory tax rates. During the final quarter of fiscal 2014, we changed our management accounting for unconsolidated investees. Pursuant to this change, segment results no longer include full recognition of the individual income statement line items of unconsolidated investees and eliminations of such amounts are no longer included in Corporate. All periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. All references to net earnings throughout the discussion of segment results refer to net earnings from continuing operations.The Procter & Gamble Company 31Net Sales Change Drivers (2014 vs. 2013) Volume withAcquisitions& Divestitures VolumeExcludingAcquisitions& Divestitures ForeignExchange Price Mix Other Net SalesGrowthBeauty0% 0% -2% 0% 0% 0% -2%Grooming1% 1% -3% 4% -2% 0% 0%Health Care2% 2% -1% 1% -1% 0% 1%Fabric Care and Home Care5% 5% -3% 0% -1% 0% 1%Baby, Feminine and Family Care4% 3% -3% 1% 0% 0% 2%TOTAL COMPANY3% 3% -2% 1% -1% 0% 1% Net Sales Change Drivers (2013 vs. 2012) Volume withAcquisitions& Divestitures VolumeExcludingAcquisitions& Divestitures ForeignExchange Price Mix Other Net SalesGrowthBeauty0% 0% -2% 2% -1% -1% -2%Grooming-1% 0% -4% 2% 0% -1% -4%Health Care5% 4% -3% 1% 2% 1% 6%Fabric Care and Home Care3% 3% -3% 1% 0% 0% 1%Baby, Feminine and Family Care5% 3% -2% 2% 0% -1% 4%TOTAL COMPANY2% 2% -2% 1% 0% 0% 1%Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied.

Global market share of the beauty care category decreased nearly half a point. Volume in Salon Professional decreased mid-single digits due to competitive activity and European market contraction. Volume in Prestige decreased low single digits due to minor brand divestitures. Net earnings increased 11% to $2.7 billion due to a 160 basis point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to a decrease in SG&A and a gain on a minor brand divestiture (Pert in Latin America), partially offset by gross margin contraction. SG&A decreased primarily due to a reduction in marketing spending resulting from optimization efforts. Gross margin decreased slightly due to the impact of foreign exchange and negative geographic and product mix, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings. Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012Beauty net sales decreased 2% to $20.0 billion in 2013 on unit volume that was in line with the prior year period. Organic sales increased 1%. Price increases contributed 2% to net sales growth.

Corporate net earnings improved by $191 million in 2014 primarily due to reduced net after-tax goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges (which totaled $290 million in the prior year but were zero in the current period), lower current year restructuring and overhead spending and lower overall Company effective tax rate, partially offset by the holding gain in the prior year from the buyout of our Iberian joint venture partner. Additional discussion of the items impacting net earnings in Corporate are included in the Results of Operations section.In 2013, net sales in Corporate decreased by $258 million due to a reduction in sales from P&G Chemicals as a result of lower commodity prices. Corporate net earnings improved $1.6 billion primarily due to reduced net after-tax goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges (which totaled $1.5 billion in the prior year as compared to $290 million in the current period), along with the 2013 net after-tax holding gain related to the purchase of the balance of our Iberian joint venture, partially offset by the 2013 charge for the impact of the Venezuela devaluation. Additional discussion of the items impacting net earnings in Corporate are included in the Results of Operations section above.Productivity and Cost Savings PlanIn 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. As part of this plan, the Company expects to incur in excess of $4.5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a five-year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2016). Approximately 62% of the costs have been incurred through the end of fiscal 2014. Savings generated from the restructuring costs are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the corollary benefits achieved (e.g., enrollment reduction achieved via normal attrition), the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. Overall, the costs and other non-manufacturing enrollment reductions are expected to deliver in excess of $2.8 billion in annual gross savings (before-tax). The cumulative before-tax savings realized through 2014 were approximately $1.4 billion. Restructuring accruals of $381 million as of June 30, 2014, are classified as current liabilities. Approximately 75% of the restructuring charges incurred during fiscal 2014 either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. Refer to Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program.CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates.Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.Operating Cash FlowFiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013Operating cash flow was $14.0 billion in 2014, a 6% decrease from the prior year, which was primarily driven by a $1 billion discretionary contribution into a foreign pension plan. Operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes and gains on sale and purchase of businesses) partially offset by the impact of other operating assets and liabilities. Working capital changes did not have a significant impact on operating cash flow in 2014. Reduced accounts receivable generated $87 million of cash primarily due to improved collection results, which, along with the timing and mix of sales late in the period, drove a 1 day decrease in accounts receivable days sales outstanding. Inventory changes did not significantly impact operating cash flow as inventory management improvement efforts offset inventory needed to support product initiatives and build stock to support capacity expansions and manufacturing sourcing changes. Inventory days on hand decreased by 3 days primarily due to inventory management improvement efforts. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities also did not significantly impact operating cash flow. Other operating assets and liabilities utilized $1.6 billion of cash, primarily driven by $1 billion of cash used for a discretionary contribution into a foreign pension plan.36 The Procter & Gamble CompanyFiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012Operating cash flow was $14.9 billion in 2013, a 12% increase from the prior year. Operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, deferred income taxes and gains on sale and purchase of businesses) and a decrease in working capital. Increased accounts receivable used $415 million of cash primarily to fund growth. In addition, accounts receivable days sales outstanding increased two days due to the timing and mix of sales late in the period and foreign exchange impacts. Increased inventory used $225 million of cash to support product initiatives and to build stock to support capacity expansions and manufacturing sourcing changes, partially offset by inventory management improvement efforts. Inventory days on hand increased by one day primarily due to foreign exchange impacts. Increased accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities generated $1.3 billion of cash primarily due to an increase in marketing accruals from increased advertising and other marketing costs.Free Cash Flow. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation. Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013Free cash flow was $10.1 billion in 2014, a decrease of 7% versus the prior year. The decrease was driven by the decrease in operating cash flows, which was primarily due to a $1 billion discretionary contribution into a foreign pension plan. Free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings, was 86% in 2014. Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012Free cash flow was $10.9 billion in 2013, an increase of 17% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by the increase in operating cash flows. Free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings, was 95% in 2013. Investing Cash FlowsFiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013Net investing activities consumed $4.1 billion in cash in 2014 mainly due to capital spending and cash paid for investments in available-for-sale securities, partially offset by asset sales. Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012Net investing activities consumed $6.3 billion in cash in 2013 mainly due to capital spending, cash paid for acquisitions and investments in available-for-sale securities, partially offset by asset sales. Capital Spending. We manage capital spending to support our business growth plans and have cost controls to deliver our cash generation targets. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost savings, were $3.8 billion in 2014 and $4.0 billion in 2013. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points to 4.6% in 2014. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales in 2013 increased 10 basis points to 4.9%.Acquisitions. Acquisition activity was not material in 2014. Acquisitions used $1.1 billion of cash in 2013 primarily for the acquisition of our partner's interest in a joint venture in Iberia. Proceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $570 million in cash in 2014 mainly due to minor brand divestiture activities, including MDVIP, the Pert business in Latin America, and the bleach business in CEEMEA and Latin America. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $584 million in cash in 2013 mainly due to the divestitures of the bleach business in Italy and the Braun household appliances business. Financing Cash FlowsDividend Payments. Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments. Dividends per common share increased 7% to $2.45 per share in 2014. Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $6.9 billion in 2014 and $6.5 billion in 2013. In April 2014, the Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.6015 to $0.6436 per share on Common Stock and Series A and B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock. This represents a 7% increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 58th consecutive year that our dividend has increased. We have paid a dividend in every year since our incorporation in 1890.Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $35.4 billion as of June 30, 2014 and $31.5 billion as of June 30, 2013. Our total debt increased in 2014 mainly due to debt issuances and an increase in commercial paper outstanding, partially offset by bond maturities.Treasury Purchases. Total share repurchases were $6.0 billion in 2014 and 2013. LiquidityAt June 30, 2014, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $2.1 billion ($4.3 billion, excluding current assets and current liabilities of the Pet Care business held for sale), largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. The Company regularly assesses The Procter & Gamble Company 37its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. The majority of our cash is held off-shore by foreign subsidiaries, but we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the United States to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future. We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements.On June 30, 2014, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard & Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings are Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard & Poor's), all with a stable outlook.We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $11.0 billion facility split between a $7.0 billion 5-year facility and a $4.0 billion 364-day facility, which expire in August 2018 and July 2015, respectively. The 364-day facility can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in, and in accordance with, the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain largely undrawn for the foreseeable future. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities.Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity. 38 The Procter & Gamble CompanyContractual CommitmentsThe following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2014.($ millions)Total Less Than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After5 YearsRECORDED LIABILITIES Total debt$35,229 $15,576 $4,391 $3,939 $11,323Capital leases83 19 34 23 7Uncertain tax positions(1)37 37 — — —OTHER Interest payments relating to long-term debt7,929 831 1,385 1,195 4,518Operating leases(2)1,944 288 509 404 743Minimum pension funding(3)817 264 553 — —Purchase obligations(4)1,985 1,068 432 164 321TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS48,024 18,083 7,304 5,725 16,912(1) As of June 30, 2014, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $1.9 billion, including $443 million of interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of June 30, 2014, cannot be made.(2) Operating lease obligations are shown net of guaranteed sublease income.(3) Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2017 are not currently determinable.(4) Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent future purchases in line with expected usage to obtain favorable pricing. Approximately 19% relates to service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.The Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement or net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized to reduce future taxes. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction has already been taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our financial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.The Procter & Gamble Company 39Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. For additional details on the Company's income taxes, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Employee BenefitsWe sponsor various post-employment benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense, since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPEB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2014, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPEB assets was 7.2% and 8.3%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPEB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $111 million.Since pension and OPEB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans of 3.5% and 4.4%, respectively, represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100-basis point change in the pension discount rate would impact annual after-tax defined benefit pension expense by approximately $197 million. A change in the OPEB discount rate of 100 basis points would impact annual after-tax OPEB expense by approximately $79 million. For additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsSignificant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain.We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants, and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, economic barriers to entry, a brand's relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. 40 The Procter & Gamble CompanyUnanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are primarily based on these same factors. All of our acquired technology and customer-related intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives.The costs of determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. We test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the book values of each asset to the estimated fair value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. With the exception of our Appliances, Batteries and Salon Professional businesses, all of our reporting units have fair values that significantly exceed recorded values. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. In addition, any potential change in the strategic plans for these businesses due to the refocusing of our business portfolio could impact these judgments, assumptions, and estimates, in turn, impacting our fair value. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect the financial statements in any given year. The recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets from recently impaired businesses and recently acquired businesses are derived from more recent business operating plans and macroeconomic environmental conditions and therefore are more susceptible to an adverse change that could require an impairment charge.The results of our impairment testing during fiscal 2012 indicated that the estimated fair values of our Appliances and Salon Professional reporting units were less than their respective carrying amounts. Therefore, we recorded a non-cash before- and after-tax impairment charge of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2012. Additionally, our impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets during fiscal 2012 indicated a decline in the fair value of our Koleston Perfect and Wella trade name intangible assets below their respective carrying values. This resulted in a non-cash, before-tax impairment charge of $246 million ($173 million after-tax) to reduce the carrying amounts of these assets to their estimated fair values. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the estimated fair value of our Appliances reporting units declined further, below the carrying amount resulting from the fiscal 2012 impairment. Therefore, we recorded an additional non-cash before and after-tax impairment charge of $259 million in fiscal 2013. Additionally, our fourth quarter 2013 impairment testing for Appliances indicated a decline in the fair value of our Braun trade name intangible asset below its carrying value. This resulted in a non-cash, before-tax impairment charge of $49 million ($31 million after-tax) to reduce the carrying amount of this asset to its estimated fair value.The Appliances business was acquired as part of the Gillette acquisition in 2005 and the Salon Professional business consists primarily of operations acquired in the Wella acquisition in 2004. Both businesses are stand-alone reporting units. These businesses represent some of our more discretionary consumer spending categories. Because of this, their operations and underlying fair values were disproportionately impacted by the economic downturn that began in fiscal 2009, which led to a reduction in home and personal grooming appliance purchases and in visits to hair salons that drove the fiscal 2012 impairment. The additional impairment of the Appliances business in fiscal 2013 was due to the devaluation of currency in Japan, a key country that generates a significant portion of the earnings of the Appliances business, relative to the currencies in which the underlying net assets are recorded. As of June 30, 2014, the Appliances business has remaining goodwill of $317 million and remaining intangible assets of $875 million, while the Salon Professional business has remaining goodwill of $436 million and remaining intangible assets of $726 million. As a result of the impairments, the estimated fair value of our Appliances business and the Salon Professional business slightly exceed their respective carrying values. Our fiscal 2014 valuations of the Appliances and Salon Professional businesses has them returning to sales and earnings growth The Procter & Gamble Company 41rates consistent with our long-term business plans. Changes to or a failure to achieve these business plans or a further deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions could result in a valuation that would trigger an additional impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses.The results of our annual goodwill impairment testing during fiscal 2014 indicated a decline in the fair value of the Batteries reporting unit due to lower long-term market growth assumptions in certain key geographies. The estimated fair value of Batteries continues to exceed its underlying carrying value, but the fair value cushion has been reduced to about 5%. As of June 30, 2014, the Batteries business has goodwill of $2.6 billion and intangible assets of $2.4 billion. The actual Batteries business results for the year ended June 30, 2014 were in line with the 2014 projections used in our annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing. The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. However, actual events and results of the Batteries reporting unit could differ substantially from those used in our valuations. To the extent such factors result in a further reduction of the level of projected cash flows used to estimate the Batteries reporting unit fair value, we may need to record non-cash impairment charges in the future. In addition, in the fourth quarter of the year ended June 30, 2014, a key competitor announced its intent to split its consolidated business into two separate companies during 2015. One of those companies would operate primarily in the batteries category. While this proposed transaction has not been consummated, initial independent third party estimates of the competitor’s stand-alone batteries business valuation are well below the earnings multiple implied from the valuation of our batteries business. We attribute the implied valuation differences to our more favorable business trends, primarily organic net sales and share growth, along with scale dis-synergies, general market uncertainty regarding the capabilities and competitiveness of a stand-alone company and lack of a control premium. In addition, the Company conducts a regular portfolio review of its businesses to assess long-term strategic fit. If our portfolio review process were to result in a decision to divest the batteries business, a divestiture could result in a loss that could be material if potential acquirers utilize valuations consistent with those indicated above for the key competitor. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing results. New Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).” This guidance outlines a single, comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. We will adopt the standard on July 1, 2017. We are evaluating the impact, if any, that the standard will have on our financial statements.No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.OTHER INFORMATIONHedging and Derivative Financial InstrumentsAs a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. Except within financing operations, we leverage the Company's broadly diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes a detailed discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments.Derivative positions can be monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the CorporateManager™ value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics™ dataset as of June 30, 2014. In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics™, a reasonable proxy is included.Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term.Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on 42 The Procter & Gamble Companyour investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments.Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June 30, 2014, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements.Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with our financing operations, we primarily use forward contracts with maturities of less than 18 months. In addition, we enter into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions.Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2014, we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements.Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures.As of and during the years ended June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013, we did not have any commodity hedging activity.Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAPOur discussion of financial results includes several ""non-GAAP"" financial measures. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in MD&A, we have provided the comparable GAAP measure in the discussion. These measures include:Organic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Organic sales is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.

This is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. This includes charges in 2014, 2013 and 2012 for incremental restructuring due to increased focus on productivity and cost savings, charges in 2014 and 2013 for the balance sheet impacts from foreign exchange policy changes and the devaluations of the official foreign currency exchange rate in Venezuela, charges in 2014, 2013 and 2012 related to pending European legal matters, a holding gain in 2013 on the purchase of the balance of our Iberian joint venture (JV), and impairment charges in 2013 and 2012 for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We do not view these items to be part of our sustainable results. We believe the Core EPS measure provides an important perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year earnings per share growth. Core EPS is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.The Procter & Gamble Company 43The table below provides a reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to Core EPS:Years ended June 302014 2013 2012Diluted net earnings per share - continuing operations$3.98 $3.83 $3.06Incremental restructuring charges0.12 0.18 0.20Venezuela balance sheet devaluation Impacts0.09 0.08 —Charges for pending European legal matters0.02 0.05 0.03Gain on purchase of balance of Iberian JV— (0.21) —Impairment charges— 0.10 0.51Rounding0.01 (0.01) (0.01)CORE EPS4.22 4.02 3.79Core EPS Growth5% 6% (1)%Note - All reconciling items are presented net of tax. Tax effects are calculated consistent with the nature of the underlying transaction. Free Cash Flow. Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending. We view free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. Free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.Free Cash Flow Productivity. Free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. Free cash flow productivity is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of free cash flow and free cash flow productivity ($ millions): OperatingCash FlowCapitalSpendingFreeCash FlowNetEarningsFreeCash FlowProductivity2014$13,958$(3,848)$10,110$11,78586%201314,873(4,008)10,86511,40295%201213,284(3,964)9,32010,90485%Item 7A.

The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections:•Overview•Summary of 2015 Results •Economic Conditions and Uncertainties•Results of Operations•Segment Results•Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity•Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates•Other InformationThroughout the MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), free cash flow, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain specified charges and gains. Free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending. Adjusted free cash flow is free cash flow excluding tax payments for the Pet Care divestiture. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding impairment charges on the Batteries business and the Venezuelan deconsolidation charge. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides more details on the use and derivation of these measures.Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category and are measured on an annual basis versus the prior 12-month period. References to competitive activity include promotional and product initiatives from our competitors.OVERVIEWP&G is a global leader in fast-moving consumer goods, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, salons, distributors, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.23 The Procter & Gamble CompanyORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTUREOur organizational structure is comprised of Global Business Units (GBUs), Selling and Market Operations (SMOs), Global Business Services (GBS) and Corporate Functions (CF).Global Business UnitsOur Global Business Units (GBUs) are organized into four industry-based sectors, comprised of 1) Global Beauty, 2) Global Health and Grooming, 3) Global Fabric and Home Care and 4) Global Baby, Feminine and Family Care. Under U.S. GAAP, the GBUs underlying the four sectors are aggregated into five reportable segments: Beauty, Hair and Personal Care; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby, Feminine and Family Care. The GBUs are responsible for developing overall brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovations and marketing plans. The following provides additional detail on our reportable segments and the key product categories and brand composition within each segment.Reportable Segment% ofNet Sales*% of NetEarnings*GBUs (Categories)Billion Dollar BrandsBeauty, Hair and Personal Care24%23%Skin and Personal Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); Cosmetics; Hair Care and Color; Prestige; Salon ProfessionalHead & Shoulders, Olay, Pantene, SK-II, WellaGrooming10%16%Shave Care (Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care); Electronic Hair RemovalFusion, Gillette, Mach3, PrestobarbaHealth Care10%11%Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care); Oral Care (Toothbrush, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care)Crest, Oral-B, VicksFabric Care and Home Care29%24%Fabric Care (Laundry Additives, Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care)Ariel, Dawn, Downy, Febreze, Gain, TideBaby, Feminine and Family Care27%26%Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper)Always, Bounty, Charmin, Pampers*Percent of net sales and net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2015 (excluding results held in Corporate).Recent Developments: As of June 30, 2015, the Company deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting. This change resulted in a fourth quarter fiscal 2015 one-time after-tax charge of $2.1 billion ($0.71 per share). In future periods, our financial results will only include sales of finished goods to our Venezuela subsidiaries to the extent we receive cash payments from Venezuela (expected to be largely through the CENCOEX exchange market). Accordingly, we will no longer include the results of our local Venezuelan subsidiaries' operations in future reporting periods (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and additional discussion in this MD&A under ""Venezuela Impacts"" in Results of Operations). In August 2014, the Company announced a plan to significantly streamline our product portfolio by divesting, discontinuing or consolidating about 100 non-strategic brands. The resulting portfolio of about 65 key brands will retain about 85% of sales and 95% of before-tax profit. On July 9, 2015, the Company announced the signing of a definitive agreement with Coty, Inc. to divest four product categories, including 43 of its beauty brands to Coty Inc. Coty's offer was $12.5 billion. While the final value of the transaction will be determined at closing, based on Coty's stock price and outstanding shares and equity grants as of the date of signing, the value of the transaction was approximately $15.0 billion. While the ultimate form of the transaction has not yet been decided, the Company’s current preference is for a Reverse Morris Trust split-off transaction in which P&G shareholders could elect to participate in an exchange offer to exchange P&G shares for Coty shares. The transaction includes P&G’s global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and fine fragrance categories, along with select hair styling brands, all of which have historically been part of the Company's Beauty, Hair and Personal Care reportable segment and had net sales of $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2015. The Company expects to complete this beauty transaction by the end of calendar year 2016. For the period ended June 30, 2015, the results of the affected beauty categories and brands remain part of our continuing operations. Beginning with fiscal year 2015-16 reported results, the earnings, assets and liabilities from the affected beauty businesses will be reported as discontinued operations. On November 13, 2014, the Company announced that it plans to divest the Batteries business via a split transaction with Berkshire Hathaway valued at $2.9 billion, in which it will exchange a recapitalized Duracell Company for Berkshire Hathaway’s shares of Procter & Gamble stock. The Company had previously sold its controlling interest in a China-based batteries joint venture, which represented the balance of the The Procter & Gamble Company 24Company’s Batteries business, during the quarter ended December 31, 2014. The Company expects to complete the Duracell transaction in the beginning of calendar year 2016, pending necessary regulatory approvals. The Batteries business had historically been part of the Company’s Fabric Care and Home Care reportable segment. The results of the Batteries business are now presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Additionally, the Batteries balance sheet positions as of June 30, 2015 are presented as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.During fiscal 2015, the Company completed the divestiture of its Pet Care business. The gain on the transaction was not material. The results of the Pet Care business are now presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Additionally, the Pet Care balance sheet positions as of June 30, 2014 are presented as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.With these transactions and other recently completed and announced minor brand divestitures, the Company will have substantially completed the strategic portfolio reshaping program with 93 out of approximately 100 brands having been sold, discontinued or consolidated.Beauty, Hair and Personal Care: We are a global market leader in the beauty category. Most of the beauty markets in which we compete are highly fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. We compete in beauty care, hair care and color and prestige. In beauty care, we offer a wide variety of products, ranging from deodorants to cosmetics to skin care, such as our Olay brand, which is the top facial skin care brand in the world with over 8% global market share. In hair care and color, we compete in both the retail and salon professional channels. We are the global market leader in the retail hair care and color market with over 20% global market share primarily behind our Pantene and Head & Shoulders brands. In the prestige channel, we compete primarily with our prestige fragrances behind Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci and Hugo Boss fragrance brands and the SK-II brand.Grooming: We are the global market leader in the blades and razors market. Our global blades and razors market share is over 65%, primarily behind the Gillette franchise including Fusion, Mach3, Prestobarba and Venus. Our electronic hair removal devices, such as electric razors and epilators, are sold under the Braun brand in a number of markets around the world where we compete against both global and regional competitors. We hold over 20% of the male shavers market and nearly 50% of the female epilators market.Health Care: We compete in oral care and personal health care. In oral care, there are several global competitors in the market and we have the number two market share position with approximately 20% global market share. In personal health care, we are a top ten competitor in a large, highly fragmented industry behind respiratory treatments (Vicks brand) and nonprescription heartburn medications (Prilosec OTC brand). Nearly all of our sales outside the U.S. in personal health care are generated through the PGT Healthcare partnership with Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Fabric Care and Home Care: This segment is comprised of a variety of fabric care products including laundry detergents, additives and fabric enhancers; and home care products including dishwashing liquids and detergents, surface cleaners and air fresheners. In fabric care, we generally have the number one or number two share position in the markets in which we compete and are the global market leader with approximately 30% global market share, primarily behind our Tide, Ariel and Downy brands. Our global home care market share is approximately 20% across the categories in which we compete.Baby, Feminine and Family Care: In baby care, we compete mainly in diapers, pants and baby wipes with over 30% global market share. We are the number one or number two baby care competitor in most of the key markets in which we compete, primarily behind Pampers, the Company's largest brand, with annual net sales of approximately $10 billion. We are the global market leader in the feminine care category with approximately 30% global market share, primarily behind Always. We have recently entered the adult incontinence category in certain markets, achieving nearly a 10% market share in those markets where we have entered. Our family care business is predominantly a North American business comprised largely of the Bounty paper towel and Charmin toilet paper brands. U.S. market shares are nearly 45% for Bounty and over 25% for Charmin.Selling and Market OperationsOur SMOs are responsible for developing and executing go-to-market plans at the local level. The SMOs include dedicated retail customer, trade channel and country-specific teams. Our SMOs are organized under six regions comprised of North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Greater China and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA). Throughout the MD&A, we reference business results in developed markets, which are comprised of North America, Western Europe and Japan, and developing markets which are all other markets not included in developed. Global Business ServicesGBS provides technology, processes and standard data tools to enable the GBUs and the SMOs to better understand the business and better serve consumers and customers. The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class solutions at a low cost and with minimal capital investment.Corporate FunctionsCF provides Company-level strategy and portfolio analysis, corporate accounting, treasury, tax, external relations, governance, human resources and legal, as well as other centralized functional support.STRATEGIC FOCUSWe are focused on strategies that we believe are right for the long-term health of the Company with the objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group.Our value creation progress is measured internally with the operating total shareholder return (O-TSR) model. Over time, 25 The Procter & Gamble CompanyO-TSR performance is highly correlated with market total shareholder returns. O-TSR is a balanced measure that requires strong performance across the three primary drivers of value creation: sales growth, profit margin expansion and efficient utilization of assets to generate strong, reliable operating cash flow. We operationalize O-TSR deep within the Company by defining tight linkages between business activities and the key drivers of value creation, from strategic choices of global business units, brands and country teams down to individual employees’ daily work plans.The Company has recently undertaken an effort to focus and strengthen its business portfolio to compete in categories and brands that are structurally attractive and that play to P&G strengths. This will enable us to allocate resources to leading brands - marketed in the right set of countries, channels and customers - where the size of the prize and probability of winning is highest. When the major portion of this work is complete, we expect to compete in four industry-based sectors made up of approximately ten product categories and 65 leading brands.Innovation has always been - and continues to be - P&G's lifeblood. To consistently win with consumers around the world across price tiers and preferences and to consistently win versus our best competitors, each P&G product category needs a full portfolio of innovation, including a mix of commercial programs, product improvements and game-changing innovations. We are also innovating to improve our category, brand and market business models to better serve consumers and customers.Productivity is a core strength for P&G, which creates flexibility to fund our growth efforts, offset cost challenges and/or improve operating margins. We have taken significant steps to accelerate productivity and savings across all elements of costs, including cost of goods sold, marketing expense and non-manufacturing overhead. These efforts are yielding significant benefits to our operating margin.Finally, we are focused on improving execution and operating discipline in everything we do. Operating discipline and execution have always been - and must continue to be - core capabilities and competitive advantages for P&G.The Company expects the delivery of the following long-term annual financial targets will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive peer group:•Organic sales growth above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete;•Core EPS growth of high single digits; and•Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater.In periods with significant macroeconomic pressures, we will maintain a disciplined approach to investing so as not to sacrifice the long-term health of our businesses to meet short-term objectives in any given year.SUMMARY OF 2015 RESULTSAmounts in millions, except per share amounts2015 Change vs. Prior Year 2014 Change vs. Prior Year 2013Net sales$76,279 (5)% $80,510 —% $80,116Operating income11,790 (20)% 14,740 7% 13,817Net earnings from continuing operations8,930 (21)% 11,318 3% 10,953Net earnings/(loss) from discontinued operations(1,786) (482)% 467 4% 449Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble7,036 (40)% 11,643 3% 11,312Diluted net earnings per common share2.44 (39)% 4.01 4% 3.86Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations3.06 (21)% 3.86 4% 3.71Core earnings per common share4.02 (2)% 4.09 5% 3.89•Net sales decreased 5% to $76.3 billion including a negative 6% impact from foreign exchange.◦Organic sales increased 1%.◦Unit volume decreased 1%.

All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are ""forward-looking statements"" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors in this 10-K.Global Economic Conditions. Current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as greater political unrest in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, further economic instability in the European Union, political instability in certain Latin American markets and economic slowdowns in Japan and China, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our earnings.Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. If we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings. Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. As discussed later in this MD&A, we initiated certain non-manufacturing overhead reduction projects along with manufacturing and other supply chain cost improvements projects in 2012. If we are not successful in executing these changes, there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings.Foreign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In 2015 and 2014, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Russia, Ukraine, Japan and Switzerland, have had, and could have, an additional significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings. Increased pricing in response to these fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts, but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales.Government Policies. Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies. For example, the U.S. is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly impact the corporate tax rate and change the U.S. tax treatment of international earnings. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt and currency exposure in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Argentina, China, Egypt, Greece, India, Nigeria, Ukraine and Venezuela. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, operating margin and net earnings. During fiscal 2015, the Company deconsolidated its Venezuelan subsidiaries due to evolving conditions that have resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar and have restricted our ability to pay dividends and satisfy certain other obligations denominated in U.S. dollars.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, SG&A, other non-operating items and income taxes. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, the level of initiatives and other activities by competitors, geographic expansion and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume as well as pricing actions (which can also indirectly impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the U.S.Most of our cost of products sold and SG&A are to some extent variable in nature. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty, Hair and Personal Care segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and to a lesser extent scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary drivers of SG&A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we do achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other 27 The Procter & Gamble Companymarketing efficiencies. Overhead costs are also variable in nature, but on a relative basis, less so than marketing costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth. Accordingly, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs. The Company is in the midst of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, marketing and overhead expenses. The plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. Net SalesFiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014Net sales decreased 5% to $76.3 billion in 2015 on a 1% decrease in unit volume versus the prior year period. Volume grew low single digits in Fabric Care and Home Care. Volume decreased low single digits in Baby, Feminine and Family Care, Grooming and Health Care and decreased mid-single digits in Beauty, Hair and Personal Care. Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and declined low single digits in developing regions due, in part, to pricing actions to address foreign exchange devaluations. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 6%, while higher pricing drove a 2% favorable impact on net sales. Organic volume decreased 1% and organic sales grew 1% driven by higher pricing.Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013Net sales increased less than half a percent to $80.5 billion in 2014 on a 3% increase in unit volume versus the prior year period. Fabric Care and Home Care along with Baby, Feminine and Family Care volume grew mid-single digits. Grooming and Health Care volume grew low single digits. Beauty, Hair and Personal Care volume was unchanged. Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and grew mid-single digits in developing regions. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 3%. Organic sales grew 3% driven by the unit volume increase. A 1% favorable impact from higher pricing was offset by a 1% impact from unfavorable geographic and product mix due to higher relative growth of developing regions, which have lower than average selling prices, and of lower priced product categories such as Fabric Care and Baby Care.Operating Costs Comparisons as a percentage of net sales; Years ended June 302015 Basis Point Change 2014 Basis Point Change 2013Gross margin49.0% (10) 49.1% (100) 50.1%Selling, general and administrative expense30.9% 10 30.8% (170) 32.5%Operating margin15.5% (280) 18.3% 110 17.2%Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes15.5% (230) 17.8% 10 17.7%Net earnings from continuing operations11.7% (240) 14.1% 40 13.7%Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble9.2% (530) 14.5% 40 14.1%Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014Gross margin decreased 10 basis points to 49.0% of net sales in 2015. Gross margin benefited from a 200 basis point impact from manufacturing cost savings and a 90 basis point benefit from higher pricing. These impacts were offset by a 140 basis point impact from unfavorable geographic and product mix, primarily from a decline in the Prestige business, which has higher than average margins, and within the Fabric Care and Home Care and Grooming segments. Additional offsets include a 40 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign exchange, a 40 basis point impact from costs related to initiatives and capacity investments, a 30 basis point impact from higher restructuring costs and smaller impacts from lower volume scale and higher commodity costs.Total SG&A decreased 5% to $23.6 billion, as reduced overhead and marketing spending was partially offset by increased foreign exchange transaction charges. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points to 30.9%, as the negative scale impacts of lower net sales and inflationary impacts were partially offset by cost savings efforts. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 60 basis points behind lower spending due to efficiency efforts. Overhead spending as a percentage of net sales increased 40 basis points as productivity savings of 60 basis points from reduced overhead spending were more than offset by wage inflation, investments in research and development, the negative scale impacts of lower net sales and higher restructuring costs. Increased foreign exchange transaction charges added approximately 30 basis points to SG&A as a percentage of net sales, as current year foreign currency transaction charges (from revaluing receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than a local entity’s functional currency) were partially offset by lower year-on-year charges for Venezuela remeasurement and devaluation.During fiscal 2015, the Company incurred a $2.0 billion ($2.1 billion after tax) charge related to the deconsolidation of its Venezuelan subsidiaries. See the “Venezuela Impacts” later in the Results of Operations section.The Procter & Gamble Company 28Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013Gross margin contracted 100 basis points to 49.1% of net sales in 2014. The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by a 150 basis point impact from unfavorable geographic and product mix, a 50 basis point impact from higher commodity costs and a 90 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings of 190 basis points and a 40 basis point benefit from higher pricing. The unfavorable geographic and product mix was caused by disproportionate growth in developing regions and the Fabric Care and Home Care and Baby, Feminine and Family Care segments, which have lower gross margins than the Company average.Total SG&A decreased 5% to $24.8 billion in 2014 due to a reduction in marketing spending, overhead expense, impairment charges and restructuring costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 170 basis points to 30.8%. Lower restructuring spending drove 30 basis points of the decline. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 80 basis points primarily due to lower spending behind a focus on more efficient marketing support and scale benefits from increased net sales. Overhead spending decreased 50 basis points from productivity savings. Impairment charges were 40 basis points in 2013, but were zero in 2014. Charges for the 2014 foreign currency policy changes in Venezuela were comparable to the 2013 Venezuela devaluation impact.During fiscal 2013, we incurred impairment charges of $308 million ($290 million after tax) related to the carrying value of goodwill in our Appliances business and the related Braun trade name intangible asset.Non-Operating ItemsFiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014Interest expense was $626 million in 2015, a decrease of $84 million versus the prior year due to lower average debt balances and a decrease in weighted average interest rates. Interest income was $151 million in 2015, an increase of $50 million versus the prior year due to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. Other non-operating income, net, primarily includes divestiture gains and investment income. Other non-operating income increased $325 million to $531 million, primarily due to minor brand divestiture gains. In 2015, we had approximately $400 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Zest, Camay, Fekkai and Wash & Go hair care brands, Rochas and Laura Biagotti fine fragrance brands and Vaposteam. The prior year acquisition and divestiture activities included approximately $150 million in divestiture gains, primarily related to the sale of our bleach businesses in Europe, IMEA and Latin America, our Pert hair care business in Latin America and MDVIP.Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013Interest expense increased 6% in 2014 to $710 million, primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding. Interest income was $101 million in 2014, an increase of $13 million versus the prior year due to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. Other non-operating income, net, primarily includes divestiture gains and investment income. Other non-operating income decreased $735 million to $206 million, primarily due to acquisition and divestiture impacts. In 2014, we had approximately $150 million in divestiture gains, primarily related to the sale of our bleach businesses in Europe, IMEA and Latin America, our Pert hair care business in Latin America and MDVIP. The 2013 acquisition and divestiture activities included a $631 million holding gain resulting from P&G's purchase of the balance of its Baby Care and Feminine Care joint venture in Iberia and an approximate $250 million gain from the divestiture of our Italy bleach business.Income TaxesFiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 350 basis points to 24.6% in 2015 mainly due to the non-deductibility of the $2.0 billion Venezuelan deconsolidation charge. The rate increase caused by lower current year favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions (the net benefit was 80 basis points in the current year versus 160 basis points in the prior year) was largely offset by a decrease related to favorable geographic earnings mix.Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 170 basis points to 21.1% in 2014. The primary driver of this rate decline was approximately 320 basis points from the favorable geographic mix of earnings and approximately 60 basis points due to the non-deductibility of the 2013 impairment charges related to our Appliances business. These impacts were partially offset by a 50 basis point increase due to the Venezuela currency policy changes and devaluation discussed below (which decreased the prior year rate 20 basis points and increased the current year rate by 30 basis points), a 110 basis point increase due to the tax impacts of acquisition and divestiture activities (the gains from the purchase of the balance of the Baby Care and Feminine Care joint venture in Iberia and the sale of our Italy bleach business in 2013) and a 30 basis point increase due to the net impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions. The net benefit 2014 was $228 million, or 160 basis points, versus 190 basis points of net benefit in 2013.Net EarningsFiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014Net earnings from continuing operations decreased $2.4 billion or 21% to $8.9 billion due to the $2.1 billion after tax charge related to the deconsolidation of Venezuelan subsidiaries and the decline in net sales, partially offset by reduced selling, general and administrative costs (SG&A). Foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings by approximately $1.4 billion in 2015 due to the weakening of certain key currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily in Russia, Ukraine, Venezuela and Argentina, partially offset by lower after-tax charges related to balance sheet remeasurement charges in Venezuela.29 The Procter & Gamble CompanyNet earnings from discontinued operations decreased $2.3 billion in 2015 due primarily to $2.1 billion of after tax impairment charges in our Batteries business (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and the absence of fiscal 2015 earnings from our divested Pet Care business. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased $4.6 billion, or 40% to $7.0 billion.Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations decreased $0.80, or 21%, to $3.06 due to the decrease in net earnings. We had a diluted net loss per share from discontinued operations of $0.62 due primarily to the impairment charges on the Batteries business. This was a reduction of $0.78 per share versus the prior year. Diluted net earnings per share decreased $1.57, or 39%, to $2.44.Core EPS decreased 2% to $4.02. Core EPS represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges for Venezuelan deconsolidation, balance sheet remeasurement charges from foreign exchange policy changes and devaluation in Venezuela (see below), charges for certain European legal matters and incremental restructuring related to our productivity and cost savings plan. The decline was driven by reduced net sales, partially offset by minor brand divestiture gains.Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013Net earnings from continuing operations increased $365 million or 3% to $11.3 billion in 2014 due to the increase in sales and a 40-basis point expansion in net earnings margin. The increase in net earnings margin was primarily driven by the decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales and the lower tax rate, partially offset by the gross margin contraction and the acquisition and divestiture-driven net reduction in other non-operating income, net. Net earnings from discontinued operations increased $18 million in 2014 due to stronger results in our Batteries business offsetting the ongoing impacts of prior year product recalls in Pet Care. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $331 million, or 3% to $11.6 billion.Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 4% to $3.86 primarily due to the increase in net earnings. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations was $0.15 due to the earnings of the Batteries and Pet Care businesses. Diluted net earnings per share increased 4% to $4.01.Core EPS increased 5% to $4.09 primarily due to increased net sales, a 40 basis point net earnings margin expansion and the reduction in shares outstanding. Core EPS represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges from foreign exchange policy changes and the devaluation of the foreign exchange rates in Venezuela (see below), the 2013 holding gain on the purchase of the balance of our Iberian joint venture, the 2013 impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and charges in both years for European legal matters and incremental restructuring related to our productivity and cost savings plan. Venezuela ImpactsEffective June 30, 2015, the Company deconsolidated its local Venezuelan operations from our Consolidated Financial Statements. P&G has operated in Venezuela for over 65 years and remains committed to serving Venezuelan consumers with our leading brands and products to grow our business. We expect our operations in Venezuela will continue for the foreseeable future. We continue to work proactively with the Venezuelan official agencies to ensure we fully understand and remain compliant as the policies within which our Venezuelan subsidiaries operate evolve. We do not expect this change in accounting to directly affect the local operations of our Venezuelan subsidiaries.There are a number of currency and other operating controls and restrictions in Venezuela, which have evolved over time and may continue to evolve in the future. These evolving conditions have resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar and have restricted our Venezuelan operations’ ability to pay dividends and satisfy certain other obligations denominated in U.S. dollars. For accounting purposes, this has resulted in a lack of control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Therefore, in accordance with the applicable accounting standards for consolidation, effective June 30, 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting. This change resulted in a fourth quarter fiscal 2015 one-time before-tax charge of $2.0 billion ($2.1 billion after tax, or $0.71 per share). In future periods, our financial results will only include sales of finished goods to our Venezuelan subsidiaries to the extent we receive payments from Venezuela (expected to be largely through the CENCOEX exchange market). Accordingly, we will no longer include the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries’ operations in future reporting periods (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Our operations in Venezuela accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net sales and earnings from continuing operations (before the deconsolidation charge) during fiscal 2015.Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. As a result, prior to deconsolidation, the U.S. dollar had been the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Venezuela. A number of changes have been initiated in the Venezuelan exchange rate system, including changes that resulted in devaluations to their currency. Prior to deconsolidation, currency remeasurement adjustments for non-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by our Venezuelan subsidiaries, along with any other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses, have been reflected in earnings, and totaled $104 million, $275 million and $236 million on an after-tax basis in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.There are currently three official exchange rate mechanisms in Venezuela. The CENCOEX (National Center for External Commerce) exchange rate is 6.3 Venezuelan bolivares fuerte (VEF) per dollar and can be used for the importation of certain qualifying products and materials. SICAD (Complementary The Procter & Gamble Company 30System for Foreign Exchange Administration) is an auction-based exchange program applicable to foreign investment transactions and certain other qualifying imports of finished goods and materials. The rate available through SICAD was 10.6 VEF per dollar at June 30, 2014 and 12.8 VEF per dollar at June 30, 2015. A third exchange mechanism, referred to as SIMADI (Sistema Marginal de Divisas), is also an auction-based program recently trading at approximately 200 VEF per dollar.Through December 31, 2013, Venezuela had only one officially established exchange rate for qualifying dividends and imported goods and services, the CENCOEX rate, previously CADIVI (Foreign Exchange Administrative Commission). Accordingly, through December 31, 2013, our results in Venezuela and all of our net monetary assets were measured at this exchange rate. On January 24, 2014, a number of announcements were made affecting currency exchange rate and other controls, including the introduction of the SICAD and SICAD II exchange rate mechanisms. In addition, based on local regulatory guidance, we had expected dividends to be executed under the SICAD rate. Accordingly, beginning in January 2014, other than transactions flowing through CENCOEX, our historical operations and balance sheet positions were generally measured using the SICAD rate. In January 2015, additional announcements were made relating to currency exchange rate and other controls, including the elimination of the SICAD II exchange rate and the introduction of the SIMADI rate.A significant portion of our imports have historically qualified for the CENCOEX rate. While we continue to import certain materials and products under this rate, payments for such qualifying imports have declined in recent years. At this time, there is considerable uncertainty as to how CENCOEX will operate in the future, including the nature and quantity of transactions that will continue to flow through CENCOEX. However, we believe a portion of our imports will continue to qualify for the preferential rate. We have had no recent access to the SICAD market for imports or dividends. To date, we have had limited access to the SIMADI market. Our plans and ability to access that market in the future is unclear.SEGMENT RESULTSSegment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. The results of these reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs such as interest expense, investing activities and certain restructuring and asset impairment costs. These costs are reported in our Corporate segment and are included as part of our Corporate segment discussion. Additionally, as described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we apply blended statutory tax rates in the segments. Eliminations to adjust segment results to arrive at our effective tax rate are included in Corporate. All references to net earnings throughout the discussion of segment results refer to net earnings from continuing operations.Net Sales Change Drivers (2015 vs. 2014) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume Excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Foreign Exchange Price Mix Other Net Sales GrowthBeauty, Hair and Personal Care(4)% (3)% (5)% 2% 0% 0 % (7)%Grooming(3)% (3)% (8)% 4% 0% 0 % (7)%Health Care(1)% (1)% (5)% 2% 3% 0 % (1)%Fabric Care and Home Care1 % 1 % (6)% 1% 0% (1)% (5)%Baby, Feminine and Family Care(1)% (1)% (6)% 2% 2% 0 % (3)%TOTAL COMPANY(1)% (1)% (6)% 2% 0% 0 % (5)% Net Sales Change Drivers (2014 vs. 2013) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume Excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Foreign Exchange Price Mix Other Net Sales GrowthBeauty, Hair and Personal Care0% 0% (2)% 0 % 0 % 0% (2)%Grooming1% 1% (3)% 4 % (2)% 0% 0 %Health Care2% 2% (1)% 1 % (1)% 0% 1 %Fabric Care and Home Care4% 5% (3)% (1)% 0 % 0% 0 %Baby, Feminine and Family Care4% 3% (3)% 1 % 0 % 0% 2 %TOTAL COMPANY3% 3% (3)% 1 % (1)% 0% 0 %Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied.

Global market share of the baby care category decreased slightly. •Volume in Feminine Care increased mid-single digits due to a mid-single-digit increase in developed regions, from the buyout of our joint venture partner in Iberia and innovation, and a low single-digit increase in developing regions from market growth and innovation. Organic volume was up low single digits. Global market share of the feminine care category decreased less than half a point. •Volume in Family Care increased low single digits due to product innovation on Charmin and Bounty and lower pricing, partially offset by competitive activity. In the U.S., all-outlet share of the family care category decreased less than half point. Net earnings decreased 4% to $2.9 billion as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 90-basis point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased primarily due to gross margin contraction. Gross margin decreased due to the impact of foreign exchange, higher commodity cost and unfavorable product and geographic mix from disproportionate growth in developing regions and mid-tier products, both of which have lower gross margins than the segment average, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and pricing. CORPORATE($ millions)2015 Change vs. 2014 2014 Change vs. 2013Net sales$466 (37)% $737 31%Net earnings$(2,181) N/A $(169) N/ACorporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business units. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; other general corporate items; the historical gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; certain asset impairment charges; certain balance sheet impacts from significant foreign exchange devaluations; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling item is income taxes to adjust from blended statutory tax rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate.Net sales in Corporate decreased by $271 million in the current year primarily due to the prior year divestiture of the MDVIP business. Corporate net expenses from continuing operations increased $2.0 billion in 2015, primarily due the charge related to the deconsolidation of the Venezuelan subsidiaries, increased foreign exchange transactional charges and incremental restructuring charges, which were partially offset by gains on minor brand divestitures. Net sales in Corporate increased by $173 million in 2014. Corporate net earnings from continuing operations improved by $164 million in 2014, primarily due to reduced net after-tax goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges (which totaled $290 million in 2013 but were zero in 2014), lower 2014 restructuring and overhead spending and lower overall Company effective tax rate, partially offset by the holding gain in 2013 from the buyout of our Iberian joint venture partner. Additional discussion of the items impacting net earnings in Corporate are included in the Results of Operations section.Productivity and Cost Savings PlanIn 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy.As part of this plan, the Company expects to incur in excess of $5.0 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a six-year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017). Approximately 78% of the costs have been incurred through the end of fiscal 2015. Savings generated from the restructuring costs are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the corollary benefits achieved (e.g., enrollment reduction achieved via normal attrition), the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. Overall, these costs and other non-manufacturing enrollment reductions are expected to deliver approximately $3.0 billion in annual before-tax gross savings. The cumulative before-tax savings realized through 2015 were approximately $2.1 billion.Restructuring accruals of $389 million as of June 30, 2015 are classified as current liabilities. Approximately 70% of the restructuring charges incurred during fiscal 2015 either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting.In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins.35 The Procter & Gamble CompanyRefer to Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program and to the Operating Costs section of this MD&A for more information about the total benefit to operating margins from our total savings efforts.CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates.Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.Operating Cash FlowFiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014Operating cash flow was $14.6 billion in 2015, a 5% increase from the prior year. Operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, impairment charges, gains on sale of businesses and the Venezuela deconsolidation charge) and a decrease in working capital, partially offset by the impact of other operating assets and liabilities. Reduced accounts receivable generated $349 million of cash due to changes in customer terms and improved collection results. The number of days sales outstanding decreased 5 days due to foreign exchange impacts and improvements in collection results and customer terms. Lower inventory generated $313 million of cash mainly due to supply chain optimizations and lower commodity costs. Inventory days on hand decreased 7 days due to foreign exchange impacts, supply chain optimizations and lower commodity costs. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $928 million in operating cash flow primarily driven by extended payment terms. Other operating assets and liabilities utilized $976 million of cash primarily to eliminate the deferred tax impacts associated with the Pet Care divestiture.Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013Operating cash flow was $14.0 billion in 2014, a 6% decrease from the prior year, which was primarily driven by a $1.0 billion discretionary contribution into a foreign pension plan. Operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes and gains on sale of businesses) partially offset by the impact of other operating assets and liabilities. Working capital changes did not have a significant impact on operating cash flow in 2014. Reduced accounts receivable generated $87 million of cash primarily due to improved collection results, which, along with the timing and mix of sales late in the period, drove a 1 day decrease in accounts receivable days sales outstanding. Inventory changes did not significantly impact operating cash flow as inventory management improvement efforts offset inventory needed to support product initiatives and build stock to support capacity expansions and manufacturing sourcing changes. Inventory days on hand decreased by 3 days primarily due to inventory management improvement efforts. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities also did not significantly impact operating cash flow. Other operating assets and liabilities utilized $1.6 billion of cash, primarily driven by $1.0 billion of cash used for a discretionary contribution into a foreign pension plan.Adjusted Free Cash Flow. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding certain divestiture impacts (tax payments in the current year for the Pet Care divestiture) and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation. Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014Adjusted free cash flow was $11.6 billion in 2015, an increase of 15% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by the increase in operating cash flows. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding impairment charges on the Batteries business and the Venezuelan deconsolidation charge, was 102% in 2015. Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013Adjusted free cash flow was $10.1 billion in 2014, a decrease of 7% versus the prior year. The decrease was driven by the decrease in operating cash flows, which was primarily due to a $1.0 billion discretionary contribution into a foreign pension plan. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding impairment charges from divested businesses, was 86% in 2014. Investing Cash FlowFiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014Net investing activities consumed $2.9 billion in cash in 2015 mainly due to capital spending, net purchases of available-for-sale securities and a reduction in cash due to Venezuela deconsolidation, partially offset by asset sales. Fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal year 2013Net investing activities consumed $4.1 billion in cash in 2014 mainly due to capital spending and cash paid for investments in available-for-sale securities, partially offset by asset sales. Capital Spending. We manage capital spending to support our business growth plans and have cost controls to deliver our cash generation targets. Capital expenditures, primarily to The Procter & Gamble Company 36support capacity expansion, innovation and cost efficiencies, were $3.7 billion in 2015 and $3.8 billion in 2014. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points to 4.9% in 2015. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales in 2014 decreased 10 basis points versus 2013 to 4.8%.Acquisitions. Acquisition activity was not material in 2015 or 2014. Proceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales in 2015 contributed $4.5 billion in cash, primarily from the sale of our Pet Care business, the sale of our Chinese battery venture, and other minor brand divestitures. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $570 million in cash in 2014 mainly due to minor brand divestiture activities, including MDVIP, the Pert business in Latin America and the bleach business in Europe, IMEA and Latin America.Financing Cash FlowDividend Payments. Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments. Dividends per common share increased 6% to $2.59 per share in 2015. Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $7.3 billion in 2015 and $6.9 billion in 2014. In April 2015, the Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.6436 to $0.6629 per share on Common Stock and Series A and B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock. This represents a 3% increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 59th consecutive year that our dividend has increased. We have paid a dividend for 125 years, every year since our incorporation in 1890.Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $30.4 billion as of June 30, 2015 and $35.4 billion as of June 30, 2014. Our total debt decreased in 2015 mainly due to debt maturities, partially offset by debt issuances.Treasury Purchases. Total share repurchases were $4.6 billion in 2015 and $6.0 billion in 2014.LiquidityAt June 30, 2015, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $144 million ($2.5 billion, excluding current assets and current liabilities of the Batteries business held for sale), largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. As of June 30, 2015, $11.0 billion of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities is held off-shore by foreign subsidiaries. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. We do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future. We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements.On June 30, 2015, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard & Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings are Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard & Poor's), all with a stable outlook.We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $11.0 billion facility split between a $7.0 billion five-year facility and a $4.0 billion 364-day facility, which expire in August 2018 and July 2016, respectively. The 364-day facility can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain largely undrawn for the foreseeable future. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities. For additional details on debt see Note 4.Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity.37 The Procter & Gamble CompanyContractual CommitmentsThe following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2015.Amounts in millionsTotal Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 YearsRECORDED LIABILITIES Total debt$30,185 $11,985 $3,403 $4,276 $10,521Capital leases52 20 23 7 2Uncertain tax positions (1)445 445 — — —OTHER Interest payments relating to long-term debt6,925 699 1,277 1,017 3,932Operating leases (2)1,617 249 435 371 562Minimum pension funding (3)656 215 441 — —Purchase obligations (4)1,507 586 449 242 230TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS$41,387 $14,199 $6,028 $5,913 $15,247(1) As of June 30, 2015, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $1.5 billion, including $366 million of interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of June 30, 2015, cannot be made.(2) Operating lease obligations are shown net of guaranteed sublease income.(3) Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2018 are not currently determinable.(4) Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent future purchases in line with expected usage to obtain favorable pricing. This includes service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.The Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, and our ability to uphold certain tax positions.Realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the The Procter & Gamble Company 38progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. For additional details on the Company's income taxes, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Employee BenefitsWe sponsor various post-employment benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense, since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPEB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2015, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPEB assets was 7.2% and 8.3%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPEB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $101 million.Since pension and OPEB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans of 3.1% and 4.5%, respectively, represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100-basis point change in the pension discount rate would impact annual after-tax defined benefit pension expense by approximately $195 million. A change in the OPEB discount rate of 100 basis points would impact annual after-tax OPEB expense by approximately $60 million. For additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsSignificant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain.We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants, and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, economic barriers to entry, a brand's relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are primarily based on these same factors. All of our acquired technology and customer-related intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives.The costs of determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. We 39 The Procter & Gamble Companytest goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the book values of each asset to the estimated fair value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. With the exception of our Appliances and Batteries businesses, all of our reporting units have fair values that significantly exceed recorded values. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. In addition, any potential change in the strategic plans for these businesses due to the refocusing of our business portfolio could impact these judgments, assumptions and estimates, in turn, impacting our fair value. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect the financial statements in any given year. The recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets from recently impaired businesses and recently acquired businesses are derived from more recent business operating plans and macroeconomic environmental conditions and therefore are more susceptible to an adverse change that could require an impairment charge.Prior to 2013, our Appliances reporting unit incurred an impairment charge to reduce the goodwill carrying amount to its estimated fair value. During 2013, the estimated fair value of our Appliances reporting unit declined further, below the carrying amount resulting from the prior impairment. Therefore, we recorded an additional non-cash before and after-tax impairment charge of $259 million in fiscal 2013. Additionally, our 2013 impairment testing for Appliances indicated a decline in the fair value of our Braun trade name intangible asset below its carrying value. This resulted in a non-cash, before-tax impairment charge of $49 million ($31 million after-tax) to reduce the carrying amount of this asset to its estimated fair value. The impairment of the Appliances business in fiscal 2013 was due to the devaluation of currency in Japan, a key country that generates a significant portion of the earnings of the Appliances business, relative to the currencies in which the underlying net assets are recorded.As of June 30, 2015, the Appliances business has remaining goodwill of $299 million and remaining intangible assets of $706 million. As a result of the impairments, the estimated fair value of our Appliances business slightly exceeds its respective carrying value. Our 2015 valuation of the Appliances business has it returning to sales and earnings growth rates consistent with our long-term business plans. However, the currency in Japan has continued to devalue relative to the currencies in which the related assets are recorded, reducing the fair value cushion in the Appliances business to approximately 5%.During 2015, we determined that the estimated fair value of our Batteries reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, resulting in a series of impairment charges. The underlying fair value assessment was initially triggered by an agreement in September 2014 to sell the China-based battery joint venture and a related decision to pursue options to exit the remainder of the Batteries business. The results of our annual goodwill impairment testing during fiscal 2014 had indicated a decline in the fair value of the Batteries reporting unit due to lower long-term market growth assumptions in certain key geographies. At that time, the estimated fair value of the Batteries business continued to exceed its underlying carrying value, but the fair value cushion had been reduced to about 5%. The agreement to sell the China-based battery joint venture was at a transaction value that was below the earnings multiple implied from the prior valuation of our Batteries business, which effectively eliminated our fair value cushion. As a result, the remaining business unit cash flows no longer supported the remaining carrying amount of the Batteries business. Due largely to these factors, we recorded an initial non-cash, before and after-tax impairment charge of $863 million to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill for the Batteries business unit to its estimated fair value. These same factors resulted in a decline in the fair value of our Duracell trade name intangible asset below its carrying value. This resulted in a non-cash, before-tax impairment charge of $110 million ($69 million after tax) to reduce the carrying amount of this asset to its estimated fair value. In November 2014, the Company reached an agreement to divest the remaining Batteries business via a split transaction in which the Company will exchange a recapitalized Duracell Company for Berkshire Hathaway's (BH) shares of P&G stock (see Note 13). Based on the terms of the agreement and the value of BH's shares of P&G stock at the agreement date, and changes thereto through June 30, 2015, the Company recorded additional non-cash, before and after-tax impairment charges totaling $1.2 billion. All of the fiscal 2015 impairment charges in the Batteries business are included as part of discontinued operations.The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. Changes to or a failure to achieve these business plans or a further deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions could result in a valuation that would trigger an additional impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses. In addition, we also The Procter & Gamble Company 40considered the structure and value of the divestiture agreement with BH in the impairment testing for Batteries. If the value of BH’s shares of the Company declines further before the transaction closing dates, we may need to record additional non-cash impairment charges as part of discontinued operations in the future.See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing results.New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of June 30, 2015.OTHER INFORMATIONHedging and Derivative Financial InstrumentsAs a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. Except within financing operations, we leverage the Company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes a detailed discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments.Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the CorporateManager™ value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics™ dataset as of June 30, 2015. In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics™, a reasonable proxy is included.Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term. Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments.Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June 30, 2015, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements.Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use forward contracts with maturities of less than 18 months. In addition, we enter into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions.Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2015, we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements.Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures.As of and during the years ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014, we did not have any commodity hedging activity.Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAPOur discussion of financial results includes several ""non-GAAP"" financial measures. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. When used in the MD&A, we have provided the comparable U.S. GAAP measure in the discussion. These measures include:Organic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this provides investors with a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Organic sales is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation.41 The Procter & Gamble CompanyThe following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth:Year ended June 30, 2015Net Sales GrowthForeign Exchange ImpactAcquisition/Divestiture Impact*Organic Sales GrowthBeauty, Hair and Personal Care(7)%5%1 %(1)%Grooming(7)%8%0 %1 %Health Care(1)%5%0 %4 %Fabric Care and Home Care(5)%6%1 %2 %Baby, Feminine and Family Care(3)%6%0 %3 %TOTAL COMPANY(5)%6%0 %1 % Year ended June 30, 2014Net Sales GrowthForeign Exchange ImpactAcquisition/Divestiture Impact*Organic Sales GrowthBeauty, Hair and Personal Care(2)%2%0 %0 %Grooming0 %3%0 %3 %Health Care1 %1%0 %2 %Fabric Care and Home Care0 %3%1 %4 %Baby, Feminine and Family Care2 %3%(1)%4 %TOTAL COMPANY0 %3%0 %3 %*Acquisition/Divestiture Impact includes rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales.Core EPS. This is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. This includes:•charges in each period presented for 1) incremental restructuring due to increased focus on productivity and cost savings, 2) the impacts from foreign exchange policy changes and the devaluations of the official foreign currency exchange rate in Venezuela, and 3) for certain European legal matters; •a holding gain in 2013 on the purchase of the balance of our Iberian joint venture; •impairment charges in 2013 for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets; and •a charge in 2015 for the Venezuelan deconsolidation. We do not view these items to be part of our sustainable results. We believe the Core EPS measure provides an important perspective of underlying business trends and results and provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year earnings per share growth. Core EPS is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. The table below provides a reconciliation of reported diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to Core EPS:Years ended June 30201520142013Diluted net earnings per share - continuing operations$3.06$3.86$3.71Incremental restructuring charges0.200.120.17Venezuela balance sheet devaluation impacts0.040.090.08Charges for European legal matters0.010.020.05Gain on purchase of balance of Iberian JV——(0.21)Impairment charges——0.10Venezuelan deconsolidation0.71——Rounding——(0.01)CORE EPS$4.02$4.09$3.89Core EPS Growth(2)%5%6%Note - All reconciling items are presented net of tax. Tax effects are calculated consistent with the nature of the underlying transaction. Adjusted Free Cash Flow. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding certain divestiture impacts (tax payments in the current year for the Pet Care divestiture). We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. Adjusted free cash flow is also one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow ($ millions): OperatingCash FlowCapitalSpendingFreeCash FlowCash Tax Payment - Pet Care SaleAdjusted FreeCash Flow2015$14,608$(3,736)$10,872$729$11,601201413,958(3,848)10,110—10,110201314,873(4,008)10,865—10,865Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity.

The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections:•Overview•Summary of 2016 Results •Economic Conditions and Uncertainties•Results of Operations•Segment Results•Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity•Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates•Other InformationThroughout the MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of the Venezuela deconsolidation, acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending and certain divestiture impacts. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding certain one-time items. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures.Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category.OVERVIEWP&G is a global leader in fast-moving consumer goods, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.12 The Procter & Gamble CompanyORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTUREOur organizational structure is comprised of Global Business Units (GBUs), Selling and Market Operations (SMOs), Global Business Services (GBS) and Corporate Functions (CF).Global Business UnitsOur GBUs are organized into ten product categories. Under U.S. GAAP, the GBUs underlying the ten product categories are aggregated into five reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric & Home Care; and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. The GBUs are responsible for developing overall brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovations and marketing plans. The following provides additional detail on our reportable segments and the ten product categories and brand composition within each segment.

Recent Developments: As of June 30, 2015, the Company deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting. This change resulted in a fiscal 2015 one-time after-tax charge of $2.1 billion ($0.71 per share). Beginning in fiscal 2016, our financial results only include sales of finished goods to our Venezuelan subsidiaries to the extent we receive cash payments from Venezuela (expected to be largely through the DIPRO and DICOM exchange market). Accordingly, we no longer include the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries' operations in reporting periods following fiscal 2015 (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and additional discussion in the MD&A under ""Venezuela Impacts"" in Results of Operations). In August 2014, the Company announced a plan to significantly streamline our product portfolio by divesting, discontinuing or consolidating about 100 non-strategic brands. The resulting portfolio of about 65 key brands are in 10 category-based businesses where P&G has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies. During fiscal 2016, the company completed the divestiture of its Batteries business. The Batteries business had historically been part of the Company’s Fabric & Home Care reportable segment. The results of the Batteries business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Additionally, the Batteries balance sheet positions as of June 30, 2015 are presented as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.On July 9, 2015, the Company announced the signing of a definitive agreement to divest four product categories, to Coty Inc. (""Coty""). Coty's offer was $12.5 billion. The divestiture was initially comprised of 43 of the Company's beauty brands (""Beauty Brands""), including the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. Subsequent to signing, two of the fine fragrance brands, Dolce Gabbana and Christina Aguilera, were excluded from the divestiture. While the ultimate form of the transaction has not yet been decided, the Company’s current preference is for a Reverse The Procter & Gamble Company 13Morris Trust split-off transaction in which P&G shareholders could elect to participate in an exchange offer to exchange their P&G shares for Coty shares. The Company expects to complete this transaction in October 2016. The results of the Beauty Brands are now presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Additionally, the Beauty Brands' balance sheet positions as of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 are presented as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.During fiscal 2015, the Company completed the divestiture of its Pet Care business. The gain on the transaction was not material. The results of the Pet Care business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. With these transactions and other recent minor brand divestitures, the Company will have substantially completed the strategic portfolio reshaping program.Beauty: We are a global market leader in the beauty category. Most of the beauty markets in which we compete are highly fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. We compete in skin and personal care and in hair care. In skin and personal care, we offer a wide variety of products, ranging from deodorants to personal cleansing to skin care, such as our Olay brand, which is one of the top facial skin care brands in the world with over 7% global market share. In hair care, we compete in the retail channel. We are the global market leader in the retail hair care market with over 20% global market share primarily behind our Pantene and Head & Shoulders brands. Grooming: We compete in Shave Care and Appliances. In Shave Care, we are the global market leader in the blades and razors market. Our global blades and razors market share is nearly 65%, primarily behind the Gillette franchise including Fusion, Mach3, Prestobarba and Venus. Our appliances, such as electric razors and epilators, are sold under the Braun brand in a number of markets around the world where we compete against both global and regional competitors. We hold over 20% of the male shavers market and nearly 45% of the female epilators market.Health Care: We compete in oral care and personal health care. In oral care, there are several global competitors in the market and we have the number two market share position with nearly 20% global market share behind our Oral-B and Crest brands. In personal health care, we are a top ten competitor in a large, highly fragmented industry, primarily behind respiratory treatments (Vicks brand), nonprescription heartburn medications (Prilosec OTC brand) and digestive wellness products (Metamucil, Pepto Bismol, and Align brands). Nearly all of our sales outside the U.S. in personal health care are generated through the PGT Healthcare partnership with Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Fabric & Home Care: This segment is comprised of a variety of fabric care products including laundry detergents, additives and fabric enhancers; and home care products including dishwashing liquids and detergents, surface cleaners and air fresheners. In fabric care, we generally have the number one or number two market share position in the markets in which we compete and are the global market leader with nearly 30% global market share, primarily behind our Tide, Ariel and Downy brands. Our global home care market share is nearly 25% across the categories in which we compete.Baby, Feminine & Family Care: In baby care, we compete mainly in diapers, pants and baby wipes with nearly 30% global market share. We are the number one or number two baby care competitor in most of the key markets in which we compete, primarily behind Pampers, the Company's largest brand, with annual net sales of nearly $9 billion. We are the global market leader in the feminine care category with over 25% global market share, primarily behind Always. We also compete in the adult incontinence category in certain markets, achieving over 10% market share in the markets where we compete. Our family care business is predominantly a North American business comprised largely of the Bounty paper towel and Charmin toilet paper brands. U.S. market shares are over 40% for Bounty and over 25% for Charmin.Selling and Market OperationsOur SMOs are responsible for developing and executing go-to-market plans at the local level. The SMOs include dedicated retail customer, trade channel and country-specific teams. Our SMOs are organized under six regions comprised of North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Greater China and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA). Throughout the MD&A, we reference business results in developed markets, which are comprised of North America, Western Europe and Japan, and developing markets which are all other markets not included in developed. Global Business ServicesGBS provides technology, processes and standard data tools to enable the GBUs and the SMOs to better understand the business and better serve consumers and customers. The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class solutions at a low cost and with minimal capital investment.Corporate FunctionsCF provides company-level strategy and portfolio analysis, corporate accounting, treasury, tax, external relations, governance, human resources and legal, as well as other centralized functional support.STRATEGIC FOCUSP&G aspires to serve the world’s consumers better than our best competitors in every category and in every country in which we compete, and, as a result, deliver total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. Delivering and sustaining leadership levels of shareholder value creation requires balanced top-line growth, bottom-line growth and strong cash generation.Our strategic choices are focused on winning with consumers. The consumers who purchase and use our products are at the center of everything we do. We increase the number of users - and the usage - of our brands when we win at the zero, first and second moments of truth: when consumers research our 14 The Procter & Gamble Companycategories and brands, purchase them in a store or online and use them in their homes.Winning with consumers around the world and against our best competitors requires innovation. Innovation has always been, and continues to be, P&G’s lifeblood. Innovation requires consumer insights and technology advancements that lead to product improvements, improved marketing and merchandising programs and game-changing inventions that create new brands and categories. Productivity improvement is critical to delivering our balanced top-line growth, bottom-line growth and value creation objectives. Productivity improvement and sales growth reinforce and fuel each other. We are driving productivity improvement across all elements of cost, including cost of goods sold, marketing and promotional expenses and non-manufacturing overhead. Productivity improvements and cost savings are being reinvested in product and packaging improvements, brand awareness-building advertising and trial-building sampling programs, increased sales coverage and R&D programs.We are improving operational effectiveness and organizational culture through enhanced clarity of roles and responsibilities, accountability and incentive compensation programs. The Company has undertaken an effort to focus and strengthen its business portfolio to compete in categories and with brands that are structurally attractive and that play to P&G's strengths. The ongoing portfolio of businesses consists of 10 product categories. These are categories where P&G has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies.We believe these strategies are right for the long-term health of the Company and our objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group.The Company expects the delivery of the following long-term annual financial targets will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive peer group:•Organic sales growth above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete;•Core EPS growth of mid-to-high single digits; and•Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater.In periods with significant macroeconomic pressures, we intend to maintain a disciplined approach to investing so as not to sacrifice the long-term health of our businesses to meet short-term objectives in any given year.SUMMARY OF 2016 RESULTSAmounts in millions, except per share amounts2016 Change vs. Prior Year 2015 Change vs. Prior Year 2014Net sales$65,299 (8)% $70,749 (5)% $74,401Operating income13,441 22 % 11,049 (21)% 13,910Net earnings from continuing operations10,027 21 % 8,287 (22)% 10,658Net earnings/(loss) from discontinued operations577 N/A (1,143) N/A 1,127Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble10,508 49 % 7,036 (40)% 11,643Diluted net earnings per common share3.69 51 % 2.44 (39)% 4.01Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations3.49 23 % 2.84 (22)% 3.63Core EPS3.67 (2)% 3.76 (2)% 3.85Cash flow from operating activities15,435 6 % 14,608 5 % 13,958•Net sales decreased 8% to $65.3 billion including a negative 6% impact from foreign exchange.◦Organic sales increased 1%, as increased pricing was partially offset by a reduction in organic volume.◦Unit volume decreased 3%.

Foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings from continuing operations by $880 million or approximately 11%. •Net earnings from discontinued operations increased $1.7 billion due primarily to the net impact of a gain on the sale of our Batteries business in fiscal 2016 and higher impairment charges on that business in the prior period.•Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $10.5 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion or 49% versus the prior year due to the aforementioned increases in net earnings from both continuing and discontinued operations.•Diluted net earnings per share increased 51% to $3.69.◦Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 23% to $3.49.◦Core EPS decreased 2% to $3.67.•Cash flow from operating activities was $15.4 billion.◦Adjusted free cash flow was $12.1 billion.◦Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 115%.The Procter & Gamble Company 15ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIESWe discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are ""forward-looking statements"" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors in this Form 10-K.Global Economic Conditions. Current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-producing economies as commodity prices decline, greater political unrest in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, further economic instability in the European Union, political instability in certain Latin American markets and economic slowdowns in Japan and China, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our earnings.Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. If we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings. Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. As discussed later in the MD&A, we initiated certain non-manufacturing overhead reduction projects along with manufacturing and other supply chain cost improvements projects in 2012. If we are not successful in executing these changes, there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings.Foreign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, Mexico, Nigeria, Russia and Turkey have had, and could have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings. Increased pricing in response to these fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts, but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales.Government Policies. Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies. For example, the U.S. may consider corporate tax reform that could significantly impact the corporate tax rate and change the U.S. tax treatment of international earnings. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt and currency exposure in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria and Ukraine. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, operating margin and net earnings. RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative costs (SG&A), other non-operating items and income taxes. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, the level of initiatives and other activities by competitors, geographic expansion and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as pricing actions (which can also indirectly impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the U.S.Most of our cost of products sold and SG&A are to some extent variable in nature. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and to a lesser extent scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary drivers of SG&A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. Overhead costs are also variable in nature, but on a relative basis, less so than marketing costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth. Accordingly, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs. 16 The Procter & Gamble CompanyThe Company is in the midst of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, marketing and overhead expenses. The plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. Net SalesFiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 Net sales decreased 8% to $65.3 billion in 2016 on a 3% decrease in unit volume versus the prior year period. Volume decreased low single digits in Grooming, Health Care, Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care and decreased mid-single digits in Beauty. Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and declined high single digits in developing regions, in part due to increased pricing to address foreign exchange devaluations and due to the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures. Organic volume declined mid-single digits in developing markets. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 6%, while higher pricing drove a 1% favorable impact on net sales. Organic volume decreased 1% and organic sales grew 1% driven by higher pricing.Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 Net sales decreased 5% to $70.7 billion in 2015 on a 1% decrease in unit volume versus the prior year period. Volume grew low single digits in Fabric & Home Care. Volume decreased low single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care, Grooming, Health Care and Beauty. Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and declined low single digits in developing regions due, in part, to increased pricing to address foreign exchange devaluations. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 6%, while higher pricing drove a 2% favorable impact on net sales. Favorable product mix impact of 1% was offset by acquisition and divestiture activity.

These impacts were partially offset by: •a 70 basis point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange, •a 70 basis point decrease due to unfavorable product mix caused by the disproportionate decline of higher margin segments like Beauty and by product form mix within the segments, •a 20 basis point decrease from negative scale impacts due to lower volume and•a 20 basis point decline due to incremental restructuring activity.Total SG&A decreased 8% to $18.9 billion primarily due to reduced overhead spending and a decrease in foreign exchange transaction charges. SG&A as a percentage of net sales declined 10 basis points to 29.0%, as the negative scale impacts of lower net sales and inflationary impacts were more than offset by cost savings efforts, mainly in overhead spending, and lower foreign exchange transactional charges. •Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 90 basis points due to the negative scale impacts from reduced sales. •Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points, as 90 basis points of productivity savings were partially offset by wage inflation, increased sales personnel in certain businesses, investments in research and development and the negative scale impacts from reduced sales. •Lower foreign exchange transactional charges reduced SG&A as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70 basis points. A pre-deconsolidation balance sheet remeasurement charge in Venezuela in the base period drove 20 basis points of this decline. The balance of the reduction relates to lower transactional charges from revaluing receivables and payables from transactions denominated in a currency other than a local entity’s functional currency.The Procter & Gamble Company 17Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 Gross margin increased 10 basis points to 47.6% of net sales in 2015. Gross margin benefited from:•a 200 basis point impact from manufacturing cost savings and •a 90 basis point benefit from higher pricing. These impacts were partially offset by:•a 110 basis point impact from unfavorable geographic and product mix, primarily from declines in the higher than average margin Beauty and Grooming segments as well as within the Fabric & Home Care and Grooming segments,•a 50 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign exchange, •a 40 basis point impact from costs related to initiatives and capacity investments, •a 30 basis point impact from higher restructuring costs and •smaller impacts from lower volume scale and higher commodity costs.Total SG&A decreased 4% to $20.6 billion, as reduced overhead and marketing spending was partially offset by increased foreign exchange transaction charges. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points to 29.1%, as the negative scale impacts of lower net sales and inflationary impacts were partially offset by cost savings efforts. •Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 60 basis points behind lower spending due to efficiency efforts. •Overhead spending as a percentage of net sales increased 50 basis points as productivity savings of 60 basis points from reduced overhead spending were more than offset by wage inflation, investments in research and development, the negative scale impacts of lower net sales and higher restructuring costs. •Increased foreign exchange transaction charges added approximately 40 basis points to SG&A as a percentage of net sales, as current year foreign currency transaction charges (from revaluing receivables and payables denominated in a currency other than a local entity’s functional currency) were partially offset by lower year-on-year charges for Venezuela remeasurement and devaluation.During fiscal 2015, the Company incurred a $2.0 billion ($2.1 billion after tax) charge related to the deconsolidation of its Venezuelan subsidiaries. See the “Venezuela Impacts” later in the Results of Operations section.Non-Operating ItemsFiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 •Interest expense was $579 million in 2016, a decrease of $47 million versus the prior year due to lower average debt balances. •Interest income was $182 million in 2016, an increase of $33 million versus the prior year primarily due to increasing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities balances. •Other non-operating income, which primarily includes divestiture gains and investment income, decreased $115 million to $325 million, due primarily to lower gains on minor brand divestitures. In 2016, we had approximately $300 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Escudo and certain hair care brands in Europe and IMEA. The prior year acquisition and divestiture activities included approximately $450 million in divestiture gains, including Zest, Camay, Fekkai and Wash & Go hair care brands and Vaposteam.Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 •Interest expense was $626 million in 2015 a decrease of $83 million versus the prior year due to lower average debt balances and a decrease in weighted average interest rates. •Interest income was $149 million in 2015, an increase of $50 million versus the prior year due to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. •Other non-operating income increased $231 million to $440 million, primarily due to minor brand divestiture gains. In 2015, we had approximately $450 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Zest, Camay, Fekkai and Wash & Go hair care brands and Vaposteam. The prior year acquisition and divestiture activities included approximately $150 million in divestiture gains, primarily related to the sale of our bleach businesses in Europe, IMEA and Latin America, our Pert hair care business in Latin America and MDVIP.Income TaxesFiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 30 basis points to 25.0% in 2016 mainly due to a 260 basis point negative impact from the unfavorable geographic mix of earnings, a 130 basis point impact in the current year from the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and the impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions (which netted to 55 basis points in the current year versus 85 basis points in the prior year), partially offset by a 400 basis point decrease related to the prior year non-deductibility of the Venezuelan deconsolidation charge.Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 360 basis points to 24.7% in 2015 mainly due to the non-deductibility of the $2.0 billion Venezuelan deconsolidation charge. The rate increase caused by lower favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions (the net benefit was 80 basis points in fiscal 2015 versus 170 basis points in fiscal 2014) was largely offset by a decrease related to favorable geographic earnings mix.Net EarningsFiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 Net earnings from continuing operations increased $1.7 billion or 21% to $10.0 billion primarily due to the base period charge of $2.1 billion after-tax related to the deconsolidation of 18 The Procter & Gamble CompanyVenezuelan subsidiaries. Earnings also declined due to the impact of the decline in net sales in fiscal 2016, partially offset by improved gross margin and the reduction in SG&A. Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by about $880 million in 2016 due to weakening of certain key currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and Russia. This impact includes both transactional charges as discussed above in Operating Costs and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.Net earnings from discontinued operations improved $1.7 billion in 2016 to $577 million. Batteries drove a $2.1 billion improvement due primarily to a $1.8 billion reduction in after-tax impairment charges in the Batteries business ($350 million in the current year compared to $2.1 billion in the base period) and a $422 million after-tax gain in the current period from the sale of the Batteries business. This was partially offset by a decrease in the earnings of the Beauty Brands (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $3.5 billion, or 49% to $10.5 billion.Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.65, or 23%, to $3.49 due to the increase in net earnings and a decline in the average number of shares outstanding. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.20 primarily resulting from the gain on the sale of the Batteries business. This was an improvement of $0.60 per share versus the prior year. Diluted net earnings per share increased $1.25, or 51%, to $3.69.Core EPS decreased 2% to $3.67. Core EPS in fiscal year 2016 represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges for certain European legal matters and incremental restructuring related to our productivity and cost savings plan. The decline was driven by reduced net sales and foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by gross margin expansion.Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 Net earnings from continuing operations decreased $2.4 billion or 22% to $8.3 billion due to the $2.1 billion after-tax charge related to the deconsolidation of Venezuelan subsidiaries and the decline in net sales, partially offset by reduced SG&A. Foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings by approximately $1.3 billion in 2015 due to the weakening of certain key currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily in Russia, Ukraine, Venezuela and Argentina, partially offset by lower after-tax charges related to balance sheet remeasurement charges in Venezuela. Net earnings from discontinued operations decreased $2.3 billion in 2015 due primarily to $2.1 billion of after-tax impairment charges in our Batteries business (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and the absence of fiscal 2015 earnings from our divested Pet Care business. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased $4.6 billion, or 40% to $7.0 billion.Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations decreased $0.79, or 22%, to $2.84 due to the decrease in net earnings. We had a diluted net loss per share from discontinued operations of $0.40 due primarily to the impairment charges on the Batteries business. This was a reduction of $0.78 per share versus the prior year. Diluted net earnings per share decreased $1.57, or 39%, to $2.44.Core EPS decreased 2% to $3.76. Core EPS represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges for Venezuelan deconsolidation, balance sheet remeasurement charges from foreign exchange policy changes and devaluation in Venezuela, charges for certain European legal matters and incremental restructuring related to our productivity and cost savings plan. The decline was driven by reduced net sales, partially offset by minor brand divestiture gains. Venezuela ImpactsThere are a number of currency and other operating controls and restrictions in Venezuela, which have evolved over time and may continue to evolve in the future. These evolving conditions resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar and restricted our Venezuelan operations’ ability to pay dividends or pay for certain raw and package materials, finished goods and services denominated in U.S. dollars. For accounting purposes, this resulted in a lack of control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Therefore, in accordance with the applicable accounting standards for consolidation, effective June 30, 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting. This resulted in a write-off of all of the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiaries, along with Venezuela related assets held by other subsidiaries. Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2016, our financial results only include sales of finished goods to our Venezuelan subsidiaries to the extent we receive payments from Venezuela. Accordingly, we no longer include the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries’ operations in our financial results. The Procter & Gamble Company 19SEGMENT RESULTSSegment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. The results of these reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs such as interest expense, investing activities and certain restructuring and asset impairment costs. These costs are reported in our Corporate segment and are included as part of our Corporate segment discussion. Additionally, as described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we apply blended statutory tax rates in the segments. Eliminations to adjust segment results to arrive at our effective tax rate are included in Corporate. All references to net earnings throughout the discussion of segment results refer to net earnings from continuing operations.Net Sales Change Drivers 2016 vs. 2015* Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume Excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Foreign Exchange Price Mix Other** Net Sales GrowthBeauty(5)% (2)% (6)% 2% — % —% (9)%Grooming(2)% (2)% (9)% 5% (2)% —% (8)%Health Care(2)% (2)% (6)% 2% 1 % —% (5)%Fabric & Home Care(1)% 1 % (6)% —% — % —% (7)%Baby, Feminine & Family Care(3)% (2)% (6)% —% — % —% (9)%TOTAL COMPANY(3)% (1)% (6)% 1% — % —% (8)% Net Sales Change Drivers 2015 vs. 2014* Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume Excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Foreign Exchange Price Mix Other** Net Sales GrowthBeauty(3)% (2)% (5)% 2% —% — % (6)%Grooming(3)% (3)% (8)% 4% —% — % (7)%Health Care(1)% (1)% (5)% 2% 3% — % (1)%Fabric & Home Care1 % 1 % (6)% 1% —% (1)% (5)%Baby, Feminine & Family Care(1)% (1)% (6)% 2% 2% — % (3)%TOTAL COMPANY(1)% (1)% (6)% 2% 1% (1)% (5)%* Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. ** Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales.BEAUTY($ millions)2016 Change vs. 2015 2015 Change vs. 2014VolumeN/A (5)% N/A (3)%Net sales$11,477 (9)% $12,608 (6)%Net earnings$1,975 (9)% $2,181 (5)%% of net sales17.2% (10) bps 17.3% 10 bpsFiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 Beauty net sales decreased 9% to $11.5 billion during the fiscal year on a 5% decrease in unit volume.

The most significant reconciling item includes income taxes to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate.Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015Corporate net sales decreased $44 million during the fiscal year. Corporate net earnings from continuing operations improved by approximately $2.2 billion during the fiscal year, primarily due to the $2.1 billion Venezuela deconsolidation charge in the prior fiscal year and lower foreign currency transactional charges. Additional discussion of these items impacting net earnings in Corporate are included in the Results of Operations section.Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014Net sales in Corporate decreased by $271 million in 2015 primarily due to the prior year divestiture of the MDVIP business. Corporate net expenses from continuing operations increased $2.0 billion in 2015, primarily due to the charge related to the deconsolidation of the Venezuelan subsidiaries, increased foreign exchange transactional charges and incremental restructuring charges, which were partially offset by gains on minor brand divestitures. Productivity and Cost Savings PlanIn 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy.As part of this plan, the Company expects to incur approximately $5.5 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a six-year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017). Through the end of fiscal 2016, 89% of the expected costs have been incurred. Savings generated from the restructuring costs are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. Overall, these costs and other non-manufacturing enrollment reductions are expected to deliver approximately $3.0 billion in annual before-tax gross savings. The cumulative before-tax savings realized through 2016 were approximately $2.4 billion.Restructuring accruals of $315 million as of June 30, 2016 are classified as current liabilities. During fiscal 2016, 51% of the restructuring charges incurred either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting.In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins.Refer to Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program and to the Operating Costs section of the MD&A for more information about the total benefit to operating margins from our total savings efforts.CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates.Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.Operating Cash FlowFiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 Operating cash flow was $15.4 billion in 2016, a 6% increase from the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes, loss/(gain) on sale of businesses and impairment charges) generated $13.6 billion of operating cash 24 The Procter & Gamble Companyflow. Working capital and other impacts generated $1.8 billion of operating cash flow. •Reduced accounts receivable generated $35 million of cash due to improved collection results partially offset by sales mix. The number of days sales outstanding increased 1 day due to foreign exchange impacts. •Lower inventory generated $116 million of cash mainly due to supply chain optimizations and lower commodity costs. Inventory days on hand increased 4 days primarily due to foreign exchange impacts. •Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $1.3 billion in operating cash flow, of which approximately $0.8 billion was driven by extended payment terms with our suppliers. The balance was primarily driven by an increase in fourth quarter marketing activity versus the prior year. These items, along with the impact of foreign exchange, drove a 24 day increase in days payable outstanding. Although difficult to project due to market and other dynamics, we anticipate similar cash flow benefits from the extended payment terms with suppliers over the next fiscal year. •Other operating assets and liabilities generated $204 million of cash.Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 Operating cash flow was $14.6 billion in 2015, a 5% increase from the prior year. Operating cash flows resulted primarily from net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes, impairment charges, gains on sale of businesses and the Venezuela deconsolidation charge) and a decrease in working capital, partially offset by the impact of other operating assets and liabilities. •Reduced accounts receivable generated $349 million of cash due to changes in customer terms and improved collection results. The number of days sales outstanding decreased 5 days due to foreign exchange impacts and improvements in collection results and customer terms. •Lower inventory generated $313 million of cash mainly due to supply chain optimizations and lower commodity costs. Inventory days on hand decreased 7 days due to foreign exchange impacts, supply chain optimizations and lower commodity costs. •Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $928 million in operating cash flow primarily driven by extended payment terms. •Other operating assets and liabilities utilized $976 million of cash primarily due to the elimination of the deferred tax impacts associated with the Pet Care divestiture.Adjusted Free Cash Flow. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding certain divestiture impacts (tax payments in the prior year for the Pet Care divestiture) and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation. Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 Adjusted free cash flow was $12.1 billion in 2016, an increase of 4% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by the increase in operating cash flows and decrease in capital spending. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the impairment charges and gain on the sale of the Batteries business, was 115% in 2016. Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 Adjusted free cash flow was $11.6 billion in 2015, an increase of 15% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by the increase in operating cash flows. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding impairment charges on the Batteries business and the Venezuelan deconsolidation charge, was 102% in 2015. Investing Cash FlowFiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 Net investing activities consumed $5.6 billion in cash in 2016 mainly due to capital spending, divestiture transactions and net purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by sales or maturities of short-term investments. Fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal year 2014 Net investing activities consumed $2.9 billion in cash in 2015 mainly due to capital spending, net purchases of available-for-sale securities and a reduction in cash due to Venezuela deconsolidation, partially offset by asset sales. Capital Spending. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost efficiencies, were $3.3 billion in 2016 and $3.7 billion in 2015. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points to 5.1% in 2016. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales was 5.3% in 2015.Acquisitions. Acquisition activity was not material in 2016 or 2015. Proceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales in 2016 contributed $432 million in cash, primarily from plant asset sales and other minor brand divestitures. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $4.5 billion in cash in 2015 primarily from the sale of our Pet Care business, the sale of our Chinese battery venture, and other minor brand divestitures.Financing Cash FlowDividend Payments. Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments. Dividends per common share increased 3% to $2.66 per share in 2016. Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $7.4 billion in 2016 and $7.3 billion in 2015. In April 2016, the Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.6629 to $0.6695 per share on Common Stock and Series A and B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock. This represents a 1% increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 60th consecutive year that our dividend has increased. We The Procter & Gamble Company 25have paid a dividend for 126 years, every year since our incorporation in 1890.Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $30.6 billion as of June 30, 2016 and $30.3 billion as of June 30, 2015. Treasury Purchases. Total share repurchases were $4.0 billion in 2016 and $4.6 billion in 2015. In addition, the cash infusion of $1.7 billion in the Batteries divestiture was reflected as a purchase of treasury stock.LiquidityAt June 30, 2016, our current assets exceeded current liabilities by $3.0 billion largely due to current assets and current liabilities of the Beauty Brands business held for sale. Excluding current assets and current liabilities of the Beauty Brands business held for sale, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $1.8 billion, largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. As of June 30, 2016, $11.0 billion of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities is held off-shore by foreign subsidiaries. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. We do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future. Of the June 30, 2016 balance of off-shore cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, the majority relates to various Western European countries. As of June 30, 2016, we did not have material cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds. We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled, and should continue to enable, us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements.On June 30, 2016, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard & Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings were Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard & Poor's), all with a stable outlook.We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $8.0 billion facility split between a $3.2 billion five-year facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire in November 2020 and November 2016, respectively. The 364-day facility can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities. For additional details on debt see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity.26 The Procter & Gamble CompanyContractual CommitmentsThe following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2016.Amounts in millionsTotal Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 YearsRECORDED LIABILITIES Total debt$30,221 $11,635 $3,660 $3,467 $11,459Capital leases45 16 21 5 3Uncertain tax positions (1)247 247 — — —OTHER Interest payments relating to long-term debt6,439 684 1,249 979 3,527Operating leases (2)1,563 237 464 360 502Minimum pension funding (3)640 215 425 — —Purchase obligations (4)1,794 881 391 234 288TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS$40,949 $13,915 $6,210 $5,045 $15,779(1) As of June 30, 2016, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $1.2 billion, including $343 million of interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of June 30, 2016, cannot be made.(2) Operating lease obligations are shown net of guaranteed sublease income.(3) Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2019 are not currently determinable.(4) Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent future purchases in line with expected usage to obtain favorable pricing. This includes service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.The Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, and our ability to uphold certain tax positions.Realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.Our operating principles are that our tax structure is based on our business operating model, such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities. However, we may have income tax exposure related to the determination of the appropriate transfer prices The Procter & Gamble Company 27for our various cross-border transactions. We obtain advance rulings with tax authorities to support our positions, where possible, to help manage these exposures. Nonetheless, many of the underlying transactions are subject to audit, resulting in uncertainty until the ultimate audit resolution. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. For additional details on the Company's income taxes, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Employee BenefitsWe sponsor various post-employment benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense, since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPEB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2016, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPEB assets was 7.2% and 8.3%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPEB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $100 million. Since pension and OPEB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans of 2.1% and 3.6%, respectively, represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100 basis point change in the pension discount rate would impact annual after-tax defined benefit pension expense by approximately $200 million. A change in the OPEB discount rate of 100 basis points would impact annual after-tax OPEB expense by approximately $86 million. For additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsSignificant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain.We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants, and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, economic barriers to entry, a brand's relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangible assets are primarily based on these same factors. All of our acquired technology and customer-related intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives.28 The Procter & Gamble CompanyThe costs of determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. We test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the book values of each asset to the estimated fair value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our continuing goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high. While both of these wholly-acquired reporting units have fair value cushions that currently exceed the underlying carrying values, the Shave Care cushion, as well as certain of the related indefinite-lived intangible assets, have been reduced to below 20% due in large part to significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar that began in recent years and continued during fiscal 2016. As a result, this unit is more susceptible to impairment risk from adverse changes in business operating plans and macroeconomic environment conditions, including any further significant devaluation of major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Any such adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of the business unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles.The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. Changes to, or a failure to, achieve these business plans or a further deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions could result in a valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing results.New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of June 30, 2016.OTHER INFORMATIONHedging and Derivative Financial InstrumentsAs a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. Except within financing operations, we leverage the Company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments.Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the CorporateManager™ value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics™ dataset as of June 30, 2016. In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics™, a reasonable proxy is included.Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term.Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments.The Procter & Gamble Company 29Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June 30, 2016, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements.Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use forward contracts with maturities of less than 18 months. In addition, we enter into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions.Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2016, we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact on such instruments of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements.Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures.As of and during the years ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, we did not have any commodity hedging activity.Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAPOur discussion of financial results includes several ""non-GAAP"" financial measures. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business trends (i.e. trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. These measures include:Organic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of the Venezuela deconsolidation, acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis, and this measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.The following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth:Year ended June 30, 2016Net Sales GrowthForeign Exchange ImpactAcquisition/Divestiture Impact*Organic Sales GrowthBeauty(9)%6%3%— %Grooming(8)%9%1%2 %Health Care(5)%6%1%2 %Fabric & Home Care(7)%6%2%1 %Baby, Feminine & Family Care(9)%6%2%(1)%TOTAL COMPANY(8)%6%3%1 % Year ended June 30, 2015Net Sales GrowthForeign Exchange ImpactAcquisition/Divestiture Impact*Organic Sales GrowthBeauty(6)%5%1%— %Grooming(7)%8%—%1 %Health Care(1)%5%—%4 %Fabric & Home Care(5)%6%1%2 %Baby, Feminine & Family Care(3)%6%—%3 %TOTAL COMPANY(5)%6%1%2 %*Acquisition/Divestiture Impact also includes the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and the rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales.Core EPS. Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated. Management views these non-GAAP measures as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. The table below provides a reconciliation of revised diluted net earnings per share to Core EPS, including the following reconciling items:•Incremental restructuring: While the Company has and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities, beginning in 2012 we began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that includes incremental restructuring activities. This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings. The charges include only the incremental portion of the restructuring costs. •Venezuela deconsolidation charge: For accounting purposes, evolving conditions resulted in a lack of control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Therefore, in 30 The Procter & Gamble Companyaccordance with the applicable accounting standards for consolidation, effective June 30, 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting. The charge was incurred to write off our net assets related to Venezuela.•Charges for certain European legal matters: Several countries in Europe issued separate complaints alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in prior periods. The Company established Legal Reserves related to these charges. Management does not view these charges as indicative of underlying business results.•Venezuela Balance Sheet Remeasurement & Devaluation Impacts: Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. Prior to deconsolidation, the government enacted episodic changes to currency exchange mechanisms and rates, which resulted in currency remeasurement charges for non-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by our Venezuelan subsidiaries.We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results, and their exclusion from core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results.

Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending excluding tax payments related to the divestiture of the discontinued Pet business. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment.

Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding Batteries impairments, the gain on the sale of the Batteries business and Venezuela charges. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent.The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow productivity ($ millions): NetEarningsGain on Batteries Sale / Impairment & Decon- solidation ChargesNet Earnings Excluding Batteries Gain/Impairment & Deconsolid- ation ChargesAdjusted Free Cash FlowAdjusted FreeCash FlowProductivity2016$10,604$(72)$10,532$12,121115%20157,1444,18711,33111,601102%201411,785—11,78510,10086%Item 7A.

Forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise.The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections:•Overview•Summary of 2017 Results •Economic Conditions and Uncertainties•Results of Operations•Segment Results•Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity•Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates•Other InformationThroughout the MD&A we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of the Venezuela deconsolidation, acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending and certain divestiture impacts. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding certain one-time items. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures.Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-reported consumption and market size data, as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category.OVERVIEWP&G is a global leader in fast-moving consumer goods, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, e-commerce, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products, as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.12 The Procter & Gamble CompanyORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTUREOur organizational structure is comprised of Global Business Units (GBUs), Selling and Market Operations (SMOs), Global Business Services (GBS) and Corporate Functions (CF).Global Business UnitsOur GBUs are organized into ten product categories. Under U.S. GAAP, the GBUs underlying the ten product categories are aggregated into five reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric & Home Care; and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. The GBUs are responsible for developing overall brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovations and marketing plans. The following provides additional detail on our reportable segments and the ten product categories and brand composition within each segment.Reportable Segments% ofNet Sales (1)% of NetEarnings (1)Product Categories (Sub-Categories)Major BrandsBeauty18%19%Hair Care (Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments)Head & Shoulders, Pantene, RejoiceSkin and Personal Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care)Olay, Old Spice, Safeguard, SK-IIGrooming10%16%Grooming (2) (Shave Care - Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care; Appliances)Braun, Fusion, Gillette, Mach3, Prestobarba, VenusHealth Care12%13%Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care)Crest, Oral-BPersonal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care)Prilosec, VicksFabric & Home Care32%27%Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents)Ariel, Downy, Gain, TideHome Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care)Cascade, Dawn, Febreze, Mr. Clean, SwifferBaby, Feminine & Family Care28%25%Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants)Luvs, PampersFeminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care)Always, TampaxFamily Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper)Bounty, Charmin(1) Percent of Net sales and Net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2017 (excluding results held in Corporate).(2) The Grooming product category is comprised of the Shave Care and Appliances GBUs. Recent Developments: During fiscal 2017, the Company completed the previously announced plan to significantly streamline our product portfolio by divesting, discontinuing or consolidating about 100 non-strategic brands. The resulting portfolio of about 65 key brands are in 10 category-based businesses where P&G has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies. During fiscal 2017, the Company completed the divestiture of four product categories, which included 43 of the Company's beauty brands (""Beauty Brands""), including the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and the fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. The Beauty Brands had historically been part of the Company’s Beauty reportable segment. The results of the Beauty Brands are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Additionally, the Beauty Brands balance sheet positions as of June 30, 2016 are presented as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the final transaction of $5.3 billion ($1.95 per share), net of transaction and related costs. During fiscal 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of its Batteries business. The Batteries business had historically been part of the Company’s Fabric & Home Care reportable segment. The results of the Batteries business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. During fiscal 2015, the Company completed the divestiture of its Pet Care business. The gain on the transaction was not material. The results of the Pet Care business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Refer to Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on each of these divestiture transactions.While our ongoing business model may include a certain level of acquisition and divestiture activity, with the aforementioned transactions and other recent minor brand divestitures, the Company has completed the strategic portfolio reshaping program. The Procter & Gamble Company 13As of June 30, 2015, the Company deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting. This change resulted in a fiscal 2015 one-time after-tax charge of $2.1 billion ($0.71 per share). Beginning in fiscal 2016, our financial results only include sales of finished goods to our Venezuelan subsidiaries to the extent we receive cash payments from Venezuela (expected to be largely through the DIPRO and DICOM exchange market). Accordingly, we no longer include the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries' operations in reporting periods following fiscal 2015 (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and additional discussion in the MD&A under ""Venezuela Impacts"" in Results of Operations).Beauty: We are a global market leader in the beauty category. Most of the beauty markets in which we compete are highly fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. We compete in skin and personal care and in hair care. In skin and personal care, we offer a wide variety of products, ranging from deodorants to personal cleansing to skin care, such as our Olay brand, which is one of the top facial skin care brands in the world with nearly 6% global market share. We are the global market leader in the retail hair care market with over 20% global market share primarily behind our Pantene and Head & Shoulders brands. Grooming: We compete in Shave Care and Appliances. In Shave Care, we are the global market leader in the blades and razors market. Our global blades and razors market share is nearly 65%, primarily behind the Gillette franchise including our Fusion, Mach3, Prestobarba and Venus brands. Our appliances, such as electric razors and epilators, are sold under the Braun brand in a number of markets around the world where we compete against both global and regional competitors. We hold nearly 25% of the male shavers market and over 50% of the female epilators market.Health Care: We compete in oral care and personal health care. In oral care, there are several global competitors in the market and we have the number two market share position with nearly 20% global market share behind our Oral-B and Crest brands. In personal health care, we are a top ten competitor in a large, highly fragmented industry, primarily behind respiratory treatments (Vicks brand), non-prescription heartburn medications (Prilosec OTC brand) and digestive wellness products (Metamucil, Pepto Bismol, and Align brands). Nearly all of our sales outside the U.S. in personal health care are generated through the PGT Healthcare partnership with Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Fabric & Home Care: This segment is comprised of a variety of fabric care products including laundry detergents, additives and fabric enhancers; and home care products including dishwashing liquids and detergents, surface cleaners and air fresheners. In fabric care, we generally have the number one or number two market share position in the markets in which we compete and are the global market leader with over 25% global market share, primarily behind our Tide, Ariel and Downy brands. Our global home care market share is over 20% across the categories in which we compete. Baby, Feminine & Family Care: In baby care, we are the global market leader and compete mainly in diapers, pants and baby wipes with over 25% global market share. We are the number one or number two baby care competitor in most of the key markets in which we compete, primarily behind Pampers, the Company's largest brand, with annual net sales of more than $8 billion. We are the global market leader in the feminine care category with over 25% global market share, primarily behind Always. We also compete in the adult incontinence category in certain markets, achieving over 10% market share in the markets where we compete. Our family care business is predominantly a North American business comprised largely of the Bounty paper towel and Charmin toilet paper brands. U.S. market shares are over 40% for Bounty and over 25% for Charmin.Selling and Market OperationsOur SMOs are responsible for developing and executing go-to-market plans at the local level. The SMOs include dedicated retail customer, trade channel and country-specific teams. Our SMOs are organized under six regions comprised of North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Greater China and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA). Throughout the MD&A, we reference business results in developed markets, which are comprised of North America, Western Europe and Japan, and developing markets which are all other markets not included in developed. Corporate FunctionsCF provides company-level strategy and portfolio analysis, corporate accounting, treasury, tax, external relations, governance, human resources and legal, as well as other centralized functional support.Global Business ServicesGBS provides technology, processes and standard data tools to enable the GBUs, the SMOs and Corporate Functions to better understand the business and better serve consumers and customers. The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class solutions at a low cost and with minimal capital investment.STRATEGIC FOCUSP&G aspires to serve the world’s consumers better than our best competitors in every category and in every country in which we compete, and, as a result, deliver total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. Delivering and sustaining leadership levels of shareholder value creation requires balanced top-line growth, bottom-line growth and strong cash generation.Our strategic choices are focused on winning with consumers. The consumers who purchase and use our products are at the center of everything we do. We increase the number of users - and the usage - of our brands when we win at the zero, first and second moments of truth: when consumers research our categories and brands, purchase them in a store or online and use them in their homes.Winning with consumers around the world and against our best competitors requires innovation. Innovation has always been, and continues to be, P&G’s lifeblood. Innovation requires 14 The Procter & Gamble Companyconsumer insights and technology advancements that lead to product improvements, improved marketing and merchandising programs and game-changing inventions that create new brands and categories. Productivity improvement is critical to delivering our balanced top-line growth, bottom-line growth and value creation objectives. Productivity improvement and sales growth reinforce and fuel each other. We are driving productivity improvement across all elements of cost, including cost of goods sold, marketing and promotional expenses and non-manufacturing overhead. Productivity improvements and cost savings are being reinvested in product and packaging improvements, brand awareness-building advertising and trial-building sampling programs, increased sales coverage and R&D programs.We are improving operational effectiveness and organizational culture through enhanced clarity of roles and responsibilities, accountability and incentive compensation programs.The Company has undertaken an effort to focus and strengthen its business portfolio to compete in categories and with brands that are structurally attractive and that play to P&G's strengths. The ongoing portfolio of businesses consists of 10 product categories. These are categories where P&G has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies.We believe these strategies are right for the long-term health of the Company and our objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group.The Company expects the delivery of the following long-term annual financial targets will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive peer group:•Organic sales growth above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete;•Core EPS growth of mid-to-high single digits; and•Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater.In periods with significant macroeconomic pressures, we intend to maintain a disciplined approach to investing so as not to sacrifice the long-term health of our businesses to meet short-term objectives in any given year.SUMMARY OF 2017 RESULTSAmounts in millions, except per share amounts2017 Change vs. Prior Year 2016 Change vs. Prior Year 2015Net sales$65,058 — % $65,299 (8)% $70,749Operating income13,955 4 % 13,441 22 % 11,049Net earnings from continuing operations10,194 2 % 10,027 21 % 8,287Net earnings/(loss) from discontinued operations5,217 804 % 577 N/A (1,143)Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble15,326 46 % 10,508 49 % 7,036Diluted net earnings per common share5.59 51 % 3.69 51 % 2.44Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations3.69 6 % 3.49 23 % 2.84Core earnings per share3.92 7 % 3.67 (2)% 3.76Cash flow from operating activities12,753 (17)% 15,435 6 % 14,608•Net sales were unchanged at $65.1 billion including a negative 2% impact from foreign exchange.◦Organic sales increased 2% on a 2% increase in organic volume.◦Unit volume increased 1%.

All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are ""forward-looking statements"" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors in this Form 10-K.Global Economic Conditions. Current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-dependent economies, greater political unrest in the Middle East and Central & Eastern Europe, further economic instability in the European Union, political instability in certain Latin American markets, further economic slowdowns in Japan and China and changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our earnings.Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. If we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings. Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. As discussed later in this MD&A, we initiated certain non-manufacturing overhead reduction projects along with manufacturing and other supply chain cost improvements projects in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2017, we announced an additional multi-year cost reduction program. These programs are resulting in significant enrollment and other savings. If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings.Foreign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Over the past four years, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria, and the United Kingdom have had, and could continue to have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings. Increased pricing in response to these fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales.Government Policies. Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies. For example, the U.S. is considering corporate tax reform that may significantly impact the corporate tax rate and change the U.S. tax treatment of international earnings. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt and currency exposure in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria and Ukraine. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, operating margin and net earnings. For example, during fiscal 2015, the Company deconsolidated its Venezuelan subsidiaries due to evolving conditions that resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar and restricted our ability to pay dividends and satisfy certain other obligations denominated in U.S. dollars.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative costs (SG&A), other non-operating items and income taxes. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of initiatives and other activities by competitors), geographic expansion and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as pricing actions (which can also indirectly impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the U.S.Most of our cost of products sold and SG&A are to some extent variable in nature. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for example, product or package improvements) and to a lesser extent scale impacts (for costs 16 The Procter & Gamble Companythat are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary drivers of SG&A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. Overhead costs are also variable in nature, but on a relative basis, less so than marketing costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth. Accordingly, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs.The Company is in the midst of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. The plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy.Net SalesFiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Net sales were unchanged at $65.1 billion in 2017 on a 1% increase in unit volume versus the prior year period. Volume increased low single digits in Grooming, Health Care, Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Volume decreased low single digits in Beauty. Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and was unchanged in developing regions. Organic volume increased low single digits in both developed and developing markets. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%. Neither pricing nor mix had any net impact on net sales for the year. Organic sales grew 2% driven by a 2% increase in organic volume.Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 Net sales decreased 8% to $65.3 billion in 2016 on a 3% decrease in unit volume versus the prior year period. Volume decreased low single digits in Grooming, Health Care, Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care and decreased mid-single digits in Beauty. Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and declined high single digits in developing regions, in part due to increased pricing to address foreign exchange devaluations and due to the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures. Organic volume declined mid-single digits in developing markets. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 6%, while higher pricing drove a 1% favorable impact on net sales. Organic volume decreased 1% and organic sales grew 1% driven by higher pricing.Operating CostsComparisons as a percentage of net sales; Years ended June 302017 Basis Point Change 2016 Basis Point Change 2015Gross margin50.0% 40 49.6% 200 47.6%Selling, general and administrative expense28.5% (50) 29.0% (10) 29.1%Operating margin21.5% 90 20.6% 500 15.6%Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes20.4% (10) 20.5% 490 15.6%Net earnings from continuing operations15.7% 30 15.4% 370 11.7%Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble23.6% 750 16.1% 620 9.9%Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016Gross margin increased 40 basis points (bps) to 50.0% of net sales in 2017. Gross margin increased primarily due to:•a 230 basis-point positive impact from total manufacturing cost savings (210 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments),•a 20 basis-point benefit from lower restructuring charges and•a 10 basis-point benefit from positive scale impacts due to higher volume.These impacts were partially offset by:•a 90 basis-point decrease from unfavorable product mix between segments (caused primarily by the lower relative proportion of sales in Grooming, which has higher than company-average gross margins) and within segments (due to disproportionate growth of lower margin products, forms and package sizes in certain businesses),•a 40 basis-point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange and •a combined 70 basis-point impact due to higher commodities and other costs.Total SG&A decreased 2% to $18.6 billion as increased overhead and advertising spending were more than offset by a reduction in other operating expenses, primarily due to a reduction in net foreign exchange transactional costs and gains on real estate sales. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 50 basis points to 28.5% as a result of the decline in other operating expenses.•Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points due to an increase in marketing activities, partially offset by productivity savings.•Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points, primarily driven by wage inflation and increased sales personnel in certain businesses, partially offset by 20 basis points of productivity savings.•Other operating expenses as a percent of net sales declined 80 basis points. Lower foreign exchange transactional charges reduced SG&A as a percentage of net sales by The Procter & Gamble Company 17approximately 20 basis points. The balance of the reduction is primarily driven by gains on sales of real estate.Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 Gross margin increased 200 basis points to 49.6% of net sales in 2016. Gross margin increased primarily due to:•a 210 basis-point positive impact from manufacturing cost savings,•a 110 basis-point benefit from lower commodity costs and•a 70 basis-point benefit of higher pricing.These impacts were partially offset by:•a 70 basis-point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange,•a 70 basis-point decrease due to unfavorable product mix caused by the disproportionate decline of higher margin segments like Beauty and by product form mix within the segments,•a 20 basis-point decrease from negative scale impacts due to lower volume and•a 20 basis-point decline due to incremental restructuring activity.Total SG&A decreased 8% to $18.9 billion in 2016 primarily due to reduced overhead spending and a decrease in foreign exchange transaction charges. SG&A as a percentage of net sales declined 10 basis points to 29.0%, as negative scale impacts of lower net sales and inflationary impacts were more than offset by cost savings efforts, mainly in overhead spending, and lower foreign exchange transactional charges. •Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 90 basis points due to the negative scale impacts from reduced sales.•Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points, as 90 basis points of productivity savings were partially offset by wage inflation, increased sales personnel in certain businesses and investments in research and development. •Lower foreign exchange transactional charges reduced SG&A as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70 basis points. A pre-deconsolidation balance sheet remeasurement charge in Venezuela in fiscal year 2015 drove 20 basis points of this decline. The balance of the reduction relates to lower transactional charges from revaluing receivables and payables from transactions denominated in a currency other than a local entity’s functional currency.In addition to the gross margin expansion and decrease in SG&A as a percent of net sales discussed above, operating margin also increased by 290 basis points in 2016 due to a $2.0 billion charge in 2015 related to the deconsolidation of the Company's Venezuelan subsidiaries.Non-Operating ItemsFiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016•Interest expense was $465 million in 2017, a decrease of $114 million versus the prior year due to a decrease in weighted average interest rates. •Interest income was $171 million in 2017, comparable to 2016.•Other non-operating income/(expense), which consists primarily of divestiture gains, investment income, and other non-operating items, was a net expense of $404 million in 2017 versus a net income of $325 million in 2016, a $729 million year-over-year decrease. This change is due to a $543 million current-year charge related to early extinguishment of long-term debt and a reduction in gains on minor brand divestitures. In 2017, we had approximately $110 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Hipoglos (a baby care brand sold primarily in Brazil) and other minor brands. The prior year divestiture activities included approximately $300 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Escudo and certain hair care brands in Europe and IMEA.Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015•Interest expense was $579 million in 2016, a decrease of $47 million versus the prior year due to lower average debt balances.•Interest income was $182 million in 2016, an increase of $33 million versus the prior year primarily due to increasing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities balances.•Other non-operating income, which primarily includes divestiture gains and investment income, decreased $115 million to $325 million in 2016, due primarily to lower gains on minor brand divestitures. In 2016, we had approximately $300 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Escudo and certain hair care brands in Europe and IMEA. The prior year acquisition and divestiture activities included approximately $450 million in divestiture gains, including Zest, Camay, Fekkai and Wash & Go hair care brands and Vaposteam.Income TaxesFiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 190 basis points to 23.1%. The rate declined due to:•a 130 basis-points impact from excess tax benefits associated with share-based payments due to the adoption of FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting in 2017,•a 150 basis-point benefit from discrete impacts related to uncertain income tax positions (which netted to approximately 205 basis points in the current year versus 55 basis points in the prior year),•a 50 basis-point benefit from the tax impact of the early extinguishment of long-term debt, and•a 130 basis-point benefit from the prior year establishment of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards.These benefits were partially offset by a 230 basis-point increase from unfavorable geographic mix, primarily due to a greater proportion of total income taxed in the U.S. and a 40 basis-point increase due to the impact of minor brand divestitures.18 The Procter & Gamble CompanyFiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 30 basis points to 25.0% in 2016 mainly due to:•a 260 basis-point negative impact from the unfavorable geographic mix of earnings, and•a 130 basis-point impact in 2016 from the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and the impact of favorable discrete adjustments related to uncertain income tax positions (which netted to 55 basis points in 2016 versus 85 basis points in 2015).These benefits were partially offset by a 400 basis point decrease related to the non-deductibility of the Venezuelan deconsolidation charge in 2015.Net EarningsFiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Net earnings from continuing operations increased $167 million, or 2%, to $10.2 billion. Operating income improved $514 million, or 4%, due to improved gross margin and reduced SG&A costs. Net earnings also benefitted from a lower tax rate in 2017. These benefits were partially offset by the increase in net non-operating expenses, discussed above. Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $420 million in 2017 due to weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar, including those in Argentina, Nigeria, Egypt and the United Kingdom. This impact includes both transactional charges as discussed above in Operating Costs and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.Net earnings from discontinued operations increased $4.6 billion in 2017 to $5.2 billion. This change was driven by the $5.3 billion gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands in the current year, partially offset by the impact of the base period results, which included the net earnings of the Batteries and Beauty Brands businesses prior to divestiture, a gain on the sale of the Batteries business and impairment charges on the Batteries business prior to divestiture (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $4.8 billion, or 46%, to $15.3 billion.Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.20, or 6%, to $3.69 due to the increase in net earnings from continuing operations and a reduction in the number of weighted average shares outstanding following the shares tendered in the sale of the Beauty Brands to Coty (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), along with ongoing share repurchases.Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations were $1.90. This was an increase of $1.70 per share versus the prior year primarily resulting from the gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands. Diluted net earnings per share increased $1.90, or 51%, to $5.59.Core EPS increased 7% to $3.92. Core EPS in fiscal year 2017 represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the charge related to early extinguishment of long-term debt and incremental restructuring charges related to our productivity and cost savings plan. The increase was driven by operating margin expansion, lower effective tax rate and the reduction in the number of weighted average shares outstanding discussed above.Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 Net earnings from continuing operations increased $1.7 billion, or 21%, to $10.0 billion in 2016 primarily due to the base period charge of $2.1 billion after-tax related to the deconsolidation of Venezuelan subsidiaries. Earnings also declined due to the impact of the decline in net sales in fiscal 2016, partially offset by improved gross margin and the reduction in SG&A. Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by about $880 million in 2016 due to weakening of certain key currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and Russia. This impact includes both transactional charges as discussed above in Operating Costs and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.Net earnings from discontinued operations improved $1.7 billion in 2016 to $577 million. Batteries drove a $2.1 billion improvement due primarily to a $1.8 billion reduction in after-tax impairment charges in the Batteries business ($350 million in 2016 compared to $2.1 billion in 2015) and a $422 million after-tax gain in 2016 from the sale of the Batteries business. This was partially offset by a decrease in the earnings of the Beauty Brands in 2016 (see Notes 4 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $3.5 billion, or 49% to $10.5 billion.Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.65, or 23%, to $3.49 in 2016 due to the increase in net earnings and a decline in the average number of shares outstanding. Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.20 primarily resulting from the gain on the sale of the Batteries business. This was an improvement of $0.60 per share versus the prior year. Diluted net earnings per share increased $1.25, or 51%, to $3.69.Core EPS decreased 2% to $3.67 in 2016. Core EPS in fiscal year 2016 represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges for certain European legal matters and incremental restructuring related to our productivity and cost savings plan. The decline was driven by reduced net sales and foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by gross margin expansion.Venezuela ImpactsThere are a number of currency and other operating controls and restrictions in Venezuela, which have evolved over time and may continue to evolve in the future. These evolving conditions resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar and restricted our Venezuelan operations’ ability to pay dividends or pay for certain raw and package materials, finished goods and services denominated in U.S. dollars. For accounting purposes, this resulted in a lack of control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Therefore, in accordance with the applicable accounting standards for consolidation, effective The Procter & Gamble Company 19June 30, 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting. This resulted in a write-off of all of the net assets of our Venezuelan subsidiaries, along with Venezuela related assets held by other subsidiaries. Beginning in fiscal 2016, our financial results only include sales of finished goods to our Venezuelan subsidiaries to the extent we receive payments from Venezuela. Accordingly, we no longer include the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries’ operations in our financial results.SEGMENT RESULTSSegment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. The results of these reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs such as interest expense, investing activities and certain restructuring and asset impairment costs. These costs are reported in our Corporate segment and are included as part of our Corporate segment discussion. Additionally, as described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we apply blended statutory tax rates in the segments. Eliminations to adjust segment results to arrive at our consolidated effective tax rate are included in Corporate. All references to net earnings throughout the discussion of segment results refer to net earnings from continuing operations.Net Sales Change Drivers 2017 vs. 2016 (1) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume Excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Foreign Exchange Price Mix Other (2) Net Sales GrowthBeauty(2)% 1% (2)% 1 % 2 % 1% — %Grooming2 % 3% (2)% (1)% (2)% —% (3)%Health Care3 % 4% (2)% — % 1 % —% 2 %Fabric & Home Care1 % 2% (2)% — % 1 % —% — %Baby, Feminine & Family Care2 % 2% (2)% (1)% — % —% (1)%TOTAL COMPANY1 % 2% (2)% — % — % 1% — % Net Sales Change Drivers 2016 vs. 2015 (1) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume Excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Foreign Exchange Price Mix Other (2) Net Sales GrowthBeauty(5)% (2)% (6)% 2% — % —% (9)%Grooming(2)% (2)% (9)% 5% (2)% —% (8)%Health Care(2)% (2)% (6)% 2% 1 % —% (5)%Fabric & Home Care(1)% 1 % (6)% —% — % —% (7)%Baby, Feminine & Family Care(3)% (2)% (6)% —% — % —% (9)%TOTAL COMPANY(3)% (1)% (6)% 1% — % —% (8)%(1) Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied.(2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales.BEAUTY($ millions)2017 Change vs. 2016 2016 Change vs. 2015VolumeN/A (2)% N/A (5)%Net sales$11,429 —% $11,477 (9)%Net earnings$1,914 (3)% $1,975 (9)%% of net sales16.7% (50) bps 17.2% (10) bpsFiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016Beauty net sales were unchanged at $11.4 billion in 2017 on a 2% decrease in unit volume.

Corporate net earnings from continuing operations improved by approximately $421 million in 2017, primarily due to:•lower restructuring charges in 2017 compared to the prior year,•a gain on the sale of real estate in the current fiscal year, •lower foreign exchange transactional charges,•a reduction in the proportion of corporate overhead spending not allocated to the segments, consisting in part of reduced stranded overheads following divestitures, and•current year tax benefits resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard on the tax impacts of share-based payments to employees (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).These benefits were partially offset by a $345 million after-tax charge on the early extinguishment of long-term debt in fiscal 2017 and lower gains from minor brand divestitures compared to 2016.Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015Corporate net sales decreased $44 million in 2016 to $422 million. Corporate net earnings from continuing operations improved by approximately $2.2 billion in 2016, primarily due to the $2.1 billion Venezuela deconsolidation charge in the prior fiscal year and lower foreign currency transactional charges. Additional discussion of these items impacting net earnings in Corporate are included in the Results of Operations section.Productivity and Cost Savings PlanIn 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing 24 The Procter & Gamble Companyand other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. In 2016 the Company communicated additional multi-year productivity and cost savings targets. In 2017, the Company communicated specific elements of the productivity and cost savings targets.As part of the original plan, the Company incurred approximately $5.6 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a six-year period (from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2017). Savings generated from the restructuring costs are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. Through 2017, these costs and other non-manufacturing enrollment reductions delivered approximately $2.9 billion in annual before-tax gross savings. The additional productivity and cost savings plan will further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. As part of this plan, the Company expects to incur approximately $1.2 billion in total before-tax restructuring costs in fiscal 2018 and 2019. This program is expected to result in meaningful non-manufacturing enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes.Restructuring accruals of $277 million as of June 30, 2017 are classified as current liabilities. During fiscal 2017, 48% of the restructuring charges incurred either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting.In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins.Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program and to the Operating Costs section of the MD&A for more information about the total benefit to operating margins from our total savings efforts.CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates.Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations. Operating Cash FlowFiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Operating cash flow was $12.8 billion in 2017, a 17% decrease from the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes, loss/(gain) on sale of assets and impairment charges) and the loss on early extinguishment of debt generated $13.0 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts used $281 million of operating cash flow.•An increase in accounts receivable used $322 million of cash due to higher relative sales late in the period as compared to the prior period, partially offset by collection of approximately $150 million of retained receivables from the Beauty Brands business. In addition, the number of days sales outstanding increased 1 day due in part to foreign exchange impacts. •Lower inventory generated $71 million of cash mainly due to supply chain optimizations, partially offset by increases to support business growth and increased commodity costs. Inventory days on hand decreased approximately 1 day primarily due to supply chain optimizations. •Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities decreased, using $149 million in operating cash flow. This was caused by reduced accruals from lower fourth quarter marketing and overhead activities as compared to the base period, as well as the payment of approximately $595 million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to the divestiture of the Beauty Brands business, including liabilities retained by the Company pursuant to the terms of the agreement. These impacts were partially offset by approximately $700 million related to extended payment terms with our suppliers. These factors, along with the impact of foreign exchange, drove a 4 day increase in days payable outstanding. Although difficult to project due to market and other dynamics, we anticipate incremental cash flow benefits from the extended payment terms with suppliers could decline slightly over the next fiscal year.•Other operating assets and liabilities used $43 million of cash.Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 Operating cash flow was $15.4 billion in 2016, a 6% increase from the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes, loss/(gain) on sale of assets and impairment charges) generated $13.6 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts generated $1.8 billion of operating cash flow.•Reduced accounts receivable generated $35 million of cash due to improved collection results partially offset by sales mix. The number of days sales outstanding increased 1 day due to foreign exchange impacts. •Lower inventory generated $116 million of cash mainly due to supply chain optimizations and lower commodity costs. Inventory days on hand increased 4 days primarily due to foreign exchange impacts. The Procter & Gamble Company 25•Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $1.3 billion in operating cash flow, of which approximately $0.8 billion was driven by extended payment terms with our suppliers. The balance was primarily driven by an increase in fourth quarter marketing activity versus the prior year. These items, along with the impact of foreign exchange, drove a 24 day increase in days payable outstanding. •Other operating assets and liabilities generated $204 million of cash.Adjusted Free Cash Flow. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding tax payments related to certain divestitures and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation. Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Adjusted free cash flow was $9.8 billion in 2017, a decrease of 19% versus the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in operating cash flows. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings, excluding the loss on debt extinguishment and impacts of the sale of the Beauty Brands, was 94% in 2017. Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 Adjusted free cash flow was $12.1 billion in 2016, an increase of 4% versus the prior year. The increase was driven by the increase in operating cash flows and decrease in capital spending. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the impairment charges and gain on the sale of the Batteries business, was 115% in 2016. Investing Cash FlowFiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Net investing activities consumed $5.7 billion in cash in 2017 mainly due to capital spending and purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by proceeds from asset sales, transactions related to the close of the Beauty Brands divestiture and sales and maturities of short-term investments. Fiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015 Net investing activities consumed $5.6 billion in cash in 2016 mainly due to capital spending, divestiture transactions and purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by sales and maturities of short-term investments. Capital Spending. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost efficiencies, were $3.4 billion in 2017 and $3.3 billion in 2016. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points to 5.2% in 2017. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales was 5.1% in 2016.Acquisitions. Acquisition activity was not material in 2017 or 2016. Proceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales in 2017 contributed $571 million in cash, primarily from real estate sales and other minor brand divestitures. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $432 million in cash in 2016 primarily from plant asset sales and other minor brand divestitures. In fiscal 2016, the Company invested $1.0 billion of cash, received from the pre-Beauty Brands divestiture issuance of transaction-related debt, in restricted cash. In fiscal 2017, the Company invested an additional $874 million of cash, received from the issuance of debt, in restricted cash. At the closing of the Beauty Brands transaction, $1.9 billion of restricted cash was released and returned to cash and cash equivalents and $475 million of cash was transferred to the discontinued Beauty Brands business. Financing Cash FlowDividend Payments. Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments. Dividends per common share increased 1.5% to $2.70 per share in 2017. Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $7.2 billion in 2017 and $7.4 billion in 2016. In April 2017, the Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.6695 to $0.6896 per share on Common Stock and Series A and B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock. This represents a 3% increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 61st consecutive year that our dividend has increased. We have paid a dividend for 127 years, every year since our incorporation in 1890.Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $31.6 billion as of June 30, 2017 and $30.6 billion as of June 30, 2016.Treasury Purchases. Total share repurchases were $5.2 billion in 2017 and $4.0 billion in 2016. In addition, the cash infusion of $1.7 billion in the Batteries divestiture was reflected as a purchase of treasury stock in 2016.LiquidityAt June 30, 2017, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $3.7 billion largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. As of June 30, 2017, $15.0 billion of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities is held off-shore by foreign subsidiaries. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation upon repatriation to the U.S. Under current law, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future. Of the June 30, 2017 balance of off-shore cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, the majority relates to various Western European countries. As of June 30, 2017, we did not have material cash, cash equivalents and 26 The Procter & Gamble Companymarketable securities balances in any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds.We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled, and should continue to enable, us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements.On June 30, 2017, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard & Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings were Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard & Poor's), all with a stable outlook.We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $8.0 billion facility split between a $3.2 billion five-year facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire in November 2021 and November 2017, respectively. Both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities. For additional details on debt see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.Contractual CommitmentsThe following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2017.Amounts in millionsTotal Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 YearsRECORDED LIABILITIES Total debt$31,455 $13,543 $3,101 $4,236 $10,575Capital leases51 13 20 10 8Uncertain tax positions (1)18 18 — — —OTHER Interest payments relating to long-term debt5,220 594 1,014 887 2,725Operating leases (2)1,493 261 510 354 368Minimum pension funding (3)378 123 255 — —Purchase obligations (4)1,607 843 393 169 202TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS$40,222 $15,395 $5,293 $5,656 $13,878(1) As of June 30, 2017, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $585 million, including $120 million of interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of June 30, 2017, cannot be made.(2) Operating lease obligations are shown net of guaranteed sublease income.(3) Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2020 are not currently determinable.(4) Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represents minimum commitments under take-or-pay agreements with suppliers and are in line with expected usage. This includes service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. Such amounts also include arrangements with suppliers that qualify as embedded operating leases. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting The Procter & Gamble Company 27policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.The Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, and our ability to uphold certain tax positions.Realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.A core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model, such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities. However, because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts, we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various cross-border transactions. We have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty. We estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70% of our global earnings. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. For additional details on the Company's income taxes, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Employee BenefitsWe sponsor various post-employment benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPEB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2017, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPEB assets was 6.9% and 8.3%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPEB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $100 million.Since pension and OPEB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans of 2.4% represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 1.0% change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $200 million. The average discount rate on the OPEB plan of 3.9% reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the U.S., which is where a majority of the plan participants receive benefits. A 1.0% change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax OPEB expense by approximately $70 million. For additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.28 The Procter & Gamble CompanyGoodwill and Intangible AssetsSignificant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations. We typically estimate the fair value of these assets using the income method, which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. The valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion, Company business plans and the discount rate applied to cash flows.Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. For example, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. In addition, changes to, or a failure to, achieve business plans or deterioration of macroeconomic conditions could result in reduced cash flows or higher discount rates, leading to a lower valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses.We test individual indefinite lived intangible assets by comparing the book value of each asset to the estimated fair value. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets. The test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two step process. In the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a second step to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. The second step of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting unit's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination. If the resulting implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment.Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, all customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. Impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized, but are tested separately at least annually for impairment. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high. Both of these wholly-acquired reporting units have fair value cushions that currently exceed the underlying carrying values. However, the Shave Care cushion, as well as the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset cushion, have been reduced to below 10% due in large part to an increased competitive market environment in the U.S., a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits and significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar that have occurred in recent years and resulted in reduced cash flow projections. As a result, this unit is more susceptible to impairment risk from adverse changes in business operating plans, category development and macroeconomic environment conditions, including any further significant devaluation of major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. While management has implemented strategies to address these events, adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of the business unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles (carrying values of Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset as of June 30, 2017 are $19 billion and $16 billion, respectively).See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing results.New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of June 30, 2017.The Procter & Gamble Company 29OTHER INFORMATIONHedging and Derivative Financial InstrumentsAs a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. Except within financing operations, we leverage the Company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments.Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the CorporateManager™ value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics™ dataset as of June 30, 2017. In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics™, a reasonable proxy is included.Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term.Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments.Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June 30, 2017, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements.Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use forward contracts with maturities of less than 18 months. In addition, we have entered into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions.Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2017, we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact on such instruments of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements.Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures.As of and during the years ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, we did not have any commodity hedging activity.Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAPOur discussion of financial results includes several ""non-GAAP"" financial measures. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business trends (i.e. trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. These measures include:Organic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of the Venezuela deconsolidation, acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis, and this measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.30 The Procter & Gamble CompanyThe following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth:Year ended June 30, 2017Net Sales GrowthForeign Exchange ImpactAcquisition/Divestiture Impact (1)Organic Sales GrowthBeauty— %2%1%3 %Grooming(3)%2%1%— %Health Care2 %2%1%5 %Fabric & Home Care— %2%1%3 %Baby, Feminine & Family Care(1)%2%—%1 %TOTAL COMPANY— %2%—%2 % Year ended June 30, 2016Net Sales GrowthForeign Exchange ImpactAcquisition/Divestiture Impact (1)Organic Sales GrowthBeauty(9)%6%3%— %Grooming(8)%9%1%2 %Health Care(5)%6%1%2 %Fabric & Home Care(7)%6%2%1 %Baby, Feminine & Family Care(9)%6%2%(1)%TOTAL COMPANY(8)%6%3%1 %(1) Acquisition/Divestiture Impact also includes the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and the rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales.Adjusted Free Cash Flow. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding certain divestiture impacts (tax payments related to certain divestitures). Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment.

Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding Batteries impairments, the gain on the sale of the Batteries and Beauty Brands businesses, the loss on early debt extinguishment and the Venezuela deconsolidation charges. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent.The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow productivity ($ millions): NetEarningsAdjustments to Net Earnings (1)Net Earnings Excluding AdjustmentsAdjusted Free Cash FlowAdjusted FreeCash FlowProductivity2017$15,411$(4,990)$10,421$9,78794%201610,604(72)10,53212,121115%20157,1444,18711,33111,601102%(1) Adjustments to Net Earnings relate to the loss on early debt extinguishment and gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands business in fiscal 2017, the gain on the sale of the Batteries business and the Batteries impairment in fiscal 2016, and the Batteries impairment and Venezuela deconsolidation charges in fiscal 2015.The Procter & Gamble Company 31Core EPS. Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated. Management views these non-GAAP measures as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. The table below provides a reconciliation of diluted net earnings per share to Core EPS, including the following reconciling items:•Incremental restructuring: The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. Beginning in 2012 Procter & Gamble began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that includes incremental restructuring activities. In 2017, the company announced elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings plan. These plans result in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs.•Early debt extinguishment charges: During fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a charge of $345 million after tax due to the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt. This charge represents the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished. •Charges for certain European legal matters: Several countries in Europe issued separate complaints alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in prior periods. The Company established Legal Reserves related to these charges. •Venezuela deconsolidation charge: For accounting purposes, evolving conditions resulted in a lack of control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Therefore, in accordance with the applicable accounting standards for consolidation, effective June 30, 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for our investment in those subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting. The charge was incurred to write off our net assets related to Venezuela.•Venezuela balance sheet remeasurement & devaluation impacts: Venezuela is a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. Prior to deconsolidation, the government enacted episodic changes to currency exchange mechanisms and rates, which resulted in currency remeasurement charges for non-dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities held by our Venezuelan subsidiaries.We do not view the above items to be indicative of underlying business results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES(Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Reconciliation of Non-GAAP MeasuresTwelve Months Ended June 30, 2017 AS REPORTED (GAAP) DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS INCREMENTAL RESTRUCTURING EARLY DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT ROUNDING NON-GAAP (CORE)COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD$32,535 $— $(498) $— $— $32,037SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE18,568 — 99 — — 18,667OPERATING INCOME 13,955 — 399 — — 14,354INCOME TAX ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS3,063 — 120 198 — 3,381NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO P&G15,326 (5,217) 279 345 (1) 10,732 — — — — Core EPSDILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE* $5.59 $(1.90) $0.10 $0.13 $— $3.92* Diluted net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble.

We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise.The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections:•Overview•Summary of 2018 Results •Economic Conditions and Uncertainties•Results of Operations•Segment Results•Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity•Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates•Other InformationThroughout the MD&A we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, foreign exchange and India Goods and Services tax changes from year-over-year comparisons. Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending and certain divestiture impacts. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding certain one-time items. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures.Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal-year-to-date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months.OVERVIEWP&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products, as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.The Procter & Gamble Company 13ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTUREOur organizational structure is comprised of Global Business Units (GBUs), Selling and Market Operations (SMOs), Global Business Services (GBS) and Corporate Functions (CF).Global Business UnitsOur GBUs are organized into ten product categories. Under U.S. GAAP, the GBUs underlying the ten product categories are aggregated into five reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric & Home Care; and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. The GBUs are responsible for developing overall brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovations and marketing plans. The following provides additional detail on our reportable segments and the ten product categories and brand composition within each segment.Reportable Segments% ofNet Sales (1)% of NetEarnings (1)Product Categories (Sub-Categories)Major BrandsBeauty19%23%Hair Care (Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments)Head & Shoulders, Pantene, RejoiceSkin and Personal Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care)Olay, Old Spice, Safeguard, SK-IIGrooming10%14%Grooming (2) (Shave Care - Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care; Appliances)Braun, Fusion, Gillette, Mach3, Prestobarba, VenusHealth Care12%13%Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care)Crest, Oral-BPersonal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care)Metamucil, Prilosec, VicksFabric & Home Care32%27%Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents)Ariel, Downy, Gain, TideHome Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care)Cascade, Dawn, Febreze, Mr. Clean, SwifferBaby, Feminine & Family Care27%23%Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants)Luvs, PampersFeminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care)Always, TampaxFamily Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper)Bounty, Charmin, Puffs(1) Percent of Net sales and Net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2018 (excluding results held in Corporate).(2) The Grooming product category is comprised of the Shave Care and Appliances GBUs. Recent Developments: During fiscal 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire the over the counter (OTC) healthcare business of Merck KGaA for €3.375 billion ($3.9 billion based on current exchange rates). This business primarily sells OTC consumer healthcare products, mainly in Europe, Latin America and Asia markets. Total sales for the business during its most recent fiscal year were approximately $1 billion. We anticipate the transaction to close during fiscal 2019, with the timing subject to regulatory clearance and customary closing conditions. The Company also reached an agreement during fiscal 2018 to dissolve our PGT Healthcare partnership, a venture between the Company and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd (Teva) in the OTC consumer healthcare business. Pursuant to the agreement, PGT product assets will return to the original respective parent companies to reestablish independent OTC businesses. This transaction was completed in July 2018 and will be accounted for as a sale of the Teva portion of the PGT business. The Company expects to record an after-tax gain on the sale of approximately $285 million. During fiscal 2017, the Company completed the divestiture of four product categories, which included 43 of the Company's beauty brands (""Beauty Brands""), including the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and the fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. The Beauty Brands had historically been part of the Company’s Beauty reportable segment. The results of the Beauty Brands are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. During fiscal 2016, the Company completed the divestiture of its Batteries business. The Batteries business had historically been part of the Company’s Fabric & Home Care reportable segment. The results of the Batteries business are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. As a result of these divestitures, the Company's portfolio is comprised of 10 category-based businesses where P&G has 14 The Procter & Gamble Companyleading market positions, strong brands and consumer meaningful product technologies.Refer to Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on each of these divestiture transactions.Beauty: We are a global market leader in the beauty category. Most of the beauty markets in which we compete are highly fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. We compete in skin and personal care and in hair care. In skin and personal care, we offer a wide variety of products, ranging from deodorants to personal cleansing to skin care, such as our Olay brand, which is one of the top facial skin care brands in the world with nearly 6% global market share. We are the global market leader in the retail hair care market with over 20% global market share primarily behind our Pantene and Head & Shoulders brands. Grooming: We compete in shave care and appliances. In Shave Care, we are the global market leader in the blades and razors market. Our global blades and razors market share is nearly 65%, primarily behind the Gillette franchise, including our Fusion, Mach3, Prestobarba and Venus brands. Our appliances, such as electric shavers and epilators, are sold under the Braun brand in a number of markets around the world where we compete against both global and regional competitors. We hold nearly 25% of the male shavers market and over 50% of the female epilators market.Health Care: We compete in oral care and personal health care. In oral care, there are several global competitors in the market and we have the number two market share position with nearly 20% global market share behind our Oral-B and Crest brands. In personal health care, we are a top ten competitor in a large, highly fragmented industry, primarily behind respiratory treatments (Vicks brand), non-prescription heartburn medications (Prilosec OTC brand) and digestive wellness products (Metamucil, Pepto Bismol and Align brands). Nearly all of our sales outside the U.S. in personal health care are generated through the PGT Healthcare partnership with Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd. In April 2018, we reached an agreement to dissolve the PGT Healthcare partnership and to acquire the OTC healthcare business of Merck KGaA as discussed above. Fabric & Home Care: This segment is comprised of a variety of fabric care products, including laundry detergents, additives and fabric enhancers; and home care products, including dishwashing liquids and detergents, surface cleaners and air fresheners. In fabric care, we generally have the number one or number two market share position in the markets in which we compete and are the global market leader with over 25% global market share, primarily behind our Tide, Ariel and Downy brands. Our global home care market share is over 20% across the categories in which we compete.Baby, Feminine & Family Care: In baby care, we are the global market leader and compete mainly in diapers, pants and baby wipes with over 25% global market share. We have the number one or number two market share position in most of the key markets in which we compete, primarily behind Pampers, the Company's largest brand, with annual net sales of more than $8 billion. We are the global market leader in the feminine care category with over 25% global market share, primarily behind Always. We also compete in the adult incontinence category in certain markets, achieving over 10% market share in most of the markets where we compete. Our family care business is predominantly a North American business comprised largely of the Bounty paper towel and Charmin toilet paper brands. U.S. market shares are over 40% for Bounty and over 25% for Charmin.Selling and Market OperationsOur SMOs are responsible for developing and executing go-to-market plans at the local level. The SMOs include dedicated retail customer, trade channel and country-specific teams. Our SMOs are organized under six regions, comprised of North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Greater China and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA). Throughout the MD&A, we reference business results in developed markets, which are comprised of North America, Western Europe and Japan, and developing markets, which are all other markets not included in developed. Corporate FunctionsCF provides company-level strategy and portfolio analysis, corporate accounting, treasury, tax, external relations, governance, human resources and legal, as well as other centralized functional support.Global Business ServicesGBS provides technology, processes and standard data tools to enable the GBUs, the SMOs and Corporate Functions to better understand the business and better serve consumers and customers. The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class solutions at a low cost and with minimal capital investment.STRATEGIC FOCUSP&G aspires to serve the world’s consumers better than our best competitors in every category and in every country in which we compete, and, as a result, deliver total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. Delivering and sustaining leadership levels of shareholder value creation requires balanced top-line growth, bottom-line growth and strong cash generation.Our strategic choices are focused on winning with consumers. The consumers who purchase and use our products are at the center of everything we do. We win with consumers by delivering superiority across the five key elements of product, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value equation.Winning with consumers around the world and against our best competitors requires innovation. Innovation has always been, and continues to be, P&G’s lifeblood. Innovation requires consumer insights and technology advancements that lead to product improvements, improved marketing and merchandising programs and game-changing inventions that create new brands and categories. Productivity improvement is critical to delivering our balanced top-line growth, bottom-line growth and value creation objectives. Productivity improvement and sales growth reinforce and fuel each other. We are driving productivity The Procter & Gamble Company 15improvement across all elements of cost, including cost of goods sold, marketing and promotional expenses and non-manufacturing overhead. Productivity improvements and cost savings are being reinvested in product and packaging improvements, brand awareness-building advertising and trial-building sampling programs, increased sales coverage and R&D programs.We are improving operational effectiveness and organizational culture through enhanced clarity of roles and responsibilities, accountability and incentive compensation programs.The Company has undertaken an effort to focus and strengthen its business portfolio to compete in categories and with brands that are structurally attractive and that play to P&G's strengths. The ongoing portfolio of businesses consists of 10 product categories. These are categories where P&G has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies. We believe these strategies are right for the long-term health of the Company and our objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group.The Company expects the delivery of the following long-term annual financial targets will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive peer group:•Organic sales growth above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete;•Core EPS growth of mid-to-high single digits; and•Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater.In periods with significant macroeconomic pressures, we intend to maintain a disciplined approach to investing so as not to sacrifice the long-term health of our businesses to meet short-term objectives in any given year.SUMMARY OF 2018 RESULTSAmounts in millions, except per share amounts2018 Change vs. Prior Year 2017 Change vs. Prior Year 2016Net sales$66,832 3 % $65,058 — % $65,299Operating income13,711 (2)% 13,955 4 % 13,441Net earnings from continuing operations9,861 (3)% 10,194 2 % 10,027Net earnings from discontinued operations— N/A 5,217 N/A 577Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble9,750 (36)% 15,326 46 % 10,508Diluted net earnings per common share3.67 (34)% 5.59 51 % 3.69Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations3.67 (1)% 3.69 6 % 3.49Core earnings per share4.22 8 % 3.92 7 % 3.67Cash flow from operating activities14,867 17 % 12,753 (17)% 15,435•Net sales increased 3% to $66.8 billion including a positive 2% impact from foreign exchange.◦Organic sales increased 1% on a 2% increase in organic volume.◦Unit volume increased 1%.

Excluding the impact of minor brand divestitures, organic volume increased mid-single digits in Fabric & Home Care.•Net earnings from continuing operations decreased $333 million or 3% in fiscal 2018, due primarily to the transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Act). Please refer to Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on tax impacts. Operating income decreased 2% due to reduced margins, partially offset by net sales growth. This was largely offset by an increase in Other non-operating income/(expense), net, due to higher costs of early extinguishment of debt in the base period. Favorable foreign exchange impacts increased net earnings from continuing operations by approximately $125 million or 1%.•Net earnings from discontinued operations were zero in fiscal 2018 compared to $5.2 billion in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the net impact of a gain on the sale of our Beauty Brands business. •Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $9.8 billion, a decrease of $5.6 billion or 36% versus the prior year primarily due to the aforementioned reduction in net earnings from discontinued operations.•Diluted net earnings per share decreased 34% to $3.67.◦Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 1% to $3.67.◦Core EPS increased 8% to $4.22.•Cash flow from operating activities was $14.9 billion.◦Adjusted free cash flow was $11.2 billion.◦Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 104%.16 The Procter & Gamble CompanyECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIESWe discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are ""forward-looking statements"" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risks that could impact our results, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors in this Form 10-K.Global Economic Conditions. Current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-dependent economies, greater political unrest in the Middle East, Central & Eastern Europe and the Korean peninsula, economic uncertainty related to the execution of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, political instability in certain Latin American markets and overall economic slowdowns, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our earnings.Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. If we are unable to manage commodity and other cost fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings. Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. As discussed later in this MD&A, we initiated certain non-manufacturing overhead reduction projects along with manufacturing and other supply chain cost improvement projects in 2012. In fiscal 2017, we communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year cost reduction program which is resulting in enrollment reductions and other savings. If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings.Foreign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Over previous fiscal years, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Egypt, Russia, Turkey and the United Kingdom have previously had, and could in the future have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales and profits. Government Policies. Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies, for example, the U.S. Tax Act enacted in December 2017, the implications and uncertainties of which are disclosed elsewhere in this report. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Algeria and Egypt. Further, our earnings and sales could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere, including potential increases of import tariffs. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, operating margin and net earnings.For information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe key metrics included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative costs (SG&A), other non-operating items and income taxes. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of initiatives and other activities by competitors), marketing spending and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as pricing actions (which can also indirectly impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the U.S.Most of our cost of products sold and SG&A are to some extent variable in nature. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the The Procter & Gamble Company 17underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for example, product or package improvements) and to a lesser extent scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary components of SG&A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. Overhead costs are also variable in nature, but on a relative basis, less so than marketing costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth. Accordingly, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs.The Company is in the midst of a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. The plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy.Net SalesFiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 Net sales increased 3% to $66.8 billion in 2018 on a 1% increase in unit volume versus the prior year. Volume increased low single digits in Beauty, Health Care and Fabric & Home Care and was unchanged in Grooming. Volume decreased low single digits in Baby, Feminine and Family Care. Excluding the impact of minor brand divestitures, Fabric & Home Care organic volume increased mid-single digits. Volume increased low single digits in developed and developing regions. Favorable foreign exchange increased net sales by 2%. Pricing had a negative 1% impact on net sales. Product mix had a positive 1% impact on net sales primarily due to a disproportionate growth in super-premium brands. Organic sales grew 1% driven by a 2% increase in organic volume.Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Net sales were unchanged at $65.1 billion in 2017 on a 1% increase in unit volume versus the prior year period. Volume increased low single digits in Grooming, Health Care, Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Volume decreased low single digits in Beauty. Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and was unchanged in developing regions. Organic volume increased low single digits in both developed and developing markets. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%. Neither pricing nor mix had any net impact on net sales for the year. Organic sales grew 2% driven by a 2% increase in organic volume.Operating CostsComparisons as a percentage of net sales; Years ended June 302018 Basis Point Change 2017 Basis Point Change 2016Gross margin48.7% (130) 50.0% 40 49.6%Selling, general and administrative expense28.2% (30) 28.5% (50) 29.0%Operating margin20.5% (100) 21.5% 90 20.6%Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes19.9% (50) 20.4% (10) 20.5%Net earnings from continuing operations14.8% (90) 15.7% 30 15.4%Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble14.6% (900) 23.6% 750 16.1%Fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017Gross margin decreased 130 basis points to 48.7% of net sales in 2018. Gross margin benefited 200 basis points from total manufacturing cost savings (170 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments). This was more than offset by:•a 90 basis-point negative impact due to higher commodity costs,•a 50 basis-point decline due to reduced pricing,•a 100 basis-point decline from unfavorable product mix (within segments due to the disproportionate growth of lower margin product forms, large sizes and club channels and between segments caused by the disproportionate volume growth in Fabric & Home Care, which has lower than company-average gross margins),•a 30 basis-point negative impact from higher restructuring charges and•a 30 basis-point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange. Total SG&A increased 2% to $18.9 billion driven by increased overhead and marketing spending, as well as an increase in other net operating expenses, primarily due to higher gains on real estate sales in the base period. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points to 28.2%. Reductions in marketing and overhead spending as a percentage of net sales were partially offset by an increase in other net operating expenses.•Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points, primarily driven by reductions in agency compensation and production costs.•Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points, primarily driven by productivity savings and sales growth leverage, partially offset by higher restructuring costs versus the base year.•Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points primarily due to gains on the sale of real estate in the base year.18 The Procter & Gamble CompanyFiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Gross margin increased 40 basis points (bps) to 50.0% of net sales in 2017. Gross margin increased primarily due to:•a 230 basis-point positive impact from total manufacturing cost savings (210 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments),•a 20 basis-point benefit from lower restructuring charges and•a 10 basis-point benefit from positive scale impacts due to higher volume.These impacts were partially offset by:•a 90 basis-point decrease from unfavorable product mix between segments (caused primarily by the lower relative proportion of sales in Grooming, which has higher than company-average gross margins) and within segments (due to disproportionate growth of lower margin products, forms and package sizes in certain businesses),•a 40 basis-point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange and•a combined 70 basis-point impact due to higher commodities and other costs.Total SG&A decreased 2% to $18.6 billion as increased overhead and advertising spending were more than offset by a reduction in other operating expenses, primarily due to a reduction in net foreign exchange transactional costs and gains on real estate sales. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 50 basis points to 28.5% as a result of the decline in other operating expenses.•Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points due to an increase in marketing activities, partially offset by productivity savings.•Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points, primarily driven by wage inflation and increased sales personnel in certain businesses, partially offset by 20 basis points of productivity savings.•Other operating expenses as a percent of net sales declined 80 basis points. Lower foreign exchange transactional charges reduced SG&A as a percentage of net sales by approximately 20 basis points. The balance of the reduction is primarily driven by gains on sales of real estate.Non-Operating ItemsFiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017•Interest expense was $506 million in 2018, an increase of $41 million versus the prior year due to an increase in average long term debt balances and an increase in U.S. interest rates.•Interest income was $247 million in 2018, an increase of $76 million versus the prior year primarily due to an increase in average balances of interest bearing cash and cash equivalents and investment securities balances and an increase in U.S. interest rates.•Other non-operating income/(expense), which consists primarily of divestiture gains, investment income and other non-operating items was a net expense of $126 million in 2018, an improvement of $278 million versus the prior year primarily due to lower charges for the early extinguishment of debt (which totaled $346 million in the current year and $543 million in the base year) and an increase in minor brand divestiture gains. In the current year we had approximately $190 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Swisse, Bold and other minor brands. In 2017, we had approximately $110 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Hipoglos and other minor brands. Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016•Interest expense was $465 million in 2017, a decrease of $114 million versus the prior year due to a decrease in weighted average interest rates.•Interest income was $171 million in 2017, comparable to 2016.•Other non-operating income/(expense), which consists primarily of divestiture gains, investment income and other non-operating items, was a net expense of $404 million in 2017 versus a net income of $325 million in 2016, a $729 million year-over-year decrease. This change is due to a $543 million current-year charge related to early extinguishment of long-term debt and a reduction in gains on minor brand divestitures. In 2017, we had approximately $110 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Hipoglos (a baby care brand sold primarily in Brazil) and other minor brands. The prior year divestiture activities included approximately $300 million in minor brand divestiture gains, including Escudo and certain hair care brands in Europe and IMEA.Income TaxesFiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased 290 basis points to 26.0% in 2018. A net transitional charge of $602 million resulting from the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act caused a 450 basis-point increase in the current period rate (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion). The remaining net decrease of 160 basis points in the effective rate was driven by:•a 280 basis-point year over year reduction from the ongoing impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, as the impact of the lower blended U.S. federal rate on current year earnings versus prior year rate was partially offset by reduced foreign tax credits versus prior year due to the inability to fully credit foreign taxes under the U.S. Tax Act,•a 170 basis-point reduction from favorable geographic mix of earnings, primarily due to a greater proportion of income in lower tax foreign jurisdictions, •a 180 basis-point increase from reduced favorable discrete impacts related to uncertain income tax positions (which netted to approximately 25 basis points in the current year versus 205 basis points in the prior year),•a 70 basis-point increase from reduced excess tax benefits from share-based compensation (60 basis points in the current year versus 130 basis points in the prior year) and•a 40 basis-point unfavorable impact due to reduced benefits from the tax impacts of early extinguishment of long-term debt (10 basis-point benefit in current year versus 50 basis-point benefit in the prior year).The Procter & Gamble Company 19Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased 190 basis points to 23.1%. The rate declined due to:•a 130 basis-point impact from excess tax benefits associated with share-based payments due to the adoption of FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting in 2017,•a 150 basis-point benefit from discrete impacts related to uncertain income tax positions (which netted to approximately 205 basis points in the current year versus 55 basis points in the prior year),•a 50 basis-point benefit from the tax impact of the early extinguishment of long-term debt and•a 130 basis-point benefit from the prior year establishment of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards.These benefits were partially offset by a 230 basis-point increase from unfavorable geographic mix, primarily due to a greater proportion of total income taxed in the U.S. and a 40 basis-point increase due to the impact of minor brand divestitures.Net EarningsFiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 Net earnings from continuing operations decreased 3% to $9.9 billion. Operating income decreased $244 million, or 2%, as the increase in net sales and decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales were more than offset by the reduction in gross margin. The increase in net non-operating income/(expense) discussed above benefited net earnings. Net earnings from continuing operations before taxes increased 1%. Increased income tax expense negatively impacted net earnings from continuing operations by approximately 4% due largely to the net charge for the transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act in 2018. Foreign exchange had a positive impact of $125 million on net earnings in 2018 due to strengthening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar, including those in the United Kingdom, China, Canada and Russia. This impact includes both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.Net earnings from discontinued operations were zero in 2018. Net earnings from discontinued operations were $5.2 billion in 2017, primarily due to the gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands which closed on October 1, 2016 (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased $5.6 billion, or 36%, to $9.8 billion. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in net earnings from discontinued operations.Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations declined $0.02, or 1%, to $3.67 due primarily to the reduction in net earnings from continuing operations, partially offset by a reduction in the number of weighted average shares outstanding.Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations were zero in 2018, and were $1.90 per share in the prior year due to the gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands in 2017. Diluted net earnings per share decreased $1.92, or 34%, to $3.67. Core EPS increased 8% to $4.22. Core EPS represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the current year net charge for the transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act and the charges in both periods for early extinguishment of debt and incremental restructuring charges related to our productivity and cost savings plans. The increase was driven by increased sales, the lower effective tax rate on core earnings (excluding the transitional net tax charge from the U.S. Tax Act) and the reduction in the number of weighted average shares outstanding discussed above.Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Net earnings from continuing operations increased $167 million, or 2%, to $10.2 billion. Operating income improved $514 million, or 4%, due to improved gross margin and reduced SG&A costs. Net earnings also benefitted from a lower tax rate in 2017. These benefits were partially offset by the increase in net non-operating expenses, discussed above. Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $420 million in 2017 due to weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar, including those in Argentina, Nigeria, Egypt and the United Kingdom. This impact includes both transactional charges as discussed above in Operating Costs and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.Net earnings from discontinued operations increased $4.6 billion in 2017 to $5.2 billion. This change was driven by the $5.3 billion gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands in the current year, partially offset by the impact of the base period results, which included the net earnings of the Batteries and Beauty Brands businesses prior to divestiture, a gain on the sale of the Batteries business and impairment charges on the Batteries business prior to divestiture (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $4.8 billion, or 46%, to $15.3 billion.Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.20, or 6%, to $3.69 due to the increase in net earnings from continuing operations and a reduction in the number of weighted average shares outstanding following the shares tendered in the sale of the Beauty Brands to Coty (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), along with ongoing share repurchases.Diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations were $1.90. This was an increase of $1.70 per share versus the prior year primarily resulting from the gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands. Diluted net earnings per share increased $1.90, or 51%, to $5.59.Core EPS increased 7% to $3.92. Core EPS in fiscal year 2017 represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the charge related to early extinguishment of long-term debt and incremental restructuring charges related to our productivity and cost savings plan. The increase was driven by operating margin expansion, lower effective tax rate and the reduction in the number of weighted average shares outstanding discussed above.20 The Procter & Gamble CompanySEGMENT RESULTSSegment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation.

These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; certain employee benefit costs; other general corporate items; gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling item is income taxes, to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. For 2018, the tax impact also includes the impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, which were included in the corporate segment.Fiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017Corporate net sales decreased 2% to $497 million in 2018 due to a decrease in the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings/(loss) from continuing operations decreased by $380 million in 2018, primarily due to:•an increase in income tax expense in 2018 caused by the aforementioned $602 million net charge for the transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act and•an increase in after-tax restructuring charges of approximately $331 million.These costs were partially offset by lower charges related to the early extinguishment of long-term debt in 2018 versus 2017, the lower tax rate on current year earnings as a result of the U.S. Tax Act and an increase in the proportion of corporate overhead spending allocated to the segments.Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016Corporate net sales increased 20%, or $83 million, to $505 million in 2017 primarily due to an increase in the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings from continuing operations improved by approximately $421 million in 2017, primarily due to:•lower restructuring charges in 2017 compared to the prior year,•a gain on the sale of real estate in the current fiscal year, •lower foreign exchange transactional charges,•a reduction in the proportion of corporate overhead spending not allocated to the segments, consisting in part of reduced stranded overheads following divestitures, and•current year tax benefits resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard on the tax impacts of share-based payments to employees (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).These benefits were partially offset by a $345 million after-tax charge on the early extinguishment of long-term debt in fiscal 2017 and lower gains from minor brand divestitures compared to 2016.Restructuring Program to deliver Productivity and Cost SavingsIn 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. In 2017, the Company communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings program.The current productivity and cost savings plan will further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. As part of this plan, the Company incurred approximately $1.1 billion in total before- tax restructuring costs in fiscal 2018, with an additional amount of approximately $0.8 billion expected in fiscal 2019. This program is expected to result in additional enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Savings generated from restructuring costs are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of The Procter & Gamble Company 25reinvestment. However, we estimate that through 2018, the underlying restructuring costs and other non-manufacturing enrollment reductions since 2012 have delivered approximately $3.3 billion in annual before-tax gross savings.Restructuring accruals of $513 million as of June 30, 2018 are classified as current liabilities. Approximately 65% of the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2018 either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting.In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins.Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program and to the Operating Costs section of the MD&A for more information about the total benefit to operating margins from our total savings efforts.CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates.Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.Operating Cash FlowFiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 Operating cash flow was $14.9 billion in 2018, a 17% increase from the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, loss on extinguishment of debt, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets) generated $11.4 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts generated $3.5 billion of operating cash flow as summarized below.•An increase in accounts receivable used $177 million of cash due to increased sales and the timing of the year-end (which fell on a weekend, resulting in fewer days collection). The number of days sales outstanding remained flat versus prior year.•Higher inventory used $188 million of cash mainly due to inventory increases to support initiatives and business growth across all segments. Inventory days on hand decreased approximately 1 day primarily due to foreign exchange impacts. •Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $1.4 billion of cash. This was primarily driven by extended payment terms with our suppliers and an increase in fourth quarter marketing activity versus the prior year. These factors, along with offsetting impacts of foreign exchange, drove a 2 day increase in days payable outstanding. Although difficult to project due to market and other dynamics, we anticipate incremental cash flow benefits from the extended payment terms with suppliers could decline slightly over the next fiscal year.•Other operating assets and liabilities generated $2.0 billion of cash, primarily driven by the long-term portion of the payable related to the U.S. Tax Act repatriation charge.Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Operating cash flow was $12.8 billion in 2017, a 17% decrease from the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes, loss/(gain) on sale of assets and impairment charges) and the loss on early extinguishment of debt generated $13.0 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts used $281 million of operating cash flow.•An increase in accounts receivable used $322 million of cash due to higher relative sales late in the period as compared to the prior period, partially offset by collection of approximately $150 million of retained receivables from the Beauty Brands business. In addition, the number of days sales outstanding increased 1 day due in part to foreign exchange impacts. •Lower inventory generated $71 million of cash mainly due to supply chain optimizations, partially offset by increases to support business growth and increased commodity costs. Inventory days on hand decreased approximately 1 day primarily due to supply chain optimizations. •Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities decreased, using $149 million in operating cash flow. This was caused by reduced accruals from lower fourth quarter marketing and overhead activities as compared to the base period, as well as the payment of approximately $595 million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to the divestiture of the Beauty Brands business, including liabilities retained by the Company pursuant to the terms of the agreement. These impacts were partially offset by approximately $700 million related to extended payment terms with our suppliers. These factors, along with the impact of foreign exchange, drove a 4 day increase in days payable outstanding. •Other operating assets and liabilities used $43 million of cash.Adjusted Free Cash Flow. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding tax payments related to certain divestitures and is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation. 26 The Procter & Gamble CompanyFiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 Adjusted free cash flow was $11.2 billion in 2018, an increase of 14% versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in operating cash flows as discussed above. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings, excluding the transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act and the loss on early extinguishment of debt, was 104% in 2018. Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Adjusted free cash flow was $9.8 billion in 2017, a decrease of 19% versus the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in operating cash flows. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings, excluding the loss on debt extinguishment and impacts of the sale of the Beauty Brands, was 94% in 2017. Investing Cash FlowFiscal year 2018 compared with fiscal year 2017 Net investing activities consumed $3.5 billion in cash in 2018 mainly due to capital spending and purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by proceeds from asset sales and sales and maturities of short-term investments. Fiscal year 2017 compared with fiscal year 2016 Net investing activities consumed $5.7 billion in cash in 2017 mainly due to capital spending and purchases of short-term investments, partially offset by proceeds from asset sales, transactions related to the close of the Beauty Brands divestiture and sales and maturities of short-term investments. Capital Spending. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost efficiencies, were $3.7 billion in 2018 and $3.4 billion in 2017. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased 40 basis points to 5.6% in 2018. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales was 5.2% in 2017.Acquisitions. Acquisition activity used cash of $109 million in 2018, primarily related to acquisitions in the Beauty segment. Acquisition activity was not material in 2017. Proceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales in 2018 contributed $269 million in cash, primarily from minor brand divestitures. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $571 million in cash in 2017 primarily from real estate sales and other minor brand divestitures. In fiscal 2017, the Company invested an additional $874 million of cash, received from the issuance of debt, in restricted cash. At the closing of the Beauty Brands transaction, $1.9 billion of restricted cash (including the $874 million invested in 2017) was released and returned to cash and cash equivalents and $475 million of cash was transferred to the discontinued Beauty Brands business.Financing Cash FlowDividend Payments. Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments. Dividends per common share increased 3.3% to $2.79 per share in 2018. Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $7.3 billion in 2018 and $7.2 billion in 2017. In April 2018, the Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.6896 to $0.7172 per share on Common Stock and Series A and B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock. This represents a 4% increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 62nd consecutive year that our dividend has increased. We have paid a dividend for 128 years, every year since our incorporation in 1890.Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $31.3 billion as of June 30, 2018 and $31.6 billion as of June 30, 2017.Treasury Purchases. Total share repurchases were $7.0 billion in 2018 and $5.2 billion in 2017. LiquidityAt June 30, 2018, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $4.9 billion, largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. As of June 30, 2018, $11.4 billion of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was held off-shore by foreign subsidiaries. This balance has declined versus the prior year primarily due to cash repatriations following the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act. Under current law, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future. Of the June 30, 2018 balance of off-shore cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, the majority relates to various Western European countries. As of June 30, 2018, we did not have material cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds.We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled, and should continue to enable, us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements.On June 30, 2018, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard & Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings were Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard & Poor's), all with a stable outlook.We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $8.0 billion facility split between a $3.2 billion five-year facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire in November 2022 and November 2018, respectively. Both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms The Procter & Gamble Company 27of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities. For additional details on debt see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.Contractual CommitmentsThe following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2018.Amounts in millionsTotal Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 YearsRECORDED LIABILITIES Total debt$31,217 $10,407 $4,630 $5,224 $10,956Capital leases107 22 35 23 27U.S. Tax Act transitional charge (1)2,884 231 462 462 1,730Uncertain tax positions (2)— — — — —OTHER Interest payments relating to long-term debt4,944 574 1,033 811 2,526Operating leases (3)1,338 275 442 325 296Minimum pension funding (4)402 131 271 — —Purchase obligations (5)1,129 778 167 47 137TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS$42,021 $12,418 $7,039 $6,891 $15,673(1) Represents the U.S. federal tax liability associated with the repatriation provisions of the U.S. Tax Act. Does not include any provisions made for foreign withholding taxes on expected repatriations as the timing of those payments is uncertain.(2) As of June 30, 2018, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $584 million, including $114 million of interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of June 30, 2018, cannot be made.(3) Operating lease obligations are shown net of guaranteed sublease income.(4) Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2020 are not currently determinable.(5) Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent minimum commitments under take-or-pay agreements with suppliers and are in line with expected usage. This includes service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. Such amounts also include arrangements with suppliers that qualify as embedded operating leases. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include revenue recognition, income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.The Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.Revenue RecognitionSales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned. For us, this generally means revenue is recognized when title to the product, ownership and risk of loss transfer to the customer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. Trade promotions, 28 The Procter & Gamble Companyconsisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, in-store merchandising funds, advertising and other promotional activities, and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred, generally at the time of the sale. Amounts accrued for trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation, based on contractual terms, customer performance, sales volumes and historical utilization and redemption rates. The actual amounts paid may be different from such estimates. These differences, which have historically not been significant, are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. The Company will adopt ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” on July 1, 2018. Adoption of this standard will result in a change in the timing of recognition of certain trade promotional spending. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, and our ability to uphold certain tax positions.Realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.A core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model, such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities. However, because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts, we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various cross-border transactions. We have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty. We estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70% of our global earnings. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. For additional details on the Company's income taxes, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Employee BenefitsWe sponsor various post-employment benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPEB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2018, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPEB assets was 6.8% and 8.3%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPEB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $115 million.Since pension and OPEB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined The Procter & Gamble Company 29benefit pension plans of 2.5% represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $190 million. The average discount rate on the OPEB plan of 4.2% reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the U.S., which is where a majority of the plan participants receive benefits. A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax OPEB expense by approximately $65 million. For additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsSignificant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations. We typically estimate the fair value of these assets using the income method, which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. The valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin progression, Company business plans and the discount rate applied to cash flows.Indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized, but are tested separately at least annually for impairment. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. For example, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. In addition, changes to, or a failure to achieve business plans or deterioration of macroeconomic conditions could result in reduced cash flows or higher discount rates, leading to a lower valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses.We test individual indefinite lived intangible assets by comparing the book value of each asset to the estimated fair value. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets. The test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two step process. In the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a second step to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. The second step of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting unit's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination. If the resulting implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment.Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, all customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. An impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high. Both of these wholly-acquired reporting units have fair value cushions (the fair values currently exceed the underlying carrying values). However, the overall Shave Care cushion, as well as the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset cushion, have both been reduced to below 10%, both due in large part to an increased competitive market environment, a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits and significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar that have occurred in recent years, and which has contributed to reduced cash flow projections. As a result, this reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset are more susceptible to impairment risk.The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the residual net sales and earnings growth rates and discount rate. The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the 10-year time horizon. The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans, and approximates expected long term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate is dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is 30 The Procter & Gamble Companyconsistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar and changes in expected rates of inflation. While management can and has implemented strategies to address these events, significant changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of the business unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. As of June 30, 2018, the carrying values of Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are $19.5 billion and $15.7 billion, respectively.The table below provides a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite lived intangible asset, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the residual net sales growth rate and the discount rate, to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 50 basis point decrease to our residual net sales growth rate or a 50 basis point increase to our discount rate. Given the size of the fair value cushions, changes in the assumptions of this magnitude would result in an impairment of the underlying goodwill and could result in an impairment of the indefinite lived intangible asset.

We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. Except within financing operations, we leverage the Company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments.Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the RiskManager™ value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics™ dataset as of June 30, 2018. In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics™, a reasonable proxy is included.Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term.Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments.Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June 30, 2018, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements.Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps with maturities of less than 18 months. In addition, we have entered into certain currency swaps with maturities of up to five years to hedge our exposure to exchange rate movements on intercompany financing transactions.Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2018, we The Procter & Gamble Company 31believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact on such instruments of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements.Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures.As of and during the years ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, we did not have any commodity hedging activity.Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAPIn accordance with the SEC's Regulation G, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business trends (i.e. trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. These measures include:Organic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of the India Goods & Services Tax changes, the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation, acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis, and this measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth:Year ended June 30, 2018Net Sales GrowthForeign Exchange ImpactAcquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other (1)Organic Sales GrowthBeauty9 %(2)%—%7 %Grooming(1)%(3)%1%(3)%Health Care5 %(3)%—%2 %Fabric & Home Care3 %(1)%1%3 %Baby, Feminine & Family Care(1)%(1)%—%(2)%TOTAL COMPANY3 %(2)%—%1 % Year ended June 30, 2017Net Sales GrowthForeign Exchange ImpactAcquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other (2)Organic Sales GrowthBeauty— %2 %1%3 %Grooming(3)%2 %1%— %Health Care2 %2 %1%5 %Fabric & Home Care— %2 %1%3 %Baby, Feminine & Family Care(1)%2 %—%1 %TOTAL COMPANY— %2 %—%2 %(1) Acquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other includes the volume and mix impact of acquisitions and divestitures, the impact of the India Goods and Services Tax implementation and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales.(2) Acquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other includes the volume and mix impact of acquisitions and divestitures, the impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales.Adjusted Free Cash Flow. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding certain divestiture impacts (tax payments related to certain divestitures). Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment.The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow ($ millions): OperatingCash FlowCapitalSpendingDivestiture impacts (1)Adjusted FreeCash Flow2018$14,867$(3,717)$—$11,150201712,753(3,384)4189,787201615,435(3,314)—12,121(1) Divestiture impacts relate to tax payments for the Beauty Brands divestiture in fiscal 2017.32 The Procter & Gamble CompanyAdjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act, the losses on early debt extinguishment, the gain on the sale of the Batteries and Beauty Brands businesses and Batteries impairments. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow productivity ($ millions): NetEarningsAdjustments to Net Earnings (1)Net Earnings Excluding AdjustmentsAdjusted Free Cash FlowAdjusted FreeCash FlowProductivity2018$9,861$845$10,706$11,150104%201715,411(4,990)10,4219,78794%201610,604(72)10,53212,121115%(1) Adjustments to Net Earnings relate to the transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act in fiscal 2018, the losses on early debt extinguishment in fiscal 2018 and 2017, the gain on the sale of the Beauty Brands business in 2017, and the gain on the sale of the Batteries business and the Batteries impairment in fiscal 2016.Core EPS. Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. The table below provides a reconciliation of diluted net earnings per share to Core EPS, including the following reconciling items:•Incremental Restructuring: The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. In 2012, the Company began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that includes incremental restructuring activities. In 2017, we communicated details of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings plan. This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. •Transitional Impacts of the U.S. Tax Act: As discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “U.S. Tax Act”) in December 2017. This resulted in a net charge of $602 million for the fiscal year 2018. The adjustment to core earnings only includes this transitional impact. It does not include the ongoing impacts of the lower U.S. statutory rate on current year earnings. •Early debt extinguishment charges: In fiscal 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded after-tax charges of $243 million and $345 million, respectively, due to the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt. These charges represent the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished. •Charges for certain European legal matters: Several countries in Europe issued separate complaints alleging that the Company, along with several other companies, engaged in violations of competition laws in prior periods. In 2016, the Company incurred after-tax charges of $11 million to adjust legal reserves related to these matters. We do not view the above items to be indicative of underlying business results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.The Procter & Gamble Company 33THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES(Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Reconciliation of Non-GAAP MeasuresTwelve Months Ended June 30, 2018 AS REPORTED (GAAP) INCREMENTAL RESTRUCTURING TRANSITIONAL IMPACTS OF THE U.S. TAX ACT EARLY DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT ROUNDING NON-GAAP (CORE)COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD$34,268 $(724) $— $(1) $33,543SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE18,853 (15) — 1 18,839OPERATING INCOME 13,711 739 — — 14,450INCOME TAX ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS3,465 129 (602) 103 — 3,095NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO P&G9,750 610 602 243 (1) 11,204 Core EPSDILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE* $3.67 $0.23 $0.23 $0.09 $— $4.22* Diluted net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Management's Discussion and AnalysisForward-Looking StatementsCertain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including without limitation, the following sections: “Management's Discussion and Analysis” and “Risk Factors.” These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein is included, without limitation, in the section titled ""Economic Conditions and Uncertainties"" and the section titled “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise.The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections:•Overview•Summary of 2019 Results •Economic Conditions and Uncertainties•Results of Operations•Segment Results•Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity•Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates•Other InformationThroughout the MD&A we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, foreign exchange and the fiscal 2019 adoption of new accounting standards for ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) from year-over-year comparisons. Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending and transitional tax payments related to the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding certain one-time items. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures.Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal-year-to-date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months.OVERVIEWProcter & Gamble is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We also sell direct to consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products, as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.12 The Procter & Gamble CompanyORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTUREIn fiscal 2019, our organizational structure was comprised of Global Business Units (GBUs), Selling and Market Operations (SMOs), Global Business Services (GBS) and Corporate Functions (CF).Global Business UnitsOur GBUs are organized into ten product categories. Under U.S. GAAP, the GBUs underlying the ten product categories are aggregated into five reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric & Home Care; and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. The GBUs are responsible for developing overall brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovations and marketing plans. The following provides additional detail on our reportable segments and the ten product categories and brand composition within each segment.Reportable Segments% ofNet Sales (1)% of NetEarnings (1)Product Categories (Sub-Categories)Major BrandsBeauty19%22%Hair Care (Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments)Head & Shoulders, Herbal Essences, Pantene, RejoiceSkin and Personal Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care)Olay, Old Spice, Safeguard, SK-II, SecretGrooming9%13%Grooming (2) (Shave Care - Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care; Appliances)Braun, Gillette, VenusHealth Care12%13%Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care)Crest, Oral-BPersonal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Pain Relief, Other Personal Health Care)Metamucil, Neurobion, Pepto Bismol, VicksFabric & Home Care33%29%Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents)Ariel, Downy, Gain, TideHome Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care)Cascade, Dawn, Fairy, Febreze, Mr. Clean, SwifferBaby, Feminine & Family Care27%23%Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants)Luvs, PampersFeminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care)Always, Always Discreet, TampaxFamily Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper)Bounty, Charmin, Puffs(1) Percent of Net sales and Net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2019 (excluding results held in Corporate).(2) The Grooming product category is comprised of the Shave Care and Appliances GBUs. Recent Developments: During fiscal 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of the over the counter (OTC) healthcare business of Merck KGaA (Merck OTC) for $3.7 billion (based on exchange rates at the time of closing). This business primarily sells OTC consumer healthcare products, mainly in Europe, Latin America and Asia markets. Total sales for the business during Merck OTC's most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $1 billion. During fiscal 2019, the Company also dissolved our PGT Healthcare partnership, a venture between the Company and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd (Teva) in the OTC consumer healthcare business. Pursuant to the agreement, PGT product assets were returned to the original respective parent companies to reestablish independent OTC businesses. This transaction was accounted for as a sale of the Teva portion of the PGT business. The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the sale of $353 million. During fiscal 2017, the Company completed the divestiture of four product categories, which included 43 of the Company's beauty brands (""Beauty Brands""), including the global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and the fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. The Beauty Brands had historically been part of the Company’s Beauty reportable segment. The results of the Beauty Brands are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, are excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Refer to Notes 13 and 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on each of these transactions.Organization Design Changes:The Company recently announced changes to our organization design effective July 1, 2019. In the new design, the ten product categories are being organized into six Sector Business Units (SBUs). The SBUs will be responsible for global brand strategy, innovation and supply chain. They will have direct profit responsibility for markets representing the large majority The Procter & Gamble Company 13of the Company's sales and earnings (referred to as Focus Markets) and will be responsible for innovation plans, supply plans and operating frameworks to drive growth and value creation in the remaining markets (referred to as Enterprise Markets). For segment reporting purposes, the categories will continue to be aggregated into the same five external reporting segments.Beauty: We are a global market leader in the beauty category. Most of the beauty markets in which we compete are highly fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. We compete in skin and personal care and in hair care. In skin and personal care, we offer a wide variety of products, ranging from deodorants to personal cleansing to skin care, such as our Olay brand, which is one of the top facial skin care brands in the world with nearly 6% global market share. We are the global market leader in the retail hair care market with over 20% global market share primarily behind our Pantene and Head & Shoulders brands. Grooming: We compete in shave care and appliances. In shave care, we are the global market leader in the blades and razors market. Our global blades and razors market share is over 60%, primarily behind the Gillette franchise, including our Fusion, Mach3, Prestobarba and Venus brands. Our appliances, such as electric shavers and epilators, are sold under the Braun brand in a number of markets around the world where we compete against both global and regional competitors. We hold nearly 25% of the male electric shavers market and over 50% of the female epilators market.Health Care: We compete in oral care and personal health care. In oral care, there are several global competitors in the market and we have the number two market share position with nearly 20% global market share behind our Oral-B and Crest brands. In personal health care, we are a top ten competitor in a large, highly fragmented industry, primarily behind respiratory treatments (Vicks brand) and digestive wellness products (Metamucil, Pepto Bismol and Align brands). As discussed above, in fiscal 2019, we dissolved the PGT Healthcare partnership with Teva, which previously managed nearly all of our personal health care sales outside the U.S., and reestablished independent OTC businesses. We also acquired Merck OTC as discussed above. Fabric & Home Care: This segment is comprised of a variety of fabric care products, including laundry detergents, additives and fabric enhancers; and home care products, including dishwashing liquids and detergents, surface cleaners and air fresheners. In fabric care, we generally have the number one or number two market share position in the markets in which we compete and are the global market leader with over 25% global market share, primarily behind our Tide, Ariel and Downy brands. Our global home care market share is over 20% across the categories in which we compete.Baby, Feminine & Family Care: In baby care, we are the global market leader and compete mainly in taped diapers, pants and baby wipes with over 25% global market share. We have the number one or number two market share position in most of the key markets in which we compete, primarily behind Pampers, the Company's largest brand, with annual net sales of nearly $8 billion. We are the global market leader in the feminine care category with 25% global market share, primarily behind Always. We also compete in the adult incontinence category in certain markets behind Always Discreet, achieving nearly 10% market share in most of the markets where we compete. Our family care business is predominantly a North American business comprised largely of the Bounty paper towel and Charmin toilet paper brands. U.S. market shares are over 40% for Bounty and over 25% for Charmin.Selling and Market OperationsOur SMOs are responsible for developing and executing go-to-market plans at the local level. The SMOs include dedicated retail customer, trade channel and country-specific teams. Our SMOs are organized under six regions, comprised of North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Greater China and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA). Throughout the MD&A, we reference business results in developed markets, which are comprised of North America, Western Europe and Japan, and developing markets, which are all other markets not included in developed. As a result of the above-mentioned changes in our organization design effective July 1, 2019, we will be organized under five regions, with Asia Pacific and IMEA being combined into a single region. Corporate FunctionsCorporate Functions provides company-level strategy and portfolio analysis, corporate accounting, treasury, tax, external relations, governance, human resources and legal, as well as other centralized functional support.Global Business ServicesGBS provides technology, processes and standard data tools to enable the GBUs, the SMOs and Corporate Functions to better understand the business and better serve consumers and customers. The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class solutions at a low cost and with minimal capital investment.STRATEGIC FOCUSProcter & Gamble aspires to serve the world’s consumers better than our best competitors in every category and in every country in which we compete, and, as a result, deliver total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. Delivering and sustaining leadership levels of shareholder value creation requires balanced top-line growth, bottom-line growth and strong cash generation.Our strategic choices are focused on winning with consumers. The consumers who purchase and use our products are at the center of everything we do. We win with consumers by delivering superiority across the five key elements of product, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value equation.Winning with consumers around the world and against our best competitors requires innovation. Innovation has always been, and continues to be, P&G’s lifeblood. Innovation requires consumer insights and technology advancements that lead to product improvements, improved marketing and 14 The Procter & Gamble Companymerchandising programs and game-changing inventions that create new brands and categories. Productivity improvement is critical to delivering our balanced top-line growth, bottom-line growth and value creation objectives. Productivity improvement and sales growth reinforce and fuel each other. We are driving productivity improvement across all elements of cost, including cost of goods sold, marketing and promotional expenses and non-manufacturing overhead. Productivity improvements and cost savings are being reinvested in product and packaging improvements, brand awareness-building advertising and trial-building sampling programs, increased sales coverage and R&D programs.We are improving operational effectiveness and organizational culture through enhanced clarity of roles and responsibilities, accountability and incentive compensation programs.The Company has undertaken an effort to focus and strengthen its business portfolio to compete in categories and with brands that are structurally attractive and that play to P&G's strengths. The ongoing portfolio of businesses consists of 10 product categories. These are categories where P&G has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies.We believe these strategies are right for the long-term health of the Company and our objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group.The Company expects the delivery of the following long-term annual financial targets will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive peer group:•Organic sales growth above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete;•Core EPS growth of mid-to-high single digits; and•Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater.In periods with significant macroeconomic pressures, we intend to maintain a disciplined approach to investing so as not to sacrifice the long-term health of our businesses to meet short-term objectives in any given year.SUMMARY OF 2019 RESULTSAmounts in millions, except per share amounts2019 2018 Change vs. Prior YearNet sales$67,684 $66,832 1 %Operating income5,487 13,363 (59)%Net earnings3,966 9,861 (60)%Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble3,897 9,750 (60)%Diluted net earnings per common share1.43 3.67 (61)%Core earnings per share4.52 4.22 7 %Cash flow from operating activities15,242 14,867 3 %•Net sales increased 1% to $67.7 billion on a 3% increase in unit volume. Foreign exchange had a negative 4% impact on net sales. Net sales growth was driven by mid-single digit increases in Beauty and Health Care and a low single digit increase in Fabric & Home Care, partially offset by a low single digit decline in Baby, Feminine & Family Care and a mid-single digit decline in Grooming.◦Organic sales increased 5% on a 2% increase in organic volume. Organic sales increased high single digits in Beauty and Fabric & Home Care, increased mid-single digits in Health Care and increased low single digits in Grooming and Baby, Feminine & Family Care.◦Unit volumes increased 3%. Volume increased mid-single digits in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care and increased low single digits in Beauty and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Volume decreased low single digits in Grooming. •Operating income decreased $7.9 billion, or 59%, due primarily to non-cash impairment charges of $8.3 billion related to Shave Care goodwill and Gillette indefinite-lived intangible assets (Shave Care impairment), partially offset by the benefit from the net sales increase. For a more detailed discussion on the Shave Care impairment refer to the Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates section in the MD&A and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.•Net earnings decreased $5.9 billion or 60% due to the after-tax impact of the Shave Care impairment, partially offset by a reduction in current year income tax expense, a current year gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership and the base period charges for the early extinguishment of debt. The reduction in current year income tax expense was driven by the impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 (U.S. Tax Act), comprised of the reduction in tax rate on the current year earnings and the base period charges related to the transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act. Foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings by approximately $900 million. •Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $3.9 billion, a decrease of $5.9 billion or 60% versus the prior year primarily due to the aforementioned items.•Diluted net earnings per share decreased 61% to $1.43.◦Core EPS increased 7% to $4.52.•Cash flow from operating activities was $15.2 billion.◦Adjusted free cash flow was $12.1 billion.◦Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 105%.The Procter & Gamble Company 15ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIESWe discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are ""forward-looking statements"" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.Global Economic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macro-economic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-dependent economies, greater political unrest in the Middle East, Central & Eastern Europe and the Korean peninsula, economic uncertainty related to the execution of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, political instability in certain Latin American and Asian markets and overall economic slowdowns, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our earnings.Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. If we are unable to manage commodity and other cost fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings. Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. As discussed later in this MD&A, in 2012 we initiated overhead and supply chain cost improvement projects. In fiscal 2017, we communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year cost reduction program which is resulting in enrollment reductions and other savings. If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings.Foreign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In four of the past five years, including fiscal 2019, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies, leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Russia, Turkey, Brazil, China and the United Kingdom have had, and could continue to have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales and profits. Government Policies. Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies, for example, the U.S. Tax Act, the implications and uncertainties of which are disclosed elsewhere in this report. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt and Turkey. Further, our earnings and sales could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere, including increases of import tariffs, both currently effective and future potential changes. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, operating margin and net earnings.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe key metrics included in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative costs (SG&A), other non-operating items and income taxes. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of initiatives, pricing and other activities by competitors), marketing spending, retail executions, both in-store and online and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as our pricing actions (which can also indirectly impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the U.S.Most of our cost of products sold and SG&A are to some extent variable in nature. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in developed markets are generally higher than in developing markets for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input 16 The Procter & Gamble Companycosts may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for example, product or package improvements) and to a lesser extent scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary components of SG&A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. While overhead costs are variable to some extent, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems infrastructures to support business growth.A detailed discussion of the fiscal 2018 year-over-year changes can be found in the MD&A section in the Form 8-K filed October 22, 2018, which updated our Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018, to revise disclosures to reflect the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASU 2017-07 and 2016-18. For more information on the adoption of this standard, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Net SalesNet sales increased 1% to $67.7 billion in 2019 on a 3% increase in unit volume versus the prior year. Volume increased mid-single digits in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care and increased low single digits in Beauty and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Volume decreased low single digits in Grooming. Volume increased mid-single digits in developed regions and low single digits in developing regions. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, organic volume increased low single digits in developed regions. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 4%. Pricing had a positive 2% impact on net sales. Product mix had a positive 1% impact on net sales driven by the slightly higher organic growth of the Skin and Personal Care and Personal Health Care categories and developed regions, all of which have higher than company average selling prices. Organic sales grew 5% driven by a 2% increase in organic volume.Operating CostsComparisons as a percentage of net sales; Years ended June 302019 2018 Basis Point ChangeGross margin48.6% 48.5% 10Selling, general and administrative expense28.2% 28.5% (30)Operating margin8.1% 20.0% (1,190)Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes9.0% 19.9% (1,090)Net earnings5.9% 14.8% (890)Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble5.8% 14.6% (880)Gross margin increased 10 basis points to 48.6% of net sales in 2019. Gross margin benefited 160 basis points from total manufacturing cost savings (130 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments), 60 basis points of positive pricing impacts and 50 basis points from lower restructuring costs. These were offset by:•a 100 basis-point decline from unfavorable product mix and other impacts (primarily mix within segments due to the growth of lower margin product forms and the club channel in certain categories and due to the disproportionate growth of the Fabric Care category, which is one of our largest categories and has lower than company-average gross margins),•an 80 basis-point negative impact due to higher commodity costs and•a 50 basis-point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange.Total SG&A was relatively unchanged at $19.1 billion, as a decrease in marketing spending was offset by an increase in overhead costs and in other net operating expenses. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points to 28.2%. Reductions in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales were partially offset by an increase in overhead costs and other net operating expenses as a percentage of sales.•Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 80 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the organic net sales increase, reductions in agency compensation and the impact of adopting the new standard on ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" which prospectively reclassified certain customer spending from marketing (SG&A) expense to a reduction of net sales.•Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points, as productivity savings and fixed cost leverage from the increased organic net sales, were more than offset by the impact of inflation, higher incentive compensation costs and other cost increases, including the ongoing and integration-related overhead costs of the Merck OTC acquisition.•Other net operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points primarily due to an increase in foreign exchange transactional charges and the net impact of changes in indirect tax reserves, partially offset by the gain on sale of real estate in the current year.The Procter & Gamble Company 17Operating margin decreased 1,190 basis points to 8.1% for fiscal 2019 primarily due to the one-time, non-cash before-tax impairment charge of $8.3 billion for Shave Care.Non-Operating Items•Interest expense was $509 million in 2019, a marginal increase of $3 million versus the prior year due to an increase in average debt balances and an increase in U.S. interest rates.•Interest income was $220 million in 2019, a reduction of $27 million versus the prior year due to a reduction in average investment securities balances.•Other non-operating income, which consists primarily of divestiture gains, investment income and other non-operating items increased $649 million to $871 million, primarily due to a $355 million before-tax gain from the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership in the current year (discussed earlier in the Recent Developments section) and $346 million of base year charges for the early extinguishment of debt, partially offset by higher minor brand divestiture gains in the base year. Income TaxesIncome taxes decreased $1.4 billion to $2.1 billion. The effective tax rate increased 870 basis points to 34.7% in 2019. The current year Shave Care impairment charges caused a 1,750 basis-point increase in the effective tax rate, as there is no tax benefit related to the goodwill portion of the impairment. Excluding this impact, the effective tax rate declined 880 basis points, primarily due to the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""U.S. Tax Act"") in December 2017. The U.S. Tax Act, among other things, lowered the U.S. corporate income tax rates, but also imposed a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries and caused us to adjust our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower federal base rate of 21%. These transitional impacts resulted in a provisional net charge of $602 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, comprised of an estimated repatriation tax charge of $3.8 billion (comprised of U.S. repatriation taxes and foreign withholding taxes) and an estimated net deferred tax benefit of $3.2 billion. In addition, because the Company has a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate was phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 28% for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, and 21% for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and subsequent fiscal years. Combined, these impacts reduced the current year effective tax rate by 950 basis points, consisting of:•a 500 basis-point reduction from the impact of the lower blended U.S. federal tax rate on current year earnings versus the prior year rate, and•a 450 basis-point reduction due to prior year transitional impacts from the U.S. Tax Act. The remaining 70 basis point net increase in the current year income tax rate was driven by:•a 160 basis-point increase from unfavorable impacts of geographic mix of earnings, •a 10 basis-point increase from reduced favorable discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (which netted to approximately 15 basis points in the current year versus 25 basis points in the prior year), and •a 100 basis-point reduction from increased excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (160 basis points in the current year versus 60 basis points in the prior year).Net EarningsOperating income decreased $7.9 billion, or 59%, primarily due to the $8.3 billion before tax impairment charge for Shave Care. This was partially offset by the net sales increase, along with the marginal increase in gross margin and decrease in SG&A spending as a percentage of sales, all of which are discussed above. Earnings before income taxes decreased $7.3 billion or 54% to $6.1 billion, as the reduction in operating income discussed in the preceding paragraph was partially offset by the current year gain from the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership and the base year charges for the early extinguishment of debt, each of which was discussed earlier. Net earnings decreased $5.9 billion, or 60% to $4.0 billion. Net earnings declined less than earnings before income taxes due to the above discussed reduction in income taxes. Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $900 million in 2019 due to weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar, including those in Argentina, Russia, Turkey, Brazil, China and the United Kingdom. This impact includes both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased $5.9 billion, or 60%, to $3.9 billion. Diluted net earnings per share decreased $2.24, or 61%, to $1.43 due primarily to the reduction in net earnings.Core EPS increased 7% to $4.52. Core EPS represents diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding the current year charge for the Shave Care impairment, the current year gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership, the base year charges for both the net transitional impact of the U.S. Tax Act and for early extinguishment of debt and incremental restructuring charges in both years related to our productivity and cost savings plans. The increase was primarily driven by the lower effective tax rate on core earnings, resulting from the U.S. Tax Act and the net sales increase.18 The Procter & Gamble CompanySEGMENT RESULTSSegment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation.

Global market share of the skin and personal care category was unchanged.Net earnings increased 14% to $2.6 billion in 2019 due to the increase in net sales and a 170 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to a reduction in U.S. income tax rates and a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin. Gross margin decreased slightly mainly due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased primarily due to a reduction in marketing spending driven by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and the impacts of adopting the new accounting standard on ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"". The reduction in the tax rate was due to the impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, both from overall rate reduction and the manner in which the impacts were allocated between the business and corporate segments in the prior year, as discussed in the Corporate segment below.GROOMING($ millions)2019 2018 Change vs. 2018VolumeN/A N/A (1)%Net sales$6,199 $6,551 (5)%Net earnings$1,529 $1,432 7%% of net sales24.7% 21.9% 280 bpsThe Procter & Gamble Company 19Grooming net sales decreased 5% to $6.2 billion in 2019 on a 1% decrease in unit volume.

The net earnings margin increased primarily due to a reduction in U.S. income tax rates and a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin. Gross margin declined due to the negative impact of unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of disposable razors, lower tier products in the Appliances category and large count packs all of which have lower than segment average margins), unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and increased commodity costs, partially offset by the positive impacts of manufacturing cost savings and increased pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to a current year gain on the sale of operating real estate, reductions in overhead costs and marketing spending and the impacts from adoption of the new accounting standard on ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"". The reduction in the tax rate was primarily due to the impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, both from the overall rate reduction and the manner in which the impacts were allocated between the business and corporate segments in the prior year, as discussed in the Corporate segment below.HEALTH CARE($ millions)2019 2018 Change vs. 2018VolumeN/A N/A 5%Net sales$8,218 $7,857 5%Net earnings$1,519 $1,283 18%% of net sales18.5% 16.3% 220 bpsHealth Care net sales increased 5% to $8.2 billion in 2019 on a 5% increase in unit volume.

The reduction in the tax rate was due to the impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, both from the overall rate reduction and the manner in which the impacts were allocated between business and corporate segments in the prior year, as discussed in the Corporate segment below.The Procter & Gamble Company 21CORPORATE($ millions)2019 2018 Change vs. 2018Net sales$484 $497 (3)%Net earnings/(loss)$(7,971) $(133) N/ACorporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; certain employee benefit costs; other general corporate items; gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; certain asset impairment charges; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. For 2018, the tax impact also includes the impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, which were included in the corporate segment.Corporate net sales decreased 3% to $484 million in 2019 due to a decrease in the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net loss increased by $7.8 billion in 2019 primarily due to the $8.0 billion after tax ($8.3 billion before tax) charge for the Shave Care impairment as well as the impact of the allocation methodology of the lower U.S. Tax rates. The U.S. Tax Act was enacted in the middle of fiscal 2018; therefore, the net benefit was held in Corporate. Beginning in fiscal 2019, the lower rates are included in the reporting segments. These impacts were partially offset by the following benefits, each of which was discussed earlier:•the base period net charge for the transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act,•the base period loss on early debt extinguishment,•lower restructuring charges in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year and•higher current year divestiture gains (primarily driven by gain on the dissolution of the PGT healthcare partnership) Restructuring Program to deliver Productivity and Cost SavingsIn 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. In 2017, the Company communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings program.The current productivity and cost savings plan will further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. As part of this plan, the Company incurred approximately $1.8 billion in total before- tax restructuring costs across 2018 and 2019, with an additional amount of approximately $0.6 billion expected in 2020. This program is expected to result in additional enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Savings generated from restructuring costs are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. However, we estimate that through 2019, the underlying restructuring costs incurred since 2012 (approximately $7.4 billion), along with other non-manufacturing enrollment reductions since 2012 have delivered approximately $3.6 billion in annual before-tax gross savings. Restructuring accruals of $468 million as of June 30, 2019 are classified as current liabilities. Approximately 67% of the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2019 either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting.In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins.Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program and to the Operating Costs section of the MD&A for more information about the total benefit to operating margins from our total savings efforts.CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates.Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.Operating Cash FlowOperating cash flow was $15.2 billion in 2019, a 3% increase from the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes, gain on sale of assets and goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges) generated approximately $14.6 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts generated $0.7 billion of operating cash flow as summarized below.•An increase in accounts receivable used $276 million of cash due to increased sales and the timing of the end of the fiscal year (which fell on a weekend, resulting in fewer 22 The Procter & Gamble Companydays collection). The number of days sales outstanding increased approximately one day versus prior year.•Higher inventory used $239 million of cash mainly due to inventory increases to support initiatives and business growth across all segments. Inventory days on hand increased approximately 2 days primarily due to initiative support and foreign exchange impacts. •Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $1.9 billion of cash. This was primarily driven by extended payment terms with our suppliers and an increase in fourth quarter marketing activity versus the prior year. These factors, along with foreign exchange, drove an approximate 8 day increase in days payable outstanding. Although difficult to project due to market and other dynamics, we anticipate incremental cash flow benefits from the extended payment terms with suppliers could decline in fiscal 2020.•Other operating assets and liabilities used $1.0 billion of cash, primarily driven by the payment of the current year portion of taxes due related to the U.S. Tax Act repatriation charge and statutory pension contributions.Adjusted Free Cash Flow. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act, and it is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation. Adjusted free cash flow was $12.1 billion in 2019, an increase of 9% versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in operating cash flows as discussed above. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings, excluding the Shave Care impairment charges and the gain on dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership, was 105% in 2019. Investing Cash FlowNet investing activities consumed $3.5 billion in cash in 2019, mainly due to capital spending and business acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments. Capital Spending. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost efficiencies, were $3.3 billion in 2019, a decrease of 10% versus prior year. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 70 basis points to 4.9% in 2019. Acquisitions. Acquisition activity used cash of $3.9 billion in 2019, primarily related to the Merck OTC acquisition. Acquisition activity used $109 million in 2018, primarily related to acquisitions in the Beauty segment. Proceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales were $394 million in 2019 primarily from minor brand divestitures and the sale of real estate. Proceeds from asset sales contributed $269 million in cash in 2018 primarily from minor brand divestitures. Short-term investments. Short-term investments generated net cash of $3.5 billion in 2019, primarily from sales and maturities of available-for-sale investments. Net cash flow from short-term investments was not material in 2018.Financing Cash FlowNet financing activities consumed $10.0 billion in cash in 2019, mainly due to dividends to shareholders and treasury stock purchases, partially offset by the impact of stock options. Dividend Payments. Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments. Dividends per common share increased 4% to $2.90 per share in 2019. Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $7.5 billion in 2019 and $7.3 billion in 2018. In April 2019, the Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.7172 to $0.7459 per share on Common Stock and Series A and B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock. This represents a 4% increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 63rd consecutive year that our dividend has increased. We have paid a dividend for 129 consecutive years, every year since our incorporation in 1890.Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $30.1 billion as of June 30, 2019 and $31.3 billion as of June 30, 2018.Treasury Purchases. Total share repurchases were $5.0 billion in 2019 and $7.0 billion in 2018. LiquidityAt June 30, 2019, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $7.5 billion, largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. As of June 30, 2019, $5.7 billion of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was related to foreign subsidiaries, primarily various Western European and Asian countries. Under current law, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future. As of June 30, 2019, we did not have material cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds.We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled, and should continue to enable, us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements.On June 30, 2019, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard & Poor's), while our long-term The Procter & Gamble Company 23credit ratings were Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard & Poor's), all with a stable outlook.We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $8.0 billion facility split between a $3.2 billion four-year facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire in November 2022 and November 2019, respectively. Both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities. For additional details on debt see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.Contractual CommitmentsThe following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2019.Amounts in millionsTotal Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years After 5 YearsRECORDED LIABILITIES Total debt$29,988 $9,695 $4,791 $4,807 $10,695Capital leases33 9 15 7 2U.S. Tax Act transitional charge (1)2,557 214 449 646 1,248Uncertain tax positions (2)143 143 — — —OTHER Interest payments relating to long-term debt4,682 572 979 737 2,394Operating leases1,218 255 375 300 288Minimum pension funding (3)471 153 318 — —Purchase obligations (4)1,491 633 397 193 268TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS$40,583 $11,674 $7,324 $6,690 $14,895(1) Represents the U.S. federal tax liability associated with the repatriation provisions of the U.S. Tax Act. Does not include any provisions made for foreign withholding taxes on expected repatriations as the timing of those payments is uncertain.(2) As of June 30, 2019, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $617 million, including $150 million of interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of June 30, 2019, cannot be made.(3) Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2022 are not currently determinable.(4) Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent minimum commitments under take-or-pay agreements with suppliers and are in line with expected usage. This includes service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include revenue recognition, income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.The Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.Revenue Recognition24 The Procter & Gamble CompanyOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, in-store merchandising funds, advertising and other promotional activities, and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale. Amounts accrued for trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation, based on contractual terms, sales volumes and historical utilization and redemption rates. The actual amounts paid may be different from such estimates. These differences, which have historically not been significant, are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” on July 1, 2018. Adoption of this standard resulted in a change in the timing of recognition of certain trade promotional spending. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, and our ability to uphold certain tax positions.Realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.A core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model, such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities. However, because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts, we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various cross-border transactions. We have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty. We estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70% of our global earnings. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the Company's income taxes.Employee BenefitsWe sponsor various post-employment benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans require assumptions to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPEB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2019, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPEB assets was 6.6% and 8.3%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPEB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $115 million.Since pension and OPEB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts The Procter & Gamble Company 25of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans of 1.9% represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $200 million. The average discount rate on the OPEB plan of 3.7% reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the U.S., which is where a majority of the plan participants receive benefits. A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax OPEB expense by approximately $60 million. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statement for additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsSignificant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations. We typically estimate the fair value of these assets using the income method, which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. The valuations used to establish and to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin progression, Company business plans and the discount rate applied to cash flows.Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized, but are tested at least annually for impairment. Our ongoing annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the 3 months ended December 31. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. For example, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. In addition, changes to, or a failure to achieve business plans or deterioration of macroeconomic conditions could result in reduced cash flows or higher discount rates, leading to a lower valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses.We test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the book value of each asset to the estimated fair value. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. The test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two step process. In the first step (step one), we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a second step (step two) to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. The second step of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting unit's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination. The difference between the step one fair value and the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities in step two is the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If this implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment.Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, all customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. An impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high. The Appliances wholly-acquired reporting unit has a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value. As previously disclosed, the fair value of the Shave Care reporting unit and the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset have been reduced during the recent year to amounts that approximated carrying value. The fair value reductions were due in large part to significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar, a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits, primarily in the developed markets, and an increased competitive market environment in the U.S. and certain other markets, which collectively have resulted in reduced cash flow projections. The business continued to be impacted by these factors during the quarter ended June 30, 2019, which reduced previous estimates of earnings for both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. Because of this, we re-performed our step one impairment tests for these assets as of June 30, 2019 and determined that the fair values have been reduced below their respective carrying values. Therefore, we conducted a step two test of goodwill for the Shave Care reporting unit. Step two requires that we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to identifiable assets and 26 The Procter & Gamble Companyliabilities of the reporting unit, including previously amortized or unrecognized intangible assets. Any residual fair value after this allocation is compared to the goodwill balance and any excess goodwill is charged to expense. The step two test resulted in an implied fair value of the Shave Care goodwill that was below the carrying value. Therefore, we recognized a non-cash before and after-tax impairment charge of $6.8 billion. The resulting carrying value of the Shave Care goodwill is $12.6 billion as of June 30, 2019. As a result of the methodology used in the step two testing, the Shave Care fair value now exceeds the carrying value by approximately 20%. This is primarily due to higher estimated fair values for certain fixed assets and defined lived intangibles assets, both of which have been partially amortized subsequent to their initial acquisition, along with fair values assigned to intangible assets not eligible for recognition in the financial statements. The Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge was $1.6 billion ($1.2 billion after tax). This charge was equal to the difference between its estimated fair value (as calculated in step one) and its carrying value. The resulting carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is $14.1 billion as of June 30, 2019, which is equal to its estimated fair value. As a result, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is more susceptible to future impairment risk.The Shave Care goodwill and Gillette indefinite-lived asset impairment charges are presented as a separate line item in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Irrespective of these impairment charges, the Shave Care business has consistently generated significant earnings and cash flow and will continue to be a strategic business for the Company, with attractive earnings, cash flow and growth opportunities. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates (including residual growth rates) and discount rate. The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period and approximates expected long term category market growth rates. The net sales and earnings growth rates are dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates, business activities that impact market share and input cost fluctuations. As a result, these growth rates could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, an increased competitive environment, increases in input costs or devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. While management can and has implemented strategies to address these events, changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the reporting unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. The table below provides a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorter term and residual growth rates and the discount rate, to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis point increase to discount rate or a 25 basis point decrease to our shorter-term and residual growth rates, both of which would result in incremental impairment charges to the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.

We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. We leverage the Company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility within our financing operations, as discussed below, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments.Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the RiskManager™ value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates The Procter & Gamble Company 27the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics™ dataset as of June 30, 2019. In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics™, a reasonable proxy is included.Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term.Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments.Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June 30, 2019, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements.Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps with maturities of less than 18 months. Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2019, we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact on such instruments of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements.Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures.As of and during the years ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, we did not have any commodity hedging activity. Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAPIn accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business trends (i.e. trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. These measures include:Organic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of the July 1, 2018 adoption of new accounting standards for ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"", acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. The impact of the adoption of the new accounting standard for Revenue from Contracts with Customers is driven by the prospective reclassification of certain customer spending from marketing (SG&A) expense to a reduction of net sales. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis, and this measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.The following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth:Year ended June 30, 2019Net Sales GrowthForeign Exchange ImpactAcquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other (1)Organic Sales GrowthBeauty4 %4%— %8%Grooming(5)%5%1 %1%Health Care5 %3%(2)%6%Fabric & Home Care3 %3%1 %7%Baby, Feminine & Family Care(2)%4%— %2%TOTAL COMPANY1 %4%— %5%(1) Acquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other includes the volume and mix impact of acquisitions and divestitures, the impact from the July 1, 2018 adoption of a new accounting standard for ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales.Adjusted Free Cash Flow. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding certain tax payments related to the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act (the Company incurred a transitional tax liability of approximately $3.8 billion from the U.S. Tax Act, which is payable over a period of 8 years). Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate 28 The Procter & Gamble Companyafter taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow ($ millions): OperatingCash FlowCapitalSpendingAdjustments to Operating Cash Flow (1)Adjusted FreeCash Flow2019$15,242$(3,347)$235$12,1302018$14,867$(3,717)$—$11,150(1) Adjustments to Operating Cash Flow relate to tax payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act.Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding 1) the fiscal 2019 Shave Care impairment and 2) the fiscal 2019 gain on dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent.The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow productivity ($ millions): NetEarningsAdjustments to Net Earnings (1)Net Earnings Excluding AdjustmentsAdjusted Free Cash FlowAdjusted FreeCash FlowProductivity2019$3,966$7,625$11,591$12,130105%(1) Adjustments to Net Earnings relate to the Shave Care impairment charges and the gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership in fiscal 2019.Core EPS. Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. Core EPS is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The table below provides a reconciliation of diluted net earnings per share to Core EPS, including the following reconciling items:•Incremental Restructuring: The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. In 2012, the Company began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that includes incremental restructuring activities. In 2017, we communicated details of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings plan. This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. •Gain on Dissolution of the PGT Healthcare Partnership: The Company dissolved our PGT Healthcare partnership, a venture between the Company and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries, Ltd (Teva) in the OTC consumer healthcare business, during the year ended June 30, 2019. The transaction was accounted for as a sale of the Teva portion of the PGT business; the Company recognized an after-tax gain on the dissolution of $353 million. •Transitional Impacts of the U.S. Tax Act: As discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “U.S. Tax Act”) in December 2017. This resulted in a net charge of $602 million for the fiscal year 2018. The adjustment to core earnings only includes this transitional impact. It does not include the ongoing impacts of the lower U.S. statutory rate on pre-tax earnings. •Early debt extinguishment charges: In fiscal 2018, the Company recorded after-tax charges of $243 million, due to the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt. These charges represent the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished. •Shave Care Impairment: As discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in the Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates section of the MD&A, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company recognized a one-time, non-cash after-tax charge of $8.0 billion ($8.3 billion before tax) to adjust the carrying values of the Shave Care reporting unit. This was comprised of a before and after-tax impairment charge of $6.8 billion related to goodwill and an after-tax impairment charge of $1.2 billion ($1.6 billion before tax) to reduce the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible assets. •Anti-Dilutive Impacts: As discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Shave Care impairment charges caused preferred shares that are normally dilutive (and hence, normally assumed converted for purposes of determining diluted earnings per share) to be anti-dilutive. Accordingly for U.S. GAAP, the preferred shares were not assumed to be converted into common shares for diluted earnings per share and the related dividends paid to the preferred shareholders were deducted from net income to calculate earnings available to common shareholders. As a result of the non-GAAP Shave Care impairment adjustment, these instruments are dilutive for non-GAAP core earnings per share. We do not view the above items to be indicative of underlying business results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.The Procter & Gamble Company 29THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES(Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Reconciliation of Non-GAAP MeasuresTwelve Months Ended June 30, 2019 AS REPORTED (GAAP) ANTI-DILUTIVE IMPACTS INCREMENTAL RESTRUCTURING SHAVE CARE IMPAIRMENT GAIN ON DISSOLUTION OF PGT PARTNERSHIP ROUNDING NON-GAAP (CORE)COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD$34,768 $— $(426) $— $— $— $34,342SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE19,084 — 23 — — (1) 19,106OPERATING INCOME 5,487 — 403 8,345 — 1 14,236INCOME TAX ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS2,103 — 69 367 (2) — 2,537NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO P&G3,897 — 354 7,978 (353) 1 11,877 Core EPSDiluted Net Earnings attributable to common shareholders (1)3,634 263 354 7,978 (353) 1 11,877Diluted Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding (1)2,539.5 90.2 2,629.7DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE$1.43 $0.06 $0.13 $3.03 $(0.13) $— $4.52(1) The reduction in net earnings from current period charge for the Shave Care impairment caused the preferred shares outstanding to be anti-dilutive. Accordingly, for U.S. GAAP, the preferred shares were not assumed to be converted into common shares for diluted earnings per share and the related dividends paid to the preferred shareholders were deducted from net income to calculate earnings available to common shareholders. Excluding the impairment charge results in higher non-GAAP earnings which causes the preferred shares to be dilutive. The adjustments in this row are made to reflect the dilutive preferred share impact resulting from the Shave Care impairment adjustment.

A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein, is included in the section titled ""Economic Conditions and Uncertainties"" and the section titled ""Risk Factors"" (Part I, Item 1A) of this Form 10-K.The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections:•Overview•Summary of 2020 Results •Economic Conditions and Uncertainties•Results of Operations•Segment Results•Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity•Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates•Other InformationThroughout the MD&A we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), consisting of organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending, transitional tax payments related to the U.S. Tax Act and tax payments related to the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and The Procter & Gamble Company 13comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis, relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal-year-to-date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. OVERVIEWProcter & Gamble is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products, as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTUREIn fiscal 2020, our organizational structure was comprised of Sector Business Units (SBUs), Enterprise Markets (EMs), Corporate Functions (CF) and Global Business Services (GBS).Sector Business UnitsOur SBUs are organized into ten product categories. Under U.S. GAAP, the SBUs underlying the ten product categories are aggregated into five reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric & Home Care; and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. The SBUs are responsible for developing overall brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovations and marketing plans. The following provides additional detail on our reportable segments and the ten product categories and brand composition within each segment.Reportable Segments% ofNet Sales (1)% of NetEarnings (1)Product Categories (Sub-Categories)Major BrandsBeauty19%21%Hair Care (Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments)Head & Shoulders, Herbal Essences, Pantene, RejoiceSkin and Personal Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care)Olay, Old Spice, Safeguard, Secret, SK-IIGrooming9%10%Grooming (2) (Shave Care - Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care; Appliances)Braun, Gillette, VenusHealth Care13%12%Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care)Crest, Oral-BPersonal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Pain Relief, Other Personal Health Care)Metamucil, Neurobion, Pepto-Bismol, VicksFabric & Home Care33%31%Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents)Ariel, Downy, Gain, TideHome Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care)Cascade, Dawn, Fairy, Febreze, Mr. Clean, SwifferBaby, Feminine & Family Care26%26%Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants)Luvs, PampersFeminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care)Always, Always Discreet, TampaxFamily Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper)Bounty, Charmin, Puffs(1) Percent of Net sales and Net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended June 30, 2020 (excluding results held in Corporate).(2) The Grooming product category is comprised of the Shave Care and Appliances operating segments. 14 The Procter & Gamble CompanyRecent Developments: During fiscal 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of the over-the-counter (OTC) healthcare business of Merck KGaA (Merck OTC) for $3.7 billion (based on exchange rates at the time of closing). This business primarily sells OTC consumer healthcare products, mainly in markets in Europe, Latin America and Asia. Total sales for the business during Merck OTC's fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $1 billion. Refer to Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on this transaction.During fiscal 2019, the Company also dissolved our PGT Healthcare partnership, a venture between the Company and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd (Teva) in the OTC consumer healthcare business. Pursuant to the agreement, PGT product assets were returned to the original respective parent companies to reestablish independent OTC businesses. This transaction was accounted for as a sale of the Teva portion of the PGT business. The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the sale of $353 million.Organization Design Changes:The Company implemented changes to our organization design effective July 1, 2019. In the new design, the ten product categories were organized into six SBUs. The SBUs are responsible for global brand strategy, innovation and supply chain. They have direct profit responsibility for markets representing the large majority of the Company's sales and earnings (referred to as Focus Markets) and are responsible for innovation plans, supply plans and operating frameworks to drive growth and value creation in the remaining markets (referred to as Enterprise Markets). For segment reporting purposes, the product categories continue to be aggregated into the same five external reporting segments. Throughout the MD&A, we reference business results by region, which are comprised of North America, Europe, Greater China, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA).Beauty: We are a global market leader in the beauty category. Most of the beauty markets in which we compete are highly fragmented with a large number of global and local competitors. We compete in skin and personal care and in hair care. In skin and personal care, we offer a wide variety of products, ranging from deodorants to personal cleansing to skin care, such as our Olay brand, which is one of the top facial skin care brands in the world with approximately 6% global market share. We are the global market leader in the retail hair care market with over 20% global market share primarily behind our Pantene and Head & Shoulders brands. Grooming: We compete in shave care and appliances. In shave care, we are the global market leader in the blades and razors market. Our global blades and razors market share is over 60%, primarily behind our Gillette and Venus brands. Our appliances, such as electric shavers and epilators, are sold under the Braun brand in a number of markets around the world where we compete against both global and regional competitors. We hold nearly 25% of the male electric shavers market and over 50% of the female epilators market.Health Care: We compete in oral care and personal health care. In oral care, there are several global competitors in the market and we have the number two market share position with nearly 20% global market share behind our Crest and Oral-B brands. In personal health care, we are a top ten competitor in a large, highly fragmented industry, primarily behind respiratory treatments (Vicks brand) and digestive wellness products (Metamucil, Pepto Bismol and Align brands). As discussed earlier, in fiscal 2019, we dissolved the PGT Healthcare partnership with Teva, which previously managed nearly all of our personal health care sales outside the U.S., and reestablished an independent OTC business. We also acquired Merck OTC as discussed above. Fabric & Home Care: This segment is comprised of a variety of fabric care products, including laundry detergents, additives and fabric enhancers; and home care products, including dishwashing liquids and detergents, surface cleaners and air fresheners. In fabric care, we generally have the number one or number two market share position in the markets in which we compete and are the global market leader with over 25% global market share, primarily behind our Tide, Ariel and Downy brands. Our global home care market share is approximately 25% across the categories in which we compete primarily behind our Cascade, Dawn, Febreze and Swiffer brands.Baby, Feminine & Family Care: In baby care, we are the global market leader and compete mainly in taped diapers, pants and baby wipes with nearly 25% global market share. We have the number one or number two market share position in most of the key markets in which we compete, primarily behind Pampers, the Company's largest brand, with annual net sales of over $7 billion. We are the global market leader in the feminine care category with 25% global market share, primarily behind our Always and Tampax brands. We also compete in the adult incontinence category in certain markets behind Always Discreet, achieving nearly 10% market share in most of the key markets in which we compete. Our family care business is predominantly a North American business comprised primarily of the Bounty paper towel and Charmin toilet paper brands. U.S. market shares are over 40% for Bounty and over 25% for Charmin.Enterprise MarketsAs a result of the changes in our organization design effective July 1, 2019, EMs are responsible for sales and profit delivery in specific countries, supported by SBU agreed innovation and supply chain plans, along with scaled services like planning, distribution and customer management.Corporate FunctionsCF provides company-level strategy and portfolio analysis, corporate accounting, treasury, tax, external relations, governance, human resources and legal services.The Procter & Gamble Company 15Global Business ServicesGBS provides technology, processes and standard data tools to enable the SBUs, the EMs and CF to better understand the business and better serve consumers and customers. The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class solutions at a low cost and with minimal capital investment.STRATEGIC FOCUSProcter & Gamble aspires to serve the world’s consumers better than our best competitors in every category and in every country in which we compete, and, as a result, deliver total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. Delivering and sustaining leadership levels of shareholder value creation requires balanced top- and bottom-line growth and strong cash generation.The Company has undertaken an effort to focus and strengthen its business portfolio to compete in categories and with brands that are structurally attractive and that play to P&G's strengths. The ongoing portfolio of businesses consists of ten product categories where P&G has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies.Within these categories, our strategic choices are focused on winning with consumers. The consumers who purchase and use our products are at the center of everything we do. We win with consumers by delivering superiority across the five key elements of product, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value equation. Winning with consumers around the world and against our best competitors requires innovation. Innovation has always been, and continues to be, P&G’s lifeblood. Innovation requires consumer insights and technology advancements that lead to product improvements, improved marketing and merchandising programs and game-changing inventions that create new brands and categories.Productivity improvement is critical to delivering our balanced top- and bottom-line growth and value creation objectives. Productivity improvement and sales growth reinforce and fuel each other. Our objective is to drive productivity improvement across all elements of cost, including cost of goods sold, marketing and promotional spending and non-manufacturing overhead. We plan to reinvest productivity improvements and cost savings in product and packaging improvements, brand awareness-building advertising and trial-building sampling programs, increased sales coverage and R&D programs as well as to offset cost increases (including commodity and foreign exchange impacts) and improve operating margins.We are constructively disrupting our industry and the way we do business, including how we innovate, communicate and leverage new technologies, to create more value.We are improving operational effectiveness and organizational culture through enhanced clarity of roles and responsibilities, accountability and incentive compensation programs.We believe these strategies are right for the long-term health of the Company and our objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group.The Company expects the delivery of the following long-term annual financial targets will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive fast-moving consumer goods peer group:•Organic sales growth above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete;•Core earnings per share (EPS) growth of mid-to-high single digits; and•Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater.In periods with significant macroeconomic pressures, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, we intend to maintain a disciplined approach to investing so as not to sacrifice the long-term health of our businesses to meet short-term objectives in any given year.

Foreign exchange had a negative 2% impact on net sales. Net sales growth was driven by a double digit increase in Health Care, a high single digit increase in Fabric & Home Care, a mid-single digit increase in Beauty and a low single digit increase in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Grooming net sales decreased low single digits. Organic sales increased 6% on a 4% increase in organic volume. Organic sales increased high single digits in Health Care and in Fabric & Home Care, increased mid-single digits in Beauty and in Baby, Feminine & Family Care and increased low single digits in Grooming.16 The Procter & Gamble Company•Operating income increased $10.2 billion, or 186% versus year ago, due primarily to the $8.3 billion base period non-cash impairment charges related to Shave Care goodwill and Gillette indefinite-lived intangible assets (Shave Care impairment). The remaining $1.9 billion increase was driven by the net sales increase and an increase in operating margin.•Net earnings increased $9.1 billion or 230% versus year ago, due to the aforementioned items and a reduction in current year effective tax rates, partially offset by the base period gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership and other minor divestitures. Foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings by approximately $390 million. •Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $13.0 billion, an increase of $9.1 billion or 234% versus the prior year primarily due to the aforementioned items.•Diluted net earnings per share (EPS) increased 247% to $4.96.◦ Core EPS increased 13% to $5.12.•Cash flow from operating activities was $17.4 billion.◦ Adjusted free cash flow was $14.9 billion.◦ Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 114%.ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIESWe discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are ""forward-looking statements"" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors, except as required by law. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.Global Economic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macro-economic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Current global economic conditions are highly volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in both market size contractions in certain countries due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement, as well as market size increases in certain countries due to pantry loading and increased consumption of household cleaning and personal health and hygiene products by consumers. Other macro-economic factors also remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-dependent economies, greater political unrest or instability in the Middle East, Central & Eastern Europe, certain Latin American markets, the Hong Kong market in Greater China and the Korean peninsula and economic uncertainty related to the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our net earnings and cash flows.Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic may also impact our costs. If we are unable to manage these impacts through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. As discussed later in the MD&A, in 2012 we initiated overhead and supply chain cost improvement projects. In fiscal 2017, we communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year cost reduction program which is resulting in targeted enrollment reductions and other savings. If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.Foreign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In four of the past five years, including fiscal 2020, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies, leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Brazil, Greater China, Turkey and the United Kingdom have had, and could continue to have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and net earnings. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.The Procter & Gamble Company 17Government Policies. Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies, for example, the U.S. Tax Act, and the current work being led by the OECD for the G20 focused on ""Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy."" The breadth of this project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to impact all multinational businesses by redefining jurisdictional taxation rights. Further, our sales, net earnings and cash flows may be impacted by U.S. and foreign government policies to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, such as movement restrictions or site closures. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt, Argentina and Turkey. Further, our sales, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere, including increases of import tariffs, both currently effective and future potential changes. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.COVID-19 Pandemic disclosuresThe Company’s priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic are protecting the health and safety of our employees; maximizing the availability of products that help consumers with their health, hygiene and cleaning needs; and using our employees’ talents and our resources to help society meet and overcome the current challenges. Because the Company sells products that are essential to the daily lives of consumers, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material net impact to our consolidated sales, net earnings and cash flows in the current year. However, the pandemic has had offsetting impacts during the period. For example, during the second half of fiscal 2020 we experienced a significant increase in demand and consumption of certain of our product categories (health, hygiene and home cleaning products) primarily in North America, caused in part by changing consumer habits and pantry stocking, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to increases in sales, net earnings and cash flows. At the same time, we experienced a decrease in sales due to the economic slowdown and restricted consumer movements in certain regions, including Europe, IMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America, in certain channels, including travel retail, professional and electronics stores, and in certain of our beauty and grooming products. While we experienced a decrease in sales in Greater China during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, demand recovered in the fourth quarter as restrictions on consumer movement were relaxed. In the future, the pandemic may cause reduced demand for our products if it results in a recessionary global economic environment. Demand in certain of our Enterprise Markets, including certain countries in Latin America, Asia Pacific, and IMEA may be particularly susceptible to recession. It could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products due to government actions impacting our ability to produce and ship products or impacting consumers’ movements and access to our products. We believe that over the long term, there will continue to be strong demand for categories in which we operate, particularly our products that deliver essential health, hygiene and cleaning benefits. However, the timing and extent of demand recovery in markets such as Greater China and Japan, the resumption of international travel, the timing and impact of potential consumer pantry destocking in markets including North America and Europe, and product demand volatility caused by future economic trends are unclear. Accordingly, there may be heightened volatility in sales, net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to the duration of the pandemic. Our retail customers are also being impacted by the pandemic. Their success in addressing the issues and maintaining their operations could impact consumer access to, and as a result, sales of our products.Our ability to continue to operate without any significant negative impacts will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain. The Company has endeavored to follow actions recommended by governments and health authorities to protect our employees world-wide, with particular measures in place for those working in our plants and distribution facilities. We have also worked closely with local and national officials to keep our manufacturing facilities open due to the essential nature of the majority our products. We were able to broadly maintain our operations in the current fiscal year, but we have experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain Enterprise Markets due primarily to the restriction of employee movements as well as increased transportation and manufacturing costs. We intend to continue to work with government authorities and implement our employee safety measures to ensure that we are able to continue manufacturing and distributing our products during the pandemic. However, uncertainty resulting from the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain (for example a closure of a key manufacturing or distribution facility or the inability of a key material or transportation supplier to source and transport materials) that could impact our operations. Because the pandemic has not had a material negative impact on our operations or demand for our products and resulting sales and net earnings, it has also not negatively impacted the Company’s liquidity position. We continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our short-term liquidity needs, and we expect to maintain access to the capital markets enabled by our strong short- and long-term credit ratings. We have also not observed any material impairments of our assets or a significant change in the fair value of assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.18 The Procter & Gamble CompanyRESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe key metrics included in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative costs (SG&A), other non-operating items and income taxes. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of initiatives, pricing and other activities by competitors), marketing spending, retail executions (both in-store and online), and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as our pricing actions (which can also impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the U.S.Most of our cost of products sold and SG&A are to some extent variable in nature. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in North America are generally higher than the Company average for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for example, product or package improvements) and to a lesser extent scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary components of SG&A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. While overhead costs are variable to some extent, we generally experience more scale-related impactsfor these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems' infrastructures to support business growth.For a detailed discussion of the fiscal 2019 year over year changes, please refer to the MD&A in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.Net SalesNet sales increased 5% to $71.0 billion in fiscal 2020 on a 4% increase in unit volume versus the prior year. Volume increased double digits in Health Care, increased mid-single digits in Fabric & Home Care and increased low single digits in Beauty and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Volume decreased low single digits in Grooming. Excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, including the Merck OTC acquisition, organic volume increased mid-single digits in Health Care and increased high single digits in Fabric & Home Care.On a regional basis, volume increased high single digits in North America and increased low single digits in Greater China, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America driven by innovation, market growth and increased demand, particularly in household cleaning and personal health and hygiene products in the second half of the fiscal year, driven in part by increased consumption and pantry loading due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Volume decreased low single digits in IMEA as growth in the first half of the year was more than offset by market contraction in the second half of the fiscal year driven by economic slowdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sales by 2%. Increased pricing had a positive 1% impact on net sales. Mix had a positive 1% impact on net sales driven by the disproportionate organic growth of the Personal Health Care and Home Care categories and the North America region, all of which have higher than company average selling prices. Organic sales grew 6% on a 4% increase in organic volume. Operating CostsComparisons as a percentage of net sales; Years ended June 3020202019Basis Point ChangeGross margin50.3 %48.6 %170 Selling, general and administrative expense28.2 %28.2 %— Operating margin22.1 %8.1 %1,400 Earnings before income taxes22.3 %9.0 %1,330 Net earnings18.5 %5.9 %1,260 Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble18.4 %5.8 %1,260 Gross margin increased 170 basis points to 50.3% of net sales in fiscal 2020. Gross margin benefited from:•150 basis points from total manufacturing cost savings (130 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments), •90 basis points from lower commodity costs and •60 basis points of positive pricing impacts. These were offset by a 70 basis-point decline from unfavorable product mix (due to the disproportionate organic The Procter & Gamble Company 19growth of the Fabric & Home Care segment which has lower than company average gross margin and mix within segments due to the growth of lower margin product forms and larger sizes in certain categories), a 20 basis-point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange and 20 basis points of other impacts.Total SG&A increased 5% to $20.0 billion, primarily due to increases in marketing spending and, to a lesser extent, increases in other net operating expenses and overhead costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was unchanged at 28.2%. An increase in marketing spending and other net operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was offset by a decrease in overhead costs as a percentage of net sales.•Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points due to investments in media and other marketing spending, partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and savings in agency compensation, production costs and advertising spending.•Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings, partially offset by inflation and other cost increases.•Other net operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased approximately 30 basis points primarily due to the base period gain on sale of real estate.Operating margin increased 1,400 basis points to 22.1% for fiscal 2020. 1,230 basis points of this increase is due to the Shave Care impairment charge in the base period. The remaining increase is due to the increase in gross margin as discussed above.Non-Operating Items•Interest expense was $465 million in fiscal 2020, a decrease of $44 million versus the prior year due primarily to a reduction in U.S. interest rates, partially offset by an increase in debt.•Interest income was $155 million in fiscal 2020, a reduction of $65 million versus the prior year due to a reduction in average cash and investment securities balances and a reduction in U.S. interest rates.•Other non-operating income, which consists primarily of divestiture gains and other non-operating items decreased $433 million to $438 million, primarily due to the base period gains from brand divestitures including a $355 million before-tax gain from the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership. Income TaxesIncome taxes increased $628 million to $2.7 billion due to increased earnings, partially offset by a decline in the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate decreased 1,750 basis points to 17.2% in 2020 due to:•a 1,750 basis-point reduction due to the prior year impact of the Shave Care impairment charge as there was no tax benefit related to the goodwill portion of the charge and•a 135 basis-point current year reduction from a tax benefit arising from transactions to simplify our legal entity structure. These reductions were partially offset by:•a 60 basis-point increase from unfavorable impacts from geographic mix of current year earnings, caused primarily by disproportionately higher sales and earnings in the U.S., •a 40 basis-point increase related to the prior year tax impact of the gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership,•a 30 basis-point increase from current year unfavorable discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (15 basis-point increase in the current year rate versus a 15 basis-point decrease in the prior year rate) and•a 5 basis-point increase from lower excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (155 basis-point reduction in the current year versus 160 basis-point reduction in the prior year).Net EarningsOperating income increased 186% or $10.2 billion to $15.7 billion. $8.3 billion of the increase was due to the base period charge for the Shave Care impairment. The remaining $1.9 billion increase was due to the net sales increase and the increase in gross margin partially offset by the increase in SG&A, all of which are discussed above. Earnings before income taxes increased 161% or $9.8 billion to $15.8 billion, as the increase in operating income discussed above was partially offset by the base period gains from the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership and other minor brand divestitures. Net earnings increased 230% or $9.1 billion to $13.1 billion due to the increase in operating income and the reduction in effective income taxes rates discussed above. Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $390 million in fiscal 2020 due to weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar, including those in Argentina, Brazil, China, Turkey and the United Kingdom. This impact includes both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $9.1 billion, or 234%, to $13.0 billion. Diluted net EPS increased $3.53, or 247%, to $4.96 due primarily to the increase in net earnings.Core EPS increased 13% to $5.12. Core EPS represents diluted net EPS from continuing operations, excluding the base year charge for the Shave Care impairment, the base year gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership and incremental restructuring charges in both years related to our productivity and cost savings plans. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in net sales and the increase in operating margin discussed previously.20 The Procter & Gamble CompanySEGMENT RESULTSSegment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation.

Global market share of the hair care category was unchanged.•Volume in Skin and Personal Care increased mid-single digits. Volume increased double digits in Greater China, increased mid-single digits in North America, and increased low single digits in Europe and Asia Pacific due to premium innovation, increased marketing spending and market growth, partially offset by a volume decrease in the SK-II brand and a mid-single digits decline in IMEA due to the COVID-19 pandemic related travel restrictions. Global market share of the skin and personal care category increased nearly half a point.Net earnings increased 4% to $2.7 billion in fiscal 2020 due to the increase in net sales and a 10 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin and an increase in the effective tax rate. The gross margin decrease was mainly driven by the negative impacts of unfavorable mix (due to the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand, driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the disproportionate growth of large sizes) and other hurts related to new manufacturing startup costs partially offset by increased selling prices. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and a reduction in marketing spending due to productivity savings. The increase in the effective tax rate was driven by the unfavorable geographic mix of earnings.GROOMING($ millions)20202019Change vs. 2019VolumeN/AN/A(1)%Net sales$6,069$6,199(2)%Net earnings$1,329$1,529(13)%% of net sales21.9%24.7%(280) bpsThe Procter & Gamble Company 21Grooming net sales decreased 2% to $6.1 billion in fiscal 2020 on a 1% decrease in unit volume.

Volume decreased mid-single digits in IMEA and decreased low single digits in North America and Europe due to market decline and reduced shaving incidents resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and competitive activity. This was partially offset by a mid-single digit volume increase in Asia Pacific due to innovation. Global market share of the shave care category was unchanged.•Appliances volume increased low single digits. Volume increased mid-teens in North America and mid-single digits in Europe due to innovation and increased consumption of at-home styling products due to pandemic related movement restrictions. Volume decreased double digits in Asia Pacific, decreased high single digits in Greater China and decreased low single digits in IMEA due to market contraction, competitive activity and the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Global market share of the appliances category increased more than a point.Net earnings decreased 13% to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2020 due to the decrease in net sales and a 280 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin decreased due to an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, an increase in the effective tax rate and a decrease in gross margin. Gross margin decreased due to the negative impact of unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of disposable razors, styling appliances and the Asia Pacific region all of which have lower than segment average margins) partially offset by the positive impacts of manufacturing cost savings and increased selling prices. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to a base period gain on the sale of operating real estate partially offset by current period reductions in overhead costs and marketing spending due to productivity savings. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a base period benefit from the favorable adjustments to reserves for uncertain tax positions.HEALTH CARE($ millions)20202019Change vs. 2019VolumeN/AN/A10%Net sales$9,028$8,21810%Net earnings$1,652$1,5199%% of net sales18.3%18.5%(20) bpsHealth Care net sales increased 10% to $9.0 billion in fiscal 2020 on a 10% increase in unit volume.

Volume growth was led by a double digit increase in Asia Pacific due to a new launch in the adult incontinence category in Japan, as well as high single digits growth in North America, mid-single digits growth in Europe and low single digits growth in Greater China and Latin America, all due to product innovation, increased marketing spending, adult incontinence category growth and to a lesser extent the increased consumption and pantry loading related to the COVID-19 pandemic in certain markets. Excluding the impact of a minor brand acquisition, volume in North America increased mid-single digits. This was partially offset by a low single digit volume decrease in IMEA due to the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Global market share of the feminine care category increased nearly a point.The Procter & Gamble Company 23•Volume in Family Care, which is predominantly a North American business, increased high single digits driven by the COVID-19 pandemic related market growth, consumption increase and pantry loading, product innovation, increased marketing spending and market growth. In the U.S., all-outlet share of the family care category decreased more than half a point.Net earnings in fiscal 2020 increased 27% to $3.5 billion due to the increase in net sales and a 350 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased primarily due to an increase in gross margin, partially offset by an increase in the effective tax rate and a marginal increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin increase was driven by manufacturing cost savings, a reduction in commodity costs and higher selling prices partially offset by unfavorable product mix (due to the disproportionate growth of large sizes and product forms with lower than segment average margins). SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased marginally due primarily to an increase in marketing spending, partially offset by a reduction in overhead costs driven by productivity savings and the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase. The increase in the effective tax rate was driven by an unfavorable geographic mix of earnings.CORPORATE($ millions)20202019Change vs. 2019Net sales$395$484(18)%Net earnings/(loss)$(234)$(7,971)N/ACorporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; certain employee benefit costs; other general corporate items; gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; certain asset impairment charges; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate.Corporate net sales decreased 18% to $395 million in fiscal 2020 due to a decrease in the net sales of the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net loss decreased by $7.7 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the $8.0 billion after tax ($8.3 billion before tax) base period charge for the Shave Care impairment, partially offset by higher base period divestiture gains (primarily driven by gain on the dissolution of the PGT healthcare partnership). Restructuring Program to Deliver Productivity and Cost SavingsIn fiscal 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to both fund the Company's growth strategy and increase the Company's operating margin. In fiscal 2017, the Company communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings program.The current productivity and cost savings plan is further reducing costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. As part of this plan, the Company incurred approximately $1.5 billion in total before- tax restructuring costs across 2019 and 2020. In fiscal 2021 and onwards, the Company expects to incur restructuring costs within the range of our historical ongoing level of $250 to $500 million annually. Savings generated from the Company's restructuring program are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. However, we estimate that through 2020, the underlying restructuring costs incurred since 2012 (approximately $8.2 billion), along with other non-manufacturing enrollment reductions since 2012 have delivered approximately $3.7 billion in annual before-tax gross savings. Restructuring accruals of $472 million as of June 30, 2020 are classified as current liabilities. Approximately 52% of the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2020 either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting.In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins.Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program and to the Operating Costs section of the MD&A for more information about the total benefit to operating margins from our total savings efforts.CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates.Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.24 The Procter & Gamble CompanyOperating Cash FlowOperating cash flow was $17.4 billion in 2020, a 14% increase from the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation and deferred income taxes) generated approximately $16.1 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flow as summarized below.•A decrease in accounts receivable generated $634 million of cash primarily due to the timing of the end of the fiscal year (which fell on a Tuesday versus Sunday in the prior year end, resulting in additional collection days in the current year) and lower relative sales at the end of the period in certain markets driven by COVID-19. The number of days sales outstanding decreased approximately 5 days versus prior year.•Higher inventory used $637 million of cash mainly due to inventory increases to support initiatives, business growth across all segments and to replenish stocks in certain categories depleted by the COVID-19 pandemic related demand increases. Inventory days on hand increased approximately 4 days primarily due to initiative support and inventory replenishment. •Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $1.9 billion of cash. Approximately $700 million of this was driven by extended payment terms with our suppliers (see Extended Payment Terms and Supply Chain Financing below). The remaining amount was driven by higher payables from increased manufacturing activity due to the pandemic related demand increases, an increase in marketing spending in the fourth quarter versus the prior year and increases in taxes payable related to the Merck integration. Days payable outstanding increased approximately 4 days to 81 days as of June 30, 2020 due to the above.•Other net operating assets and liabilities declined, using $710 million of cash, primarily driven by the payment of the current year portion of taxes due related to the U.S. Tax Act repatriation charge ($215 million) and pension related accruals and contributions.Adjusted Free Cash Flow. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important non-GAAP measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act and tax payments related to the Merck acquisition. Adjusted free cash flow is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation. Adjusted free cash flow was $14.9 billion in 2020, an increase of 23% versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in operating cash flows as discussed above. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings, was 114% in 2020. Extended Payment Terms and Supply Chain Financing. Beginning in fiscal 2014, in response to evolving market practices, the Company began a program to negotiate extended payment terms with its suppliers. At about the same time, the Company initiated a Supply Chain Finance program (SCF) with several global financial institutions (SCF Banks). Under the SCF, qualifying suppliers may elect to sell their receivables from the Company to an SCF Bank. These participating suppliers negotiate their receivables sales arrangements directly with the respective SCF Bank. While the Company is not party to those agreements, the SCF Banks allow the participating suppliers to utilize the Company’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs. This generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. The Company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier elects to participate in the SCF and reaches an agreement with an SCF Bank, the supplier elects which individual Company invoices they sell to the SCF bank. However, all the Company’s payments to participating suppliers are paid to the SCF Bank on the invoice due date, regardless of whether the individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the SCF Bank. The SCF Bank pays the supplier on the invoice due date for any invoices that were not previously sold by the supplier to the SCF Bank.The terms of the Company’s payment obligation are not impacted by a supplier’s participation in the SCF. Our payment terms with our suppliers for similar materials within individual markets are consistent between suppliers that elect to participate in the SCF and those that do not participate. Accordingly, our average days outstanding are not significantly impacted by the portion of suppliers or related input costs that are included in the SCF. In addition, the SCF is available to both material suppliers, where the underlying costs are largely included in Cost of goods sold, and to service suppliers, where the underlying costs are largely included in SG&A. As of June 30, 2020, approximately 3% of our global suppliers have elected to participate in the SCF. Payments to those suppliers during 2020 total approximately $13 billion, which equals approximately 24% of our total Cost of goods sold and SG&A for the period. For participating suppliers, we believe substantially all of their receivables with the Company are sold to the SCF Banks. Accordingly, we would expect that at each balance sheet date, a similar proportion of amounts originally due to suppliers would instead be payable to SCF Banks. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in the SCF are recorded within Accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of both June 30, 2020 and 2019, the amount due to suppliers participating in the SCF and included in Accounts payable were approximately $4 billion.Although difficult to project due to market and other dynamics, we anticipate incremental cash flow benefits from the extended payment terms with suppliers could increase at The Procter & Gamble Company 25a slower rate in fiscal 2021. Future changes in our suppliers’ financing policies or economic developments, such as changes in interest rates, general market liquidity or the Company’s creditworthiness relative to participating suppliers could impact suppliers’ participation in the SCF and/or our ability to negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers. However, any such impacts are difficult to predict.Investing Cash FlowNet investing activities generated $3.0 billion in cash in 2020, mainly due to proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities, partially offset by capital spending. Net investing activities consumed $3.5 billion in cash in 2019, mainly due to capital spending and business acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments. Capital Spending. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost efficiencies, were $3.1 billion in 2020 and $3.3 billion in 2019. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 60 basis points to 4.3% in 2020. Acquisitions. Acquisition activity used cash of $58 million in 2020, primarily related to final contractual payments from the prior year acquisition of Merck OTC along with a minor Baby Care acquisition. Acquisition activity used $3.9 billion in 2019, primarily related to the Merck OTC acquisition. Proceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales were $30 million and $394 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, primarily from minor brand divestitures in both years and the sale of real estate in 2019. Investment Securities. Investments generated net cash of $6.2 billion in 2020 and $3.5 billion in 2019 primarily from sales and maturities of investment securities. Financing Cash FlowNet financing activities consumed $8.4 billion of cash in 2020, mainly due to dividends to shareholders and treasury stock purchases, partially offset by a net increase in debt and the impact of stock options. Net financing activities consumed $10.0 billion in cash in 2019, mainly due to dividends to shareholders and treasury stock purchases, partially offset by the impact of stock options. Dividend Payments. Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments. Dividends per common share increased 5% to $3.0284 per share in 2020. Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $7.8 billion in 2020 and $7.5 billion in 2019. In April 2020, the Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.7459 to $0.7907 per share on Common Stock and Series A and B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock. This represents a 6% increase compared to the prior quarterly dividend and is the 64th consecutive year that our dividend has increased. We have paid a dividend for 130 consecutive years, every year since our incorporation in 1890.Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $34.7 billion as of June 30, 2020 and $30.1 billion as of June 30, 2019. The increase is primarily due to the issuance of bonds generating $5.0 billion of cash.Treasury Purchases. Total share repurchases were $7.4 billion in 2020 and $5.0 billion in 2019. LiquidityAt June 30, 2020, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $5.0 billion largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. As of June 30, 2020, the Company did not have material net cash and cash equivalents related to foreign subsidiaries nor related to any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds. Under current law, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future. We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled, and should continue to enable, us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient funding to meet short-term financing requirements.On June 30, 2020, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard & Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings were Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard & Poor's), all with a stable outlook.We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $8.0 billion facility split between a $3.2 billion five-year facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire in November 2024 and November 2020, respectively. Both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities. For additional details on debt see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.26 The Procter & Gamble CompanyGuarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity. Contractual CommitmentsThe following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2020.($ millions)TotalLess Than 1 Year1-3 Years3-5 YearsAfter 5 YearsRECORDED LIABILITIESTotal debt$34,589 $11,189 $5,154 $5,148 $13,098 Leases1,023 239 352 220 212 U.S. Tax Act transitional charge (1)2,346 224 450 984 688 Uncertain tax positions (2)59 59 — — — OTHERInterest payments relating to long-term debt6,676 673 1,173 955 3,875 Minimum pension funding (3)603 196 407 — — Purchase obligations (4)1,577 782 412 145 238 TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS$46,873 $13,362 $7,948 $7,452 $18,111 (1)Represents the U.S. federal tax liability associated with the repatriation provisions of the U.S. Tax Act. Does not include any provisions made for foreign withholding taxes on expected repatriations as the timing of those payments is uncertain.(2)As of June 30, 2020, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $643 million, including $158 million of interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of June 30, 2020 cannot be made.(3)Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2023 are not currently determinable.(4)Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent minimum commitments under take-or-pay agreements with suppliers and are in line with expected usage. This includes service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include revenue recognition, income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.The Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.Revenue RecognitionOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, in-store merchandising funds, advertising and other promotional activities, and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale. Amounts accrued for trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation, based on contractual terms, sales volumes and historical utilization and redemption rates. The actual amounts paid may be different from such estimates. These differences, which have historically not been significant, are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” on July 1, 2018. Adoption of this standard resulted in a change The Procter & Gamble Company 27in the timing of recognition of certain trade promotional spending. Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, and our ability to uphold certain tax positions.Realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.A core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model, such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities. However, because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts, we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various cross-border transactions. We have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty. We estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70% of our global earnings. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the Company's income taxes.Employee BenefitsWe sponsor various post-employment benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans require assumptions to estimate the net projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and net obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPEB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2020, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPEB assets was 6.6% and 8.4%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPEB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit/expense by approximately $130 million.Since pension and OPEB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPEB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans of 1.5% represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $220 million. The average discount rate on the OPEB plan of 3.1% reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the U.S., which is where a majority of the plan participants receive benefits. A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax OPEB expense by approximately $50 million. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for 28 The Procter & Gamble Companyadditional details on our defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsSignificant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations. We typically estimate the fair value of these assets using the income method, which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. The valuations used to establish and to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin progression, Company business plans and the discount rate applied to cash flows.Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized, but are tested at least annually for impairment. Our ongoing annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the 3 months ended December 31. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. For example, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. In addition, changes to, or a failure to achieve business plans or deterioration of macroeconomic conditions could result in reduced cash flows or higher discount rates, leading to a lower valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses.We test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the book value of each asset to the estimated fair value. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. The test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two-step process. In the first step (step one), we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a second step (step two) to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. The second step of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting unit's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination. The difference between the step one fair value and the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities in step two is the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If this implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment.Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, all customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. An impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high. The Appliances wholly-acquired reporting unit has a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value. During fiscal 2019, a non-cash before- and after-tax impairment charge of $6.8 billion was recognized to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill for the Shave Care reporting unit, and a non-cash, before-tax impairment charge of $1.6 billion ($1.2 billion after-tax) was recognized to reduce the carrying amount of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to its fair value. The underlying reductions in fair values were due in large part to significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar, a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits, primarily in the developed markets, and an increased competitive market environment in the U.S. and certain other markets. As a result of the fiscal 2019 impairment determined by the step two testing, the Shave Care fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 20% as of June 30, 2019. Because the impairment testing for intangible assets is a one-step process, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value approximated its carrying value at that date. During our annual impairment testing during the quarter ended December 31, 2019, we reduced the discount rate used in the valuation based on developments in the macroeconomic environment. As a result of this change and updates to other underlying cash flow projections, the Shave Care fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 20% and the The Procter & Gamble Company 29Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 5%. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates (including residual growth rates) and discount rate. The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans and approximates expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate is dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S.While management can and has implemented strategies to address these events, changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the Shave Care reporting unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. As of June 30, 2020, the carrying values of the Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were $12.5 billion and $14.1 billion, respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic that occurred during the second half of fiscal 2020 resulted in a reduction in shave incidents by consumers and a weakening of certain currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which led to a reduction in net sales for Gillette-branded products. This resulted in a triggering event for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset, which caused us to perform an additional impairment assessment for that asset as of June 30, 2020. That assessment indicated that the fair value of the Gillette trade name approximated its carrying value. Accordingly, no impairment charge was recorded during the year ended June 30, 2020. The duration and severity of the pandemic could result in additional future impairment charges for the Shave Care reporting unit goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. Our June 30, 2020 impairment assessment of the Gillette intangible asset assumes the pandemic’s impact on net sales will begin to abate during the first half of fiscal 2021 and be largely eliminated by the second half of the fiscal year. There is an extreme level of uncertainty relating to how the pandemic will evolve and how governments and consumers will react. Accordingly, there is a significant amount of uncertainty related to this key assumption. A more prolonged pandemic could impact the results of operations due to changes to assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset that are significant enough to trigger an impairment. Net sales and earnings growth rates could be negatively impacted by more prolonged reductions or changes in demand for our shave care products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, financial hardship, changes in the use and frequency of grooming products or by shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries’ currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Finally, the discount rate utilized in our valuation model could be impacted by changes in the underlying interest rates and risk premiums included in the determination of the cost of capital. The table below provides a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorter term and residual growth rates and the discount rate, to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis point increase to discount rate or a 25 basis point decrease to our shorter-term and residual growth rates, either of which, in isolation, would result in an additional impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.

We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. We leverage the Company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility within our financing operations, as discussed below, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments.Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the RiskManager™ value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics™ dataset as of June 30, 2020. In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics™, a reasonable proxy is included.Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term.Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments.Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June 30, 2020, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements.Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps with maturities of less than 18 months. Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2020, we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact on such instruments of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements.Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures.As of and during the years ended June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, we did not have any commodity hedging activity. Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAPIn accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business trends (i.e. trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. These measures include:Organic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Procter & Gamble Company 31The following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth:Year ended June 30, 2020Net Sales GrowthForeign Exchange ImpactAcquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other (1)Organic Sales GrowthBeauty4 %2 %(1)%5 %Grooming(2)%3 %— %1 %Health Care10 %2 %(5)%7 %Fabric & Home Care7 %1 %1 %9 %Baby, Feminine & Family Care3 %2 %(1)%4 %TOTAL COMPANY5 %2 %(1)%6 %(1) Acquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other includes the volume and mix impact of acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales.Adjusted Free Cash Flow. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending, tax payments related to the Merck OTC Consumer Healthcare acquisition in 2020 and the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act in 2020 and 2019 (the Company incurred a transitional tax liability of approximately $3.8 billion from the U.S. Tax Act, which is payable over a period of 8 years). Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available fordividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow ($ millions):OperatingCash FlowCapitalSpendingAdjustments to Operating Cash Flow (1)Adjusted FreeCash Flow2020$17,403 $(3,073) $543 $14,873 2019$15,242 $(3,347) $235 $12,130 (1) Adjustments to Operating Cash Flow include tax payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act of $215 and $235 in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and tax payments related to the Merck acquisition of $328 in 2020.Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent.The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow productivity ($ millions):Adjusted Free Cash FlowNetEarningsAdjusted FreeCash FlowProductivity2020$14,873 $13,103 114 % Core EPS. Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. Core EPS is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The table below provides a reconciliation of diluted net earnings per share to Core EPS, including the following reconciling items:•Incremental Restructuring: The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. In 2012, the Company began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that included incremental restructuring activities. In 2017, we communicated details of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings plan. This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. •Gain on Dissolution of the PGT Healthcare Partnership: The Company dissolved our PGT Healthcare partnership, a venture between the Company and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries, Ltd (Teva) in the OTC consumer healthcare business, during the year ended June 30, 2019. The transaction was accounted for as a sale of the Teva portion of the PGT business and the Company recognized an after-tax gain on the dissolution of $353 million. •Shave Care Impairment: As discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in the Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates section of the MD&A, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company recognized a non-cash after-tax charge of $8.0 billion ($8.3 billion before tax) to adjust the carrying values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. This was comprised of a before and after-tax impairment charge of $6.8 billion related to goodwill and an after-tax impairment charge of $1.2 billion ($1.6 billion before tax) to reduce the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. •Anti-Dilutive Impacts: As discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Shave Care impairment charges caused preferred shares that are normally dilutive (and hence, normally assumed converted for purposes of determining diluted earnings per share) to be anti-dilutive. Accordingly, for U.S. GAAP the preferred shares were not assumed to be converted into common shares for diluted earnings per share and the related dividends paid to the preferred 32 The Procter & Gamble Companyshareholders were deducted from net income to calculate net earnings available to common shareholders. As a result of the non-GAAP Shave Care impairment adjustment, these instruments are dilutive for non-GAAP core EPS. We do not view the above items to be indicative of underlying business results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES(Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Reconciliation of Non-GAAP MeasuresTwelve Months Ended June 30, 2020AS REPORTED (GAAP)INCREMENTAL RESTRUCTURINGNON-GAAP (CORE)NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO P&G13,027 415 13,442 Core EPSDILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (1)$4.96 $0.16 $5.12 (1) Diluted net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble.

Accordingly, for U.S. GAAP, the preferred shares were not assumed to be converted into common shares for diluted earnings per share and the related dividends paid to the preferred shareholders were deducted from net income to calculate earnings available to common shareholders. Excluding the impairment charge results in higher non-GAAP earnings which causes the preferred shares to be dilutive. The adjustments in this row are made to reflect the dilutive preferred share impact resulting from the Shave Care impairment adjustment.Item 7A.

A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein, is included in the section titled ""Economic Conditions and Uncertainties"" and the section titled ""Risk Factors"" (Part I, Item 1A) of this Form 10-K.The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections:•Overview•Summary of 2021 Results The Procter & Gamble Company 13•Economic Conditions and Uncertainties•Results of Operations•Segment Results•Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity•Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates•Other InformationThroughout the MD&A we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per share and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), consisting of organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending, transitional tax payments related to the U.S. Tax Act and tax payments related to the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding certain one-time items. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends, as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis, relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures quarter and fiscal-year-to-date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. OVERVIEWProcter & Gamble is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products, as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.14 The Procter & Gamble CompanyOrganizational StructureOur organizational structure is comprised of Sector Business Units (SBUs), Enterprise Markets (EMs), Corporate Functions (CF) and Global Business Services (GBS).Sector Business UnitsThe Company's ten product categories are organized into six SBUs. The SBUs are responsible for global brand strategy, new product upgrades and innovation, marketing plans and supply chain. They have direct profit responsibility for markets representing the large majority of the Company's sales and earnings (referred to as Focus Markets) and are responsible for innovation plans, supply plans and operating frameworks to drive growth and value creation in the remaining markets (referred to as Enterprise Markets). Effective September 2021, the Company will be organized into five SBUs as Baby and Feminine Care will combine with Family Care into one SBU to leverage organizational and business synergies. Under U.S. GAAP, the categories underlying the SBUs are, and will continue to be, aggregated into five reportable segments: Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric & Home Care; and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Throughout the MD&A, we reference business results by region, which are comprised of North America, Europe, Greater China, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA). The following provides additional detail on our reportable segments and the ten product categories and brand composition within each segment.Reportable Segments% ofNet Sales (1)% of NetEarnings (1)Product Categories (Sub-Categories)Major BrandsBeauty19%22%Hair Care (Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments)Head & Shoulders, Herbal Essences, Pantene, RejoiceSkin and Personal Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care)Olay, Old Spice, Safeguard, Secret, SK-IIGrooming9%10%Grooming (2) (Shave Care - Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care; Appliances)Braun, Gillette, VenusHealth Care13%12%Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care)Crest, Oral-BPersonal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Pain Relief, Other Personal Health Care)Metamucil, Neurobion, Pepto-Bismol, VicksFabric & Home Care34%31%Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents)Ariel, Downy, Gain, TideHome Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care)Cascade, Dawn, Fairy, Febreze, Mr. Clean, SwifferBaby, Feminine & Family Care25%25%Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants)Luvs, PampersFeminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care)Always, Always Discreet, TampaxFamily Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper)Bounty, Charmin, Puffs (1) Percent of Net sales and Net earnings for the year ended June 30, 2021 (excluding results held in Corporate).(2) The Grooming product category is comprised of the Shave Care and Appliances operating segments. Recent Developments: During fiscal 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of the over-the-counter (OTC) healthcare business of Merck KGaA (Merck OTC) for approximately $3.7 billion. This business primarily sells OTC consumer healthcare products, mainly in markets in Europe, Latin America and Asia and is included within our personal health care category.During fiscal 2019, the Company also dissolved our PGT Healthcare partnership, a venture between the Company and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd (Teva) in the OTC consumer healthcare business. Pursuant to the agreement, PGT product assets were returned to the original respective parent companies to reestablish independent OTC businesses. This transaction was accounted for as a sale of the Teva portion of the PGT business. The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the sale of $353 million.Organization Design:Sector Business UnitsBeauty: We are a global market leader amongst the beauty categories in which we compete, including hair care and skin and personal care. We are the global market leader in the retail hair care market with over 20% global market share primarily behind our Pantene and Head & Shoulders brands. In skin and personal care, we offer a wide variety of products, ranging from deodorants to personal cleansing to skin care, such as our Olay brand, which is one of the top facial skin care brands in the world with approximately 6% global market share. Grooming: We compete in shave care and appliances. In shave care, we are the global market leader in the blades and The Procter & Gamble Company 15razors market. Our global blades and razors market share is over 60%, primarily behind our Gillette and Venus brands. Our appliances, such as electric shavers and epilators, are sold primarily under the Braun brand in a number of markets around the world where we compete against both global and regional competitors. We hold over 25% of the male electric shavers market and over 50% of the female epilators market.Health Care: We compete in oral care and personal health care. In oral care, there are several global competitors in the market and we have the number two market share position with nearly 20% global market share behind our Crest and Oral-B brands. In personal health care, we are a top ten competitor in a large, highly fragmented industry, primarily behind respiratory treatments (Vicks brand) and digestive wellness products (Metamucil and Pepto Bismol brands). As discussed earlier, in fiscal 2019, we dissolved the PGT Healthcare partnership with Teva, and reestablished an independent OTC business. We also acquired Merck OTC as discussed above. Fabric & Home Care: This segment is comprised of a variety of fabric care products, including laundry detergents, additives and fabric enhancers; and home care products, including dishwashing liquids and detergents, surface cleaners and air fresheners. In fabric care, we generally have the number one or number two market share position in the markets in which we compete and are the global market leader with over 25% global market share, primarily behind our Tide, Ariel and Downy brands. Our global home care market share is nearly 25% across the categories in which we compete, primarily behind our Cascade, Dawn, Febreze and Swiffer brands.Baby, Feminine & Family Care: In baby care, we are the global market leader and compete mainly in taped diapers, pants and baby wipes with over 20% global market share. We have the number one or number two market share position in most of the key markets in which we compete, primarily behind Pampers, the Company's largest brand, with annual net sales of over $7 billion. We are the global market leader in the feminine care category with 25% global market share, primarily behind our Always and Tampax brands. We also compete in the adult incontinence category in certain markets behind Always Discreet, with nearly 10% market share in the key markets in which we compete. Our family care business is predominantly a North American business comprised primarily of the Bounty paper towel and Charmin toilet paper brands. North America market shares are over 40% for Bounty and approximately 25% for Charmin.Enterprise MarketsEnterprise Markets are responsible for sales and profit delivery in specific countries, supported by SBU-agreed innovation and supply chain plans, along with scaled services like planning, distribution and customer management.Corporate FunctionsCorporate Functions provides company-level strategy and portfolio analysis, corporate accounting, treasury, tax, external relations, governance, human resources and legal services.Global Business ServicesGlobal Business Services provides technology, processes and standard data tools to enable the SBUs, the EMs and CF to better understand the business and better serve consumers and customers. The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class solutions at a low cost and with minimal capital investment.Strategic FocusProcter & Gamble aspires to serve the world’s consumers better than our best competitors in every category and in every country in which we compete and, as a result, deliver total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. Delivering and sustaining leadership levels of shareholder value creation requires balanced top- and bottom-line growth and strong cash generation.The Company has undertaken an effort to focus and strengthen its business portfolio to compete in categories and with brands that are structurally attractive and that play to P&G's strengths. Our portfolio of businesses consists of ten product categories where P&G has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies.Within these categories, our strategic choices are focused on winning with consumers. The consumers who purchase and use our products are at the center of everything we do. We win with consumers by delivering superiority across the five key elements of product, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value equation. Winning with consumers around the world and against our best competitors requires innovation. Innovation has always been, and continues to be, P&G’s lifeblood. Innovation requires consumer insights and technology advancements that lead to product improvements, improved marketing and merchandising programs and game-changing inventions that create new brands and categories.Productivity improvement is critical to delivering our balanced top- and bottom-line growth, cash generation and value creation objectives. Productivity improvement and sales growth reinforce and fuel each other. Our objective is to drive productivity improvement across all elements of cost, including cost of goods sold, marketing and promotional spending and overhead costs. We plan to use productivity improvements and cost savings to help offset cost increases (including commodity and foreign exchange impacts), reinvest in product and packaging improvements, brand awareness-building advertising and trial-building sampling programs, increased sales coverage and R&D programs as well as to improve operating margins.We are constructively disrupting our industry and the way we do business, including how we innovate, communicate and leverage new technologies, to create more value.We are improving operational effectiveness and organizational culture through enhanced clarity of roles and 16 The Procter & Gamble Companyresponsibilities, accountability and incentive compensation programs.We believe these strategies are right for the long-term health of the Company and our objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group.The Company expects the delivery of the following long-term annual financial targets will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive, fast-moving consumer goods peer group:•Organic sales growth above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete;•Core earnings per share (EPS) growth of mid-to-high single digits; and•Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater.In periods with significant macroeconomic pressures, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, we intend to maintain a disciplined approach to investing so as not to sacrifice the long-term health of our businesses to meet short-term objectives in any given year.

Favorable foreign exchange had a positive 1% impact on net sales. Net sales growth was driven by double digit increases in Health Care and in Fabric & Home Care, a high single digit increase in Beauty, a mid-single digit increase in Grooming and a low single digit increase in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 6% on a 3% increase in organic volume. Organic sales increased high single digits in Health Care and in Fabric & Home Care, increased mid-single digits in Beauty and in Grooming and increased low single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. •Operating income increased $2.3 billion, or 15% versus year ago to $18.0 billion, driven by the net sales increase and an increase in operating margin.•Net earnings increased $1.2 billion or 10% versus year ago to $14.4 billion, due to the increase in operating income, partially offset by current year charges of $427 million after tax for the early extinguishment of debt and an increase in the current year effective tax rate. Foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings by approximately $108 million. •Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $14.3 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion or 10% versus the prior year primarily due to the increase in net earnings.•Diluted net earnings per share (EPS) increased 11% to $5.50 due to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in shares outstanding.◦ Core EPS, which represents net earnings per share excluding charges for the early extinguishment of debt in the current period and incremental restructuring charges in the base period, increased 11% to $5.66.•Cash flow from operating activities was $18.4 billion.◦ Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures and certain other impacts, was $15.8 billion.◦ Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings, excluding the charges for early debt extinguishment, was 107%.The Procter & Gamble Company 17ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIESWe discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are ""forward-looking statements"" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors, except as required by law. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.Global Economic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Current global economic conditions continue to be highly volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in market size contractions in certain countries due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement. Other macroeconomic factors also remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as greater political unrest or instability in the Middle East, Central & Eastern Europe, certain Latin American markets and the Hong Kong market in Greater China, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our net earnings and cash flows.Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations, including freight container and truck availabilities, due to the COVID-19 pandemic may also impact our costs. If we are unable to manage these impacts through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Net sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on the consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.Foreign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In the past three fiscal years, a number of foreign currencies have weakened versus the U.S. dollar, leading to lower earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. In the current fiscal year, foreign exchange impacts have benefited net sales while negatively impacting earnings due to the mix of currencies in which input costs are denominated. Certain countries currently experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations include Argentina, Brazil, Russia, Turkey as well as the European Union. These fluctuations have significantly impacted our historical net sales, costs and net earnings and could do so in the future. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on the consumption of our products, which would affect our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.Government Policies. Our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies. For example, any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, or any significant change in global tax policy adopted under the current work being led by the OECD for the G20 focused on ""Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy."" The breadth of the OECD project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to impact all multinational businesses by redefining jurisdictional taxation rights. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and climate change matters. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt, Argentina and Turkey. Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere, including any changes related to the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.COVID-19 Pandemic Disclosures. Our net sales, net earnings and cash flows may be impacted by the U.S. and foreign government policies to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, such as movement restrictions or site closures. The Company’s priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be protecting the health and safety of our 18 The Procter & Gamble Companyemployees; maximizing the availability of products that help consumers with their health, hygiene and cleaning needs; and using our employees’ talents and our resources to help society meet and overcome the current challenges. Because the Company sells products that are essential to the daily lives of consumers, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a materially negative impact to our consolidated net sales as positive and negative impacts during fiscal 2021 have largely offset each other. We have experienced a significant increase in demand and consumption of certain of our product categories (fabric, home cleaning and hygiene products) primarily in North America, caused in part by changing consumer habits, pantry stocking and retailer inventory replenishment, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to increases in net sales. At the same time, net sales have been negatively impacted due to the economic slowdown and restricted consumer movements in certain markets in Asia Pacific and Europe, in certain channels, such as professional and in certain categories, such as shave care. In the future, the pandemic may cause reduced demand for our products if it results in a recessionary global economic environment. Demand in certain countries in Latin America, Asia Pacific, and IMEA may be particularly susceptible to recession. It could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products due to government actions impacting our ability to produce and ship products or impacting consumers’ movements and access to our products. The resumption of normal economic activity as we emerge from the pandemic in certain markets, including North America, could also result in reduced demand due to consumption decreases and consumer pantry destocking (particularly, in home cleaning and hygiene products). We believe that over the long term, there will continue to be strong demand for categories in which we operate, particularly our products that deliver essential health, hygiene and cleaning benefits. However, the timing and extent of demand recovery in certain markets in Asia Pacific, IMEA and Latin America, the resumption of international travel, the timing and impact of potential consumer pantry destocking and product demand volatility caused by future economic trends are unclear. Accordingly, there may be heightened volatility in net sales, net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to the duration of the pandemic. Our retail customers are also being impacted by the pandemic. Their success in addressing the issues and maintaining their operations could impact consumer access to and, as a result, sales of our products.Our ability to continue to operate without any significant negative impacts will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain. The Company has endeavored to follow actions recommended by governments and health authorities, including on vaccine administration, to protect our employees worldwide, with particular measures in place for those working in our plants and distribution facilities. We have also worked closely with local and national officials to keep our manufacturing facilities open due to the essential nature of the majority of our products. While we have been able to broadly maintain our operations, we experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain markets in Asia Pacific and IMEA in the first months of the pandemic due primarily to the restriction of employee movements, as well as increased transportation and manufacturing costs. We intend to continue to work with government authorities and implement our employee safety measures to ensure that we continue manufacturing and distributing our products during the pandemic. However, uncertainty resulting from the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain (for example, a closure of a key manufacturing or distribution facility or the inability of a key material or transportation supplier to source and transport materials) that could impact our operations. Because the pandemic has not had a material negative impact on our operations, on the demand for our products or the resulting net sales and net earnings, it has also not negatively impacted the Company’s liquidity position. We continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our short-term liquidity needs, and we continue to maintain access to the capital markets enabled by our strong short- and long-term credit ratings. We have also not observed any material impairments of our assets or a significant change in the fair value of assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe key metrics included in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative costs (SG&A), operating margin, other non-operating items, income taxes and net earnings. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of initiatives, pricing and other activities by competitors), marketing spending, retail executions (both in-store and online), and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as our pricing actions (which can also impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impacts on sales outside the U.S.Most of our cost of products sold and SG&A are to some extent variable in nature. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in North America are generally higher than the Company average for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for example, product or package improvements) and to a lesser The Procter & Gamble Company 19extent scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary components of SG&A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. While overhead costs are variable to some extent, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems' infrastructures to support business growth. The main drivers of changes in SG&A as a percentage of net sales are overhead and marketing cost savings, reinvestments (for example, increased advertising), inflation, foreign exchange fluctuations and scale impacts.For a detailed discussion of the fiscal 2020 year-over-year changes, please refer to the MD&A in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020.Net SalesNet sales increased 7% to $76.1 billion in fiscal 2021 on a 3% increase in unit volume versus the prior year. Favorable foreign exchange increased net sales by 1%. Favorable pricing had a 1% positive impact on net sales. Mix had a positive 2% impact on net sales driven by the disproportionate growth of the North America region, the Health Care segment and the Home Care and Appliances categories, all of which have higher than company-average selling prices. Excluding the net impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, organic sales grew 6% on a 3% increase in organic volume. Net sales increased double digits in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care, increased high single digits in Beauty, increased mid-single digits in Grooming and increased low single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Organic sales grew high single digits in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care.On a regional basis, volume increased high single digits in Greater China, increased mid-single digits in North America and IMEA and increased low single digits in Latin America due to innovation, market growth and increased demand, particularly in household cleaning and personal hygiene products. This was partially driven by increased consumption and retailer inventory restocking due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Volume in Europe was unchanged and decreased low single digits in Asia Pacific due to pandemic-related market contraction. Excluding the impact of a minor brand divestiture, organic volume in Europe increased low single digits. Operating CostsComparisons as a percentage of net sales; Years ended June 3020212020Basis Point ChangeGross margin51.2 %50.3 %90 Selling, general and administrative expense27.6 %28.2 %(60)Operating margin23.6 %22.1 %150 Earnings before income taxes23.1 %22.3 %80 Net earnings18.9 %18.5 %40 Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble18.8 %18.4 %40 Gross margin increased 90 basis points to 51.2% of net sales in fiscal 2021. Gross margin benefited from:•120 basis points from total manufacturing cost savings, net of freight cost increases (100 basis points after including product and packaging reinvestments),•70 basis points of help from lower restructuring costs versus the base period, and•60 basis points of positive pricing impacts. These benefits were offset by an 80 basis-point negative impact from unfavorable product mix (due to the disproportionate growth of the Home Care and Appliances categories which have lower than company-average gross margin and mix within segments due to the growth of lower margin product forms and larger sizes in certain categories), a 40 basis-point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates and a 20 basis-point negative impact from higher commodity costs.Total SG&A increased 5% to $21.0 billion, primarily due to an increase in marketing spending and, to a lesser extent, an increase in overhead costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 60 basis points to 27.6% due to a decrease in overhead costs and other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales. •Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales was unchanged, as investments in media and other marketing spending were offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and savings in agency compensation and production costs.•Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings, partially offset by inflation and other cost increases.•Other net operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points primarily due to a reduction in foreign exchange transactional charges.20 The Procter & Gamble CompanyProductivity-driven cost savings delivered 110 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales.Operating margin increased 150 basis points to 23.6% for fiscal 2021 due to both the increase in gross margin and the decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales as discussed above.Non-Operating Items•Interest expense was $502 million in fiscal 2021, an increase of $37 million versus the prior year due to higher average interest rates for the fiscal year driven by a higher proportion of fixed rate debt.•Interest income was $45 million in fiscal 2021, a reduction of $110 million versus the prior year due to lower U.S. interest rates.•Other non-operating income, which consists primarily of divestiture gains and other non-operating items decreased $352 million to $86 million, primarily due to current period charges of $512 million ($427 million after tax) for the early debt extinguishment. Excluding the debt extinguishment charges, other non-operating income increased $160 million primarily due to an unrealized gain on an equity investment that became publicly traded in fiscal 2021 and an increase in net non-operating benefits on defined benefit retirement plans driven by annual updates to actuarial assumptions. Income TaxesIncome taxes increased to $3.3 billion due to increased earnings and an increase in the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate increased 130 basis points to 18.5% in 2021 due to:•a 135 basis-point increase related to the prior year tax benefit arising from transactions to simplify our legal entity structure, and•a 15 basis-point increase from unfavorable impacts from the geographic mix of current year earnings. These increases are partially offset by:•a 20 basis-point decrease from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (5 basis-point favorable impact in the current year versus a 15 basis-point unfavorable impact in the prior year period).Net EarningsOperating income increased 15%, or $2.3 billion, to $18.0 billion due to the net sales increase and the increase in operating margin, both of which are discussed above. Earnings before income taxes increased 11%, or $1.8 billion, to $17.6 billion, as the increase in operating income was partially offset by the current period charges of $512 million for the early extinguishment of debt. Net earnings increased 10%, or $1.2 billion, to $14.4 billion due to the increase in earnings before income taxes, partially offset by the increase in the effective income tax rate discussed above. Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $108 million in fiscal 2021 due to a weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar. This impact includes both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $1.3 billion, or 10%, to $14.3 billion. Diluted net EPS increased $0.54, or 11%, to $5.50 due primarily to the increase in net earnings and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in shares outstanding.Core EPS increased 11% to $5.66. Core EPS represents diluted net EPS from continuing operations excluding the current year charge for the early debt extinguishment and incremental restructuring charges in the base year related to our productivity and cost savings plans. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in net sales and the increase in operating margin, both of which are discussed above.The Procter & Gamble Company 21SEGMENT RESULTSSegment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation.

Favorable foreign exchange impacts increased net sales by 2%. Higher pricing increased net sales by 2%. Favorable product mix added 1% to net sales due to the disproportionate growth of the SK-II brand, which has higher than segment-average selling prices. Organic sales increased 6% on a 3% increase in organic volume. Global market share of the Beauty segment decreased 0.4 points. •Hair Care net sales increased mid-single digits due to a low single digit increase in volume and increased pricing. Organic sales also increased mid-single digits. Volume growth was driven by a double digit increase in Greater China (due to market growth and increased distribution), a high single digit increase in IMEA (due to innovation and the low base period due to pandemic-related shutdowns) and a mid-single digit increase in Latin America (due to product innovation), partially offset by a low single digit decrease in Europe due to pandemic-related category declines in certain markets. Global market share of the hair care category was unchanged.•Skin and Personal Care net sales increased high single digits due to a low single digit volume increase, favorable mix due to the disproportionate growth of the super premium SK-II brand, increased pricing and favorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales also increased high single digits. Volume increased double digits in Greater China and increased low single digits in North America driven by increased consumption of personal care products due to the pandemic. This volume growth was partially offset by a double digit decrease in IMEA and a low single digit decrease in Asia Pacific due to pandemic-related market contractions. Global market share of the skin and personal care category decreased nearly half a point.Net earnings increased 17% to $3.2 billion in fiscal 2021 due to the increase in net sales and a 180 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to an increase in gross margin and a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin increase was mainly driven by manufacturing cost savings and increased selling prices, partially offset by the negative impacts of unfavorable mix (due to the decline of the skin care category which has higher than segment-average margins and to a lesser extent the disproportionate growth of Latin America and IMEA, which have lower than segment-average margins) and increased commodity costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase.22 The Procter & Gamble CompanyGROOMING($ millions)20212020Change vs. 2020VolumeN/AN/A3%Net sales$6,440$6,0696%Net earnings$1,427$1,3297%% of net sales22.2%21.9%30 bpsGrooming net sales increased 6% to $6.4 billion in fiscal 2021 on a 3% increase in unit volume.

Foreign exchange had no net impact on net sales. Organic sales also increased 6%. Global market share of the Grooming segment decreased 0.6 points.•Shave Care net sales increased low single digits driven by a low single digit increase in volume and increased pricing, partially offset by unfavorable mix impacts due to the disproportionate growth of lower priced products in IMEA and Latin America. Organic sales also increased low single digits. The volume increase was driven by a mid-teens increase in IMEA (due to innovation and a low base period due to pandemic-related shutdowns), a high single digit increase in Greater China (due to innovation and market growth) and low-single digit increases in Latin America (due to innovation and distribution increases in certain markets) and in North America (due to innovation and a lower base period due to pandemic-related consumption declines), partially offset by a mid-single digit decline in Asia Pacific and a low single digit decline in Europe due to pandemic-related consumption declines. Global market share of the shave care category was unchanged.•Appliances net sales increased more than 20% primarily due to a high teens increase in volume, favorable foreign exchange impacts, favorable mix impact due to the disproportionate growth of premium shaver and styling products and increased pricing. Organic sales also increased more than 20%. Volume increased in all regions led by high teen increases in Europe and Greater China and double digit increases in North America and Asia Pacific, all driven by innovation and increased consumption of at-home grooming and styling products due to the pandemic. Global market share of the appliances category increased more than a point.Net earnings increased 7% to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2021 due to the increase in net sales and a 30 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales partially offset by a decrease in gross margin. Gross margin decreased due to the negative impact of unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of the appliances category and the IMEA region, both of which have lower than segment-average margins) and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by the positive impacts of manufacturing cost savings and increased selling prices. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and reductions in overhead costs due to productivity savings, partially offset by the impact of a favorable legal settlement in the base period.

Global market share of the Health Care segment increased 1.8 points.•Oral Care net sales increased double digits driven by a high-single digit volume increase, favorable mix impacts from the disproportionate growth of premium power brush and paste products, favorable foreign exchange impacts and increased pricing. Organic sales also increased double digits. Volume increased in all regions led by around 20% growth in IMEA, high single digit growth in North America, mid-single digits growth in Greater China and in Asia Pacific and low single digit growth in Europe due to product innovation, increased marketing spending and a low base period in certain markets due to pandemic-related shutdowns. Global market share of the oral care category increased more than a point.•Personal Health Care net sales increased mid-single digits driven by a mid-single digit increase in volume and increased pricing. Organic sales also increased mid-single digits. Volume increased mid-teens in Asia Pacific, increased double digits in Latin America and in IMEA, and increased mid-single digits in North America due to product innovation, increased marketing spending and increased consumption of certain health care products including supplements and pain relief. Global market share of the personal health care category increased more than a point.Net earnings increased 12% to $1.9 billion in fiscal 2021 due to the increase in net sales and a 30 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales partially offset by a decrease in gross margin. Gross margin decreased due to unfavorable mix impacts (due to the decline of higher-margin respiratory products and the disproportionate growth of oral care category, which has lower than segment-average margins) and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and increased selling prices. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase, partially offset by increased marketing spending.

The net earnings margin increased primarily due to an increase in gross margin, partially offset by an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin increase was driven by manufacturing cost savings and increased selling prices, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and unfavorable product mix (due to the disproportionate growth of products that are premium-priced and profit-accretive but with lower than segment-average margins). SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased due to an increase in marketing spending, partially offset by the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase.BABY, FEMININE & FAMILY CARE($ millions)20212020Change vs. 2020VolumeN/AN/A—%Net sales$18,850$18,3643%Net earnings$3,629$3,4655%% of net sales19.3%18.9%40 bpsBaby, Feminine & Family Care net sales increased 3% to $18.9 billion in fiscal 2021 on unit volume that was unchanged.

Organic sales were unchanged. The volume decrease was driven by a double digit decline in Greater China (due to competitive activities), mid-single digit declines in Asia Pacific (due to market contraction and competitive activity), Latin America (due to market contraction) and IMEA (due to pandemic-related retailer inventory reductions and market contraction) and a low single digit decline in Europe (due to market contractions and competitive activity in certain markets). These volume declines were partially offset by a low single digit volume increase in North America due to market growth and product innovation. Global market share of the baby care category decreased less than half a point.•Feminine Care net sales increased mid-single digits due to positive mix impacts (from the disproportionate growth of the North America region and premium products, such as adult incontinence, all of which have higher than category-average selling prices), increased pricing and favorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales also increased mid-single digits. Volume was unchanged as mid-single digits increases in North America (due to product innovation) and in IMEA (due to market growth, innovation and low base period due to pandemic-related economic slowdowns) were offset by a mid-single digit volume decrease in Europe (due to pandemic-related consumption declines) and low single digit decreases in Latin America, Greater China and Asia Pacific (all due to pandemic-related consumption 24 The Procter & Gamble Companydeclines, competitive activities in certain markets and, to a lesser extent, a high base period due to pandemic-related pantry loading).

Net earnings margin increased due to an increase in gross margin, partially offset by an increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales. The gross margin increase was driven by manufacturing cost savings and higher selling prices, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and unfavorable mix (due to the growth of large sizes which have lower than segment-average margins).

These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; certain employee benefit costs; other general corporate items; gains and losses related to certain divested brands; certain asset impairment charges; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate.Corporate net sales increased 12% to $441 million in fiscal 2021 due to an increase in the net sales of the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net loss increased by $153 million in fiscal 2021 primarily due to the $427 million ($512 million before tax) current period charge for early debt extinguishment. Excluding this charge, Corporate had net earnings of $40 million, an improvement of $274 million driven by lower restructuring charges versus the base period and the current period unrealized gain from an equity investment that became publicly traded in fiscal 2021, partially offset by higher interest expense and lower interest income in the current period. Each of these items have been discussed above. Restructuring Program to Deliver Productivity and Cost SavingsThe Company has historically had an ongoing restructuring program with annual spending in the range of $250 to $500 million. In fiscal 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan, in addition to our ongoing restructuring-type activities, to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. In fiscal 2017, the Company communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings program. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to both fund the Company's growth strategy and increase the Company's operating margin. The plan was substantially completed in fiscal 2020, with spending totaling approximately $782 million in that year.Savings generated from the Company's restructuring program are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. However, we estimate that the underlying restructuring costs incurred since 2012 (approximately $8.2 billion), along with other non-manufacturing enrollment reductions since 2012 have delivered approximately $3.7 billion in annual before-tax gross savings. In fiscal 2021, the Company incurred restructuring costs within the range of our historical ongoing level of $250 to $500 million annually.Restructuring accruals of $278 million as of June 30, 2021 are classified as current liabilities. Approximately 91% of the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2021 either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting.In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins.Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program and to the Operating Costs section of the MD&A for more information about the total benefit to operating margins from our total savings efforts.CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates.Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and The Procter & Gamble Company 25acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.Cash Flow Analysis($ millions)20212020Net cash provided by operating activities$18,371 $17,403 Net cash provided/(used) by investing activities(2,834)3,045 Net cash used in financing activities(21,531)(8,367)Adjusted Free Cash Flow15,809 14,873 Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity107 %114 %Operating Cash FlowOperating cash flow was $18.4 billion in 2021, a 6% increase from the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, loss on early extinguishment of debt, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets) generated approximately $17.9 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts generated $506 million of operating cash flow as summarized below.•An increase in accounts receivable used $342 million of cash primarily due to sales growth and lower relative sales at the end of the base period in certain markets due to COVID-19. The number of days sales outstanding increased approximately 1 day versus prior year.•Higher inventory used $309 million of cash, primarily due to commodity cost increases and business growth. Inventory days on hand increased approximately 2 days primarily due to these same factors. •Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $1.4 billion of cash. About half of this was driven by extended payment terms with our suppliers (see Extended Payment Terms and Supply Chain Financing below). The remaining amount was driven by higher current period marketing spending and to support the increase in inventory. Days payable outstanding is approximately 87 days as of June 30, 2021, an increase of 6 days versus prior year due to these same factors.•Other net operating assets and liabilities declined, using $369 million of cash, primarily driven by the payment of the current year portion of transitional taxes due related to the U.S. Tax Act repatriation charge ($225 million) and pension related accruals and contributions.Adjusted Free Cash Flow. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important non-GAAP measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act and tax payments related to the Merck acquisition. Adjusted free cash flow is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation. Adjusted free cash flow was $15.8 billion in 2021, an increase of 6% versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in operating cash flows as discussed above. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings, excluding the charges for early debt extinguishment (which are not considered part of our ongoing operations), was 107% in 2021. Extended Payment Terms and Supply Chain Financing. Beginning in fiscal 2014, in response to evolving market practices, the Company began a program to negotiate extended payment terms with its suppliers. At the same time, the Company initiated a Supply Chain Finance program (the ""SCF"") with a number of global financial institutions (the ""SCF Banks""). Under the SCF, qualifying suppliers may elect to sell their receivables from the company to a SCF Bank. These participating suppliers negotiate their receivables sales arrangements directly with the respective SCF Bank. While the Company is not party to those agreements, the SCF Banks allow the participating suppliers to utilize the Company’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs. This generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. The Company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier elects to participate in the SCF and reaches an agreement with an SCF Bank, they elect which individual Company invoices they sell to the SCF bank. However, all the Company’s payments to participating suppliers are paid to the SCF Bank on the invoice due date, regardless of whether the individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the SCF Bank. The SCF Bank pays the supplier on the invoice due date for any invoices that were not previously sold to the SCF Bank under the SCF.The terms of the Company’s payment obligation are not impacted by a supplier’s participation in the SCF. Our payment terms with our suppliers for similar services and materials within individual markets are consistent between suppliers that elect to participate in the SCF and those that do not participate. Accordingly, our average days outstanding are not significantly impacted by the portion of suppliers or related input costs that are included in the SCF. In addition, the SCF is available to both material suppliers, where the underlying costs are largely included in Cost of goods sold, and to service suppliers, where the underlying costs are largely included in SG&A. As of June 30, 2021, approximately 3% of our global suppliers have elected to participate in the SCF. Payments to those suppliers during fiscal year 2021 total approximately $15 billion, which equals approximately 26% of our total Cost of goods sold and SG&A for the period. For participating suppliers, we believe substantially all of their receivables with the 26 The Procter & Gamble CompanyCompany are sold to the SCF Banks. Accordingly, we would expect that at each balance sheet date, a similar proportion of amounts originally due to suppliers would instead be payable to SCF Banks. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in the SCF are recorded within Accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the amount due to suppliers participating in the SCF and included in Accounts payable were approximately $5 billion and $4 billion, respectively.Although difficult to project due to market and other dynamics, we anticipate incremental cash flow benefits from the extended payment terms with suppliers could increase at a slower rate in fiscal 2022. Future changes in our suppliers’ financing policies or economic developments, such as changes in interest rates, general market liquidity or the Company’s credit-worthiness relative to participating suppliers could impact suppliers’ participation in the SCF and/or our ability to negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers. However, any such impacts are difficult to predict.Investing Cash FlowNet investing activities used $2.8 billion in cash in 2021, primarily due to capital spending. Net investing activities generated $3.0 billion in cash in 2020, mainly due to proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities, partially offset by capital spending. Capital Spending. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost efficiencies, were $2.8 billion in 2021 and $3.1 billion in 2020. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 60 basis points to 3.7% in 2021. Acquisitions. Acquisition activity used cash of $34 million in 2021, primarily related to a minor Health Care acquisition. Acquisition activity used $58 million in 2020, primarily related to final contractual payments from the fiscal 2019 acquisition of Merck OTC, along with a minor Baby Care acquisition. Proceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales were $42 million in 2021, primarily from fixed asset sales and a minor brand divestiture and $30 million in 2020, primarily from a minor brand divestiture. Investment Securities. Investments used net cash of $55 million in 2021 primarily from the purchase of investment securities and generated $6.2 billion in 2020 primarily from sales and maturities of investment securities. Financing Cash FlowNet financing activities consumed $21.5 billion of cash in 2021, mainly due to treasury stock purchases, dividends to shareholders and net debt reductions, partially offset by the impact of proceeds received from stock option exercises. Net financing activities consumed $8.4 billion in cash in 2020, mainly due to treasury stock purchases and dividends to shareholders, partially offset by a net debt increase and the impact of stock options. Dividend Payments. Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments. Dividends per common share increased 7% to $3.2419 per share in 2021. Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $8.3 billion in 2021 and $7.8 billion in 2020. In April 2021, the Board of Directors declared a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.7907 to $0.8698 per share on Common Stock and Series A and B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock. This is the 65th consecutive year that our dividend has increased. We have paid a dividend for 131 consecutive years, every year since our incorporation in 1890.Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $32.0 billion as of June 30, 2021 and $34.7 billion as of June 30, 2020. We used $3.9 billion for net debt reductions, including $512 million for early debt extinguishment costs related to the early retirement of $2.3 billion of debt. In 2020, we generated $4.8 billion from net debt increases, primarily due to the issuance of bonds of $5.0 billion.Treasury Purchases. Total share repurchases were $11.0 billion in 2021 and $7.4 billion in 2020. Impact of Stock Options and Other. The exercise of stock options and other financing activities generated $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion of cash in 2021 and 2020, respectively. LiquidityAt June 30, 2021, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $10.0 billion, largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had $4.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents related to foreign subsidiaries, primarily in various Western European and Asian countries. We did not have material cash and cash equivalents related to any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds. Under current law, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future. We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled, and should continue to enable, us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient funding to meet short-term financing requirements.The Procter & Gamble Company 27On June 30, 2021, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard & Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings were Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard & Poor's), all with a stable outlook.We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $8.0 billion facility split between a $3.2 billion five-year facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire in November 2025 and November 2021, respectively. Both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities. For additional details on debt see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.Contractual CommitmentsThe following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2021.($ millions)TotalLess Than 1 Year1-3 Years3-5 YearsAfter 5 YearsRECORDED LIABILITIESTotal debt$31,967 $8,880 $4,928 $4,858 $13,301 Leases953 219 349 175 210 U.S. Tax Act transitional charge (1)2,115 224 645 1,246 — Uncertain tax positions (2)9 9 — — — OTHERInterest payments relating to long-term debt5,020 599 1,010 866 2,545 Minimum pension funding (3)552 179 373 — — Purchase obligations (4)1,982 809 599 259 315 TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS$42,598 $10,919 $7,904 $7,404 $16,371 (1)Represents the U.S. federal tax liability associated with the repatriation provisions of the U.S. Tax Act. Does not include any provisions made for foreign withholding taxes on expected repatriations as the timing of those payments is uncertain.(2)As of June 30, 2021, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $803 million, including $176 million of interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year, a reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of June 30, 2021 cannot be made.(3)Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2023 are not currently determinable.(4)Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent minimum commitments with suppliers and are in line with expected usage. This includes service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position. 28 The Procter & Gamble CompanySIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include revenue recognition, income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.The Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.Revenue RecognitionOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, in-store merchandising funds, advertising and other promotional activities, and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale. Amounts accrued for trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation, based on contractual terms, sales volumes and historical utilization and redemption rates. The actual amounts paid may be different from such estimates. These differences, which have historically not been significant, are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgements and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, and our ability to uphold certain tax positions.Realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.A core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model, such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities in the jurisdictions where those functions are performed. However, because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts, we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various cross-border transactions. We have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty. We estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70% of our global earnings. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Because there are a number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the Company's income taxes.Employee BenefitsWe sponsor various postretirement benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other postretirement benefit (OPRB) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPRB plans require assumptions to estimate the net projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and net obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service The Procter & Gamble Company 29cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPRB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2021, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPRB assets was 6.5% and 8.4%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPRB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit/expense by approximately $140 million.Since pension and OPRB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPRB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans of 1.7% represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $210 million. The average discount rate on the OPRB plan of 3.2% reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the U.S., which is where a majority of the plan participants receive benefits. A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax OPRB expense by approximately $15 million. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPRB plans.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsSignificant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations. We typically estimate the fair value of these assets using the income method, which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. The valuations used to establish and to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin progression, Company business plans and the discount rate applied to cash flows.Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized, but are tested at least annually for impairment. Our ongoing annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the 3 months ended December 31. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. For example, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. In addition, changes to, or a failure to achieve business plans or deterioration of macroeconomic conditions could result in reduced cash flows or higher discount rates, leading to a lower valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses.We test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the book value of each asset to the estimated fair value. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. If the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment.Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, all customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. An impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high as our legacy businesses. The Appliances reporting unit has a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value. During fiscal 2019, a non-cash before- and after-tax impairment charge of $6.8 billion was recognized to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill for the Shave Care reporting unit, and a non-cash, before-tax impairment charge 30 The Procter & Gamble Companyof $1.6 billion ($1.2 billion after-tax) was recognized to reduce the carrying amount of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to its fair value. The underlying reductions in fair values were due in large part to significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar, a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits, primarily in the developed markets, and an increased competitive market environment in the U.S. and certain other markets. As a result of the fiscal 2019 impairment determined by the step two testing (that existed under previous accounting standards), the Shave Care fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 20% as of June 30, 2019. Because the impairment testing for intangible assets has historically been a one-step process, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value approximated its carrying value at that date. During our annual impairment testing during the quarter ended December 31, 2019, we reduced the discount rate used in the valuation based on developments in the macroeconomic environment. As a result of this change and updates to other underlying cash flow projections, the Shave Care fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 20% and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5%. The COVID-19 pandemic that originated during the second half of fiscal 2020 resulted in a reduction in shave incidents by consumers and a weakening of certain currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which led to a reduction in net sales for Gillette-branded products. This resulted in a triggering event for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset, which caused us to perform an additional impairment assessment for that asset as of June 30, 2020. That assessment indicated that the fair value of the Gillette trade name approximated its carrying value. Accordingly, no impairment charge was recorded during the year ended June 30, 2020. Based on our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Shave Care reporting unit's fair value continued to exceed its carrying value by more than 20% and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value continued to approximate its carrying value. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates (including residual growth rates) and discount rate. The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans and approximates expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate is dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. Another key assumption in our fair value determination of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is the royalty rate, which is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins. While management can and has implemented strategies to address these events in the past, changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the Shave Care reporting unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. The duration and severity of the pandemic could result in additional future impairment charges for the Shave Care reporting unit goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. While we have concluded that a triggering event did not occur during the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is most susceptible to future impairment risk. Our assessment of the Gillette intangible asset assumes the net sales growth rates will begin to recover from the impact of the pandemic during the next fiscal year. There continues to be a high level of uncertainty relating to how the pandemic will evolve, how governments and consumers will react and progress on the distribution of vaccines. Accordingly, there continues to be risk related to this key assumption. A more prolonged pandemic recovery period could impact the assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset that are significant enough to trigger an impairment. Net sales and earnings growth rates could be negatively impacted by more prolonged reductions or changes in demand for our shave care products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, financial hardship, changes in the use and frequency of grooming products or by shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries’ currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Finally, the discount rate utilized in our valuation model could be impacted by changes in the underlying interest rates and risk premiums included in the determination of the cost of The Procter & Gamble Company 31capital. As of June 30, 2021, the carrying values of the Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were $12.8 billion and $14.1 billion, respectively. We performed a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset during our annual impairment testing, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorter-term and residual growth rates, the discount rate, and the royalty rate to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis point decrease in our shorter-term and residual growth rates, or a 50 basis point decrease in our royalty rate, any of which, in isolation, would result in an impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.

We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. We leverage the Company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility within our financing operations, as discussed below, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments.Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the RiskManager™ value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics™ dataset as of June 30, 2021. In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics™, a reasonable proxy is included.Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term.Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments.Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June 30, 2021, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements.Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps with maturities of less than 18 months. Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2021, we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact on such instruments of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements.Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures.As of and during the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, we did not have any financial commodity hedging activity. 32 The Procter & Gamble CompanyMeasures Not Defined By U.S. GAAPIn accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. These measures include:Organic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth:Year ended June 30, 2021Net Sales GrowthForeign Exchange ImpactAcquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other (1)Organic Sales GrowthBeauty8 %(2)%— %6 %Grooming6 %— %— %6 %Health Care10 %(1)%— %9 %Fabric & Home Care10 %(1)%— %9 %Baby, Feminine & Family Care3 %(1)%— %2 %TOTAL COMPANY7 %(1)%— %6 %(1) Acquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other includes the volume and mix impact of acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales.Adjusted Free Cash Flow. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending, tax payments related to the Merck OTC Consumer Healthcare acquisition in 2020 and transitional tax payments resulting from the U.S. Tax Act in 2021 and 2020 (the Company incurred a transitional tax liability of approximately $3.8 billion from the U.S. Tax Act, which is payable over a period of 8 years). Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow ($ millions):OperatingCash FlowCapitalSpendingAdjustments to Operating Cash Flow (1)Adjusted FreeCash Flow2021$18,371 $(2,787)$225 $15,809 2020$17,403 $(3,073)$543 $14,873 (1) Adjustments to Operating Cash Flow include transitional tax payments resulting from the U.S. Tax Act of $225 and $215 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and tax payments related to the Merck acquisition of $328 in 2020.Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the charges for early debt extinguishment (which are not considered part of our ongoing operations). We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent.The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow productivity ($ millions):Adjusted Free Cash FlowNetEarningsEarly Debt Extinguishment ChargesNet Earnings Excluding AdjustmentsAdjusted FreeCash FlowProductivity2021$15,809 $14,352 $427 $14,779 107 %202014,873 13,103 — 13,103 114 %The Procter & Gamble Company 33Core EPS. Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. Core EPS is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The table below provides a reconciliation of diluted net earnings per share to Core EPS, including the following reconciling items:•Charges for early debt extinguishment: During fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded after tax charges of $427 million ($512 million before tax), due to the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt. These charges represent the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished.•Incremental Restructuring: The Company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. Beginning in fiscal 2012, the Company had a strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that resulted in incremental restructuring charges through fiscal 2020. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. In fiscal 2021, the Company incurred restructuring costs within our historical ongoing level. We do not view the above items to be indicative of underlying business results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES(Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Reconciliation of Non-GAAP MeasuresTwelve Months Ended June 30, 2021Twelve Months Ended June 30, 2020AS REPORTED (GAAP)EARLY DEBT EXTINGUISHMENTNON-GAAP (CORE)AS REPORTED (GAAP)INCREMENTAL RESTRUCTURINGNON-GAAP (CORE)NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO P&G14,306 427 14,733 13,027 415 13,442 Core EPSCore EPSDILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (1)$5.50 $0.16 $5.66 $4.96 $0.16 $5.12 (1) Diluted net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble.

The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, 14 The Procter & Gamble Companyand should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections:•Overview•Summary of 2022 Results •Economic Conditions and Uncertainties•Results of Operations•Segment Results•Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity•Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates•Other InformationThroughout the MD&A we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per share and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), consisting of organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Core EPS is diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending and transitional tax payments related to the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding certain one-time items. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures quarter and fiscal year-to-date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. OVERVIEWProcter & Gamble is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world.

The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class services and solutions that drive value for P&G.Strategic FocusProcter & Gamble aspires to serve the world’s consumers better than our best competitors in every category and in every country in which we compete and, as a result, deliver total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. Delivering and sustaining leadership levels of shareholder value creation requires balanced top- and bottom-line growth and strong cash generation.The Company competes in daily-use product categories where performance plays a significant role in the consumer's choice of brands, and therefore, play to P&G's strengths. Our focused portfolio of businesses consists of ten product categories where P&G has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies.Within these categories, our strategic choices are focused on delighting and winning with consumers. Our consumers are at the center of everything we do. We win with consumers by delivering irresistible superiority across five key vectors - product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value. Winning with consumers around the world and against our best competitors requires superior innovation. Innovation has always been, and continues to be, P&G’s lifeblood. Superior products delivered with superior execution drive market growth, value creation for retailers and build share growth for P&G.Ongoing productivity improvement is crucial to delivering our balanced top- and bottom-line growth, cash generation and value creation objectives. Productivity improvement enables investments to strengthen the superiority of our brands via product and packaging innovation, more efficient and effective supply chains, equity and awareness-building brand advertising and other programs and expansion of sales coverage and R&D programs. Productivity improvements also enable us to mitigate challenging cost environments (including periods of increasing commodity and negative foreign exchange impacts). Our objective is to drive productivity improvements across all elements of the statement of earnings and balance sheet, including cost of goods sold, marketing and promotional spending, overhead costs and capital spending. We act with agility and are constructively disrupting our highly competitive industry and the way we do business, including how we innovate, communicate and leverage new technologies, to create more value.We are improving operational effectiveness and organizational culture through enhanced clarity of roles and responsibilities, accountability and incentive compensation programs.Additionally, within these strategies of superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization, we have declared four focus areas to strengthen our performance going forward. These are 1) leveraging environmental sustainability as an additional driver of superior performing products and packaging innovations, 2) increasing digital acumen to drive consumer and customer preference, reduce cost and enable rapid and efficient decision making, 3) developing next-level supply chain capabilities to enable flexibility, agility, resilience and a new level of productivity adapting to a new reality and 4) delivering employee value equation for all gender identities, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent.We believe these strategies are right for the long-term health of the Company and our objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group.The Company expects the delivery of the following long-term growth algorithm will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive, fast-moving consumer goods peer group:•Organic sales growth above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete;•Core earnings per share (EPS) growth of mid-to-high single digits; and•Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater.During periods of significant macroeconomic pressures, we intend to maintain a disciplined approach to investing in our business, which may cause short-term results to deviate from the long-term growth algorithm.

Unfavorable foreign exchange had a negative 2% impact on net sales. Net sales growth was driven by a high single digit increase in Health Care, mid-single digit increases in Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care and low single digit increases in Beauty and Grooming. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, Organic sales increased 7% on a 2% increase in organic volume. Organic sales increased double digits in Health Care, increased high single digits in Fabric & Home Care, increased mid-single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care and in Grooming and increased low single digits in Beauty. •Operating income decreased $0.2 billion, or 1% versus year ago to $17.8 billion, as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a decrease in operating margin.•Net earnings increased $0.4 billion or 3% versus year ago to $14.8 billion, due to a prior year loss on early debt extinguishment, lower taxes and interest expense in the current year. Foreign exchange impacts negatively affected net earnings by approximately $274 million. •Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $14.7 billion, an increase of $0.4 billion or 3% versus the prior year primarily due to the increase in net earnings.•Diluted net earnings per share (EPS) increased 6% to $5.81 due to the increase in net earnings, a reduction in shares outstanding and due to the prior year loss on early debt extinguishment. Net earnings per share increased 3% versus the prior year core net earnings per share due to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in shares outstanding.•Cash flow from operating activities was $16.7 billion.◦ Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures and certain other impacts, was $13.8 billion.◦ Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings, was 93%.ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIESWe discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are ""forward-looking statements"" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors, except as required by law. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.Global Economic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Global economic conditions continue to be volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in market size contractions in certain countries due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement. Other macroeconomic factors also remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as greater political unrest or instability in the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe (including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine War), certain Latin American markets, the Hong Kong market in Greater China and the Korean peninsula could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin and consequently reduce our net earnings and cash flows.Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs, other broader inflationary impacts and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations, including energy shortages, port congestions, labor constraints and freight container and truck shortages have impacted our costs and could do so in the future. If we are unable to manage these impacts through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through 18 The Procter & Gamble Companyconsistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Net sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on the consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.Foreign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In the past three years, a number of foreign currencies have weakened versus the U.S. dollar, leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries that recently had and are currently experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations include Argentina, Turkey, Brazil and Russia. These fluctuations have significantly impacted our historical net sales, costs and net earnings and could do so in the future. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on the consumption of our products, which would negatively affect our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.Government Policies. Our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies. For example, our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, or any significant change in global tax policy adopted under the current work being led by the OECD for the G20 focused on ""Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy."" The breadth of the OECD project extends beyond pure digital businesses, and if agreed and enacted by most countries, is likely to impact most large multinational businesses by both redefining jurisdictional taxation rights and broadly establishing a 15% minimum tax on their foreign operations. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and climate change matters. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Turkey, Argentina and Egypt. Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.COVID-19 Pandemic. Because we sell products that are essential to the daily lives of consumers, the pandemic has not had a materially negative impact to our consolidated net sales, net earnings and cash flows. However, the continued evolution of the pandemic may result in economic recessions or a slowdown of economic growth in certain countries or regions. It could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products (due to governmental actions or key material, transportation and labor shortages impacting our ability to produce and ship products) or could impact consumers’ movements and access to our products. There could also be reduced demand due to consumption decreases and consumer pantry destocking (particularly, in home cleaning, health and hygiene products) as economic activity resumes following slowdowns or relaxation of governmental restrictions. Net, the uncertainty in the timing and extent of demand volatility, the relaxation and reimplementation of movement restrictions, the timing and impact of potential consumer pantry destocking, the future economic trends due to a resurgence of positive cases and governmental actions in response to the pandemic may result in heightened volatility and negative impacts to net sales, net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to the pandemic.While we have been able to broadly maintain our operations, we experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain markets due primarily to the restriction of employee movements, key material and labor shortages and transportation constraints. We intend to continue to work with our suppliers and government authorities to implement employee safety measures to minimize disruption to the manufacturing and distribution of our products. The continued evolution of the pandemic and uncertainty with regards to the disruptions caused either by resurgence of positive cases or governmental actions in response to the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain and impact our operations (for example, the closure of a key manufacturing or distribution facility or the inability of a key material or transportation supplier to source and transport materials).The pandemic has not had a material negative impact on the Company’s liquidity position. We continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our short-term liquidity needs and continue to maintain access to capital markets enabled by our strong short- and long-term credit ratings. Russia-Ukraine War. The war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted our operations in both countries. Our Ukraine business includes two manufacturing sites. We have approximately 500 employees including both manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel. Our operations in Ukraine accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales and net earnings in fiscal 2022. Additionally, net assets of our Ukraine subsidiary, along The Procter & Gamble Company 19with Ukraine related assets held by other subsidiaries, account for less than 1% of net assets as of June 30, 2022. Our Russia business includes two manufacturing sites with a net book value of approximately $350 million as of June 30, 2022. We have approximately 2,400 employees, including both manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel. In fiscal 2022, our operations in Russia accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net sales and less than 1% of net earnings. Additionally, net assets of our Russia subsidiaries, along with Russia related assets held by other subsidiaries, account for less than 2% of net assets as of June 30, 2022. Beginning in March 2022, the Company has reduced its product portfolio, discontinued new capital investments and suspended media, advertising and promotional activity in Russia. Future impacts to the Company are difficult to predict due to the high level of uncertainty as to how the war will evolve, what its duration will be and its ultimate resolution. Within Ukraine, there is a possibility of physical damage and destruction of our two manufacturing facilities. We may not be able to operate our manufacturing sites and source raw materials from our suppliers or ship finished products to our customers. Ultimately, these could result in impairments of our manufacturing plants and fixed assets or write-downs of other operating assets and working capital.Within Russia, we may not be able to continue our reduced operations at current levels due to sanctions and counter-sanctions, monetary, currency or payment controls, restrictions on access to financial institutions and supply and transportation challenges. Our suppliers, distributors and retail customers are also impacted by the war and their ability to successfully maintain their operations could also impact our operations or negatively impact the sales of our products. More broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales, earnings and cash flows should the situation escalate beyond its current scope, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures and supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of Europe. For additional information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe key metrics included in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative costs (SG&A), operating margin, other non-operating items, income taxes and net earnings. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of initiatives, pricing and other activities by competitors), marketing spending, retail executions (both in-store and online) and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as our pricing actions (which can also impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign exchange impacts on sales outside the U.S.For most of our categories, our cost of products sold and SG&A are variable in nature to some extent. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in North America are generally higher than the Company average for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for example, product or package improvements) and, to a lesser extent, scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary components of SG&A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. While overhead costs are variable to some extent, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems' infrastructures to support business growth. The main drivers of changes in SG&A as a percentage of net sales are overhead and marketing cost savings, reinvestments (for example, increased advertising), inflation, foreign exchange fluctuations and scale impacts.For a detailed discussion of the fiscal 2021 year-over-year changes, please refer to the MD&A in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.Net SalesNet sales increased 5% to $80.2 billion in fiscal 2022 on a 2% increase in unit volume versus the prior year. Unfavorable foreign exchange decreased net sales by 2%. Favorable pricing had a 4% positive impact on net sales. Mix increased net sales by 1% due to positive geographic mix from the disproportionate growth of the North America region and positive category mix from the disproportionate growth of the Personal Health Care category, both of which have higher than Company-average selling prices. This was partially offset by the disproportionate growth of the Fabric Care business, which has lower than Company-average selling prices. Excluding the net impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, organic sales grew 7% on a 2% increase in organic volume. Net sales increased high single digits in Health Care, increased mid-single digits in Fabric & Home Care and in Baby, Feminine & Family Care and increased low single digits in Beauty and Grooming.On a regional basis, volume increased mid-single digits in North America and Latin America, increased low single digits in Asia Pacific and IMEA. Volume in Europe was unchanged and decreased mid-single digits in Greater China.20 The Procter & Gamble CompanyOperating CostsComparisons as a percentage of net sales; Years ended June 3020222021Basis Point ChangeGross margin47.4 %51.2 %(380)Selling, general and administrative expense25.2 %27.6 %(240)Operating margin22.2 %23.6 %(140)Earnings before income taxes22.4 %23.1 %(70)Net earnings18.4 %18.9 %(50)Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble18.4 %18.8 %(40) Gross margin decreased 380 basis points to 47.4% of net sales in fiscal 2022. The decrease in gross margin was due to:•390 basis points of increased commodity costs,•a 130 basis-point decline from unfavorable mix, due primarily to negative product mix resulting from the launch and growth of premium-priced products that are profit-accretive but have lower than Company-average gross margin, and•40 basis points of net manufacturing cost increases, as 60 basis points of increased transportation costs and 20 basis points of product and packaging investments were partially offset by 40 basis points of productivity savings net of inflation and other cost increases.These impacts were partially offset by a 180 basis-point increase due to higher pricing.Total SG&A decreased 4% to $20.2 billion, due to decreased overhead costs, marketing spending and other operating costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 240 basis points to 25.2% primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in overhead costs and marketing spending. •Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 120 basis points due primarily to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and, to a lesser extent, due to increased media and production cost savings and decreased media spending.•Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 110 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings.•Other net operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 10 basis points due primarily to gains from the divestiture of a minor business and sale of real estate, partially offset by increased foreign exchange transactional charges.Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 70 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales.Operating margin decreased 140 basis points to 22.2% due to the decrease in gross margin partially offset by the decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales as discussed above.Non-Operating Items•Interest expense was $439 million in fiscal 2022, a decrease of $63 million versus the prior year driven primarily by lower average interest rates on fixed rate debt.•Interest income was $51 million in fiscal 2022, an increase of $6 million versus the prior year.•Other non-operating income increased $484 million to $570 million, due primarily to a prior year loss on early-debt extinguishment and a current year increase in net non-operating benefits on post-retirement benefit plans, partially offset by unrealized gains on equity investments in the prior year and unrealized losses on equity investments in the current year. Income TaxesThe effective tax rate decreased 70 basis points to 17.8% in 2022 due to:•a 45 basis-point decrease from higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (a 200 basis-point benefit in the current year versus a 155 basis-point benefit in the prior year),•a 30 basis-point decrease from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (35 basis-point favorable impact in the current year versus a 5 basis-point favorable impact in the prior year), and•a 15 basis-point decrease from higher current year deductions for foreign-derived intangible income versus prior year.These decreases were partially offset by a 20 basis-point increase due to unfavorable geographic mix impacts of current year earnings.Net EarningsOperating income decreased 1% or $0.2 billion, to $17.8 billion as the increase in net sales was more than fully offset by the decrease in operating margin, both of which are discussed above. Earnings before income taxes increased 2%, or $0.4 billion, to $18.0 billion, as the decrease in operating income was more than fully offset by a prior year loss on early-debt extinguishment and lower interest expense. Net earnings increased 3%, or $0.4 billion, to $14.8 billion due to the increase in earnings before income taxes and the decrease in the effective income tax rate discussed above. Foreign The Procter & Gamble Company 21exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $274 million in fiscal 2022 due to a weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar. This impact includes both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $0.4 billion, or 3%, to $14.7 billion. Diluted net EPS increased $0.31, or 6%, to $5.81 due primarily to the increase in net earnings and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in shares outstanding. Net earnings per share increased 3% versus the prior year core EPS due to the prior year loss on early debt extinguishment.SEGMENT RESULTSSegment results reflect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. The results of these reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs which are reported in our Corporate segment and are included as part of our Corporate segment discussion. Additionally, we apply blended statutory tax rates in the segments. Eliminations to adjust segment results to arrive at our consolidated effective tax rate are included in Corporate.

Higher pricing increased net sales by 3%. Foreign exchange had no impact on net sales. Unfavorable mix decreased net sales by 1% due to the disproportionate decline of SK-II, which has higher than segment-average selling prices. Organic sales also increased 2%. Global market share of the Beauty segment increased 0.1 points. •Hair Care net sales increased low single digits. A negative impact of a low single digit decrease in volume was more than offset by increased pricing and favorable mix (due to a higher proportion of premium products, which have higher than category-average selling prices). Organic sales also increased low single digits. Volume decreased mid-single digits in Greater China (due to pandemic-related lockdowns and market slowdown in traditional retailers where our shares are disproportionately higher versus social commerce) and IMEA (due to competitive activity) and decreased low single digits in Europe (as a result of portfolio reduction in Russia and higher pricing in certain markets) and Asia Pacific (due to competitive activity). This was offset by a low single digit volume increase in North America (due to acquisitions). Excluding the impacts of acquisitions, volume was unchanged in North America. Global market share of the hair care category decreased less than a point.•Skin and Personal Care net sales increased low single digits. Positive impacts of a low single digit increase in volume and increased pricing were partially offset by negative category mix due to the decline of SK-II brand (which has higher than category-average selling prices). Organic sales increased low single digits. Volume increased mid-teens in Latin America (due to innovation) and increased mid-single digits in North America (due to innovation in personal care and acquisitions) and in Greater China (due to innovation and market growth). Global market share of the skin and personal care category increased half a point.Net earnings decreased 2% to $3.2 billion in fiscal 2022 as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 90 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due primarily to a reduction in gross margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of sales. The gross margin reduction was driven by increased commodity and transportation costs and negative product mix caused by the decline of SK-II (which has higher than 22 The Procter & Gamble Companysegment-average gross margins), partially offset by increased pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased as the positive scale benefit of the net sales increase and increased cost savings in marketing spending were partially offset by an increase in overhead costs.GROOMING($ millions)20222021Change vs. 2021VolumeN/AN/A—%Net sales$6,587$6,4402%Net earnings$1,490$1,4274%% of net sales22.6%22.2%40 bpsGrooming net sales increased 2% to $6.6 billion in fiscal 2022 on unit volume that was unchanged.

Global market share of the Grooming segment increased 1.2 points.•Shave Care net sales increased mid-single digits. Positive impacts of a low single digit volume increase and increased pricing were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales increased high single digits. Volume increased low single digits in North America (due to innovation), Europe (due to innovation and market growth versus the prior year that was negatively impacted by the pandemic), IMEA (due to market growth) and Latin America (due to innovation). This was partially offset by a high teens decline in Greater China (due to pandemic-related shutdowns and market slowdown in traditional retailers where our shares are disproportionately higher versus social commerce retailers). Global market share of the shave care category increased nearly half a point.•Appliances net sales decreased mid-single digits. Negative impacts of a high single digit decline in volume and unfavorable foreign exchange were partially offset by increased pricing (net of increased trade spending) and positive mix (due to a higher proportion of premium shavers and epilators, which have higher than category-average selling prices). Organic sales decreased low single digits. Volume declined double digits in Europe, mid-single digits in North America and low single digits in Asia Pacific, all due to market declines versus the prior year that benefited from pandemic-related consumption increases. Excluding the impact of a divestiture, volume declined high single digits in Europe. Global market share of the appliances category increased less than a point.Net earnings increased 4% to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2022 due to the increase in net sales and a 40 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increased due to a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin and a higher effective tax rate. The gross margin decrease was driven by negative product mix (due to the launch and growth of premium-priced, profit-accretive products that have lower than segment-average gross margins) and increased commodity and transportation costs, partially offset by increased pricing and manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due primarily to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. The higher effective tax rate was driven by disproportionate growth in North America, which has higher than segment-average tax rates.

Higher pricing increased net sales by 3%. Organic sales increased 10%. Global market share of the Health Care segment decreased 0.2 points.•Oral Care net sales increased low single digits. A negative impact of a low single digit volume decrease and unfavorable foreign exchange were more than fully offset by the positive impacts from favorable mix (due to growth in North America and a higher proportion of premium tier products, both of which have higher than category-average selling prices) and increased pricing. Organic sales increased mid-single digits. Volume decreased low teens in Greater China (due to slowdown of the power brush market and pandemic-related lockdowns) and mid-single digits in Europe (as a result of supply constraints primarily due to the global chip shortage). This was partially offset by a double digit increase in Asia Pacific (due to distribution gains and market growth), a mid-single digit increase in IMEA (due to market growth and innovation) and low single digit increases in North America and Latin America (both due to market growth and innovation). Global market share of the oral care category increased half a point.•Personal Health Care net sales increased high-teens. This was due primarily to a low teens increase in volume, increased pricing, increased trade spend efficiencies and positive mix (due to the disproportionate growth in North America and respiratory products, both of which have higher than category-average selling prices), partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales increased about 20%. Volume increased high teens in North America, increased high single digits in Europe (both due to stronger respiratory seasons and innovation) and increased mid-single digits in IMEA (due to innovation, increased marketing spending and distribution gains). Global market share of the personal health care category increased less than half a point.The Procter & Gamble Company 23Net earnings increased 8% to $2.0 billion in fiscal 2022 due primarily to the increase in net sales. Net earnings margin decreased slightly as a decrease in gross margin and a higher effective tax rate were mostly offset by a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The decrease in gross margin was driven primarily by increased commodity and transportation costs and other cost increases associated with the global chip shortage, partially offset by increased pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and overhead productivity, partially offset by an increase in media spending. The higher effective tax rate was driven by disproportionate growth in North America, which has higher than segment-average tax rates.FABRIC & HOME CARE($ millions)20222021Change vs. 2021VolumeN/AN/A3%Net sales$27,556$26,0146%Net earnings$4,386$4,622(5)%% of net sales15.9%17.8%(190) bpsFabric & Home Care net sales increased 6% to $27.6 billion in fiscal 2022 on a 3% increase in unit volume.

The positive impacts of a mid-single digit increase in volume, increased pricing, increased trade spend efficiencies and positive mix (due to the disproportionate growth in North America and growth of fabric enhancers and premium forms, all of which have higher than category-average selling prices) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales increased double digits. Volume increased high single digits in North America and increased low single digits in Asia Pacific, both due to market growth and innovation. Global market share of the fabric care category increased more than a point.•Home Care net sales were unchanged. Negative impacts of a low single digit decrease in volume, increased trade spending and unfavorable foreign exchange were offset by increased pricing. Organic sales increased low single digits. Volume decreased 20% in IMEA (due to market contraction and competitive activity) and decreased low single digits in North America (due to market contraction versus a prior year that benefited from pandemic-related consumption increases). Global market share of the home care category increased more than a point.Net earnings decreased 5% to $4.4 billion in fiscal 2022 as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 190 basis-point reduction in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due primarily to a reduction in gross margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin decrease was primarily driven by an increase in commodity and transportation costs, and unfavorable mix caused by the growth of premium-priced, profit-accretive products that have lower than segment-average gross margins, partially offset by increased pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales declined due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase and a reduction in marketing spending.BABY, FEMININE & FAMILY CARE($ millions)20222021Change vs. 2021VolumeN/AN/A1%Net sales$19,736$18,8505%Net earnings$3,266$3,629(10)%% of net sales16.5%19.3%(280) bpsBaby, Feminine & Family Care net sales increased 5% to $19.7 billion in fiscal 2022 on a 1% increase in unit volume. Higher pricing increased net sales by 4%. Favorable mix increased net sales by 1% due to the disproportionate growth in North America and growth of premium tier products, both of which have higher than segment-average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange decreased net sales by 1%. Organic sales increased 6%. Global market share of the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment increased 0.8 points. •Baby Care net sales increased mid-single digits on unit volume that was unchanged. Positive impacts of increased pricing and favorable mix (due to a higher proportion of sales in North America and the growth of premium pants and taped diaper products, all of which have higher than category-average selling prices) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales increased high single digits. Volume increased high single digits in Latin America (due to innovation) and increased low single digits in North America (due to market growth and better on-shelf availability versus competitors), Europe (due to market growth) and IMEA (due to market growth versus a prior year impacted by pandemic-related contraction). This increase was fully offset by a mid-teens decline in Greater China (due to competitive activity) and a mid-single digit decline in Asia Pacific (due to market decline). Global market share of the baby care category increased nearly half a point.•Feminine Care net sales increased high single digits. Positive impacts of a low single digit increase in volume, increased pricing and positive mix (due to a higher proportion of sales in North America and the growth of premium products, including adult incontinence, both of which have higher than category-average selling prices) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales increased double digits. The volume increase was driven by a high single digit increase in North America (due to innovation, distribution gains and market growth) partially offset by a low single digit decrease in IMEA (due to market decline). Market share of the feminine care category increased more than a point.24 The Procter & Gamble Company•Net sales in Family Care, which is predominantly a North American business, increased low single digits. Positive impacts of a low single digit increase in volume (due to increased promotional activity and innovation) and increased pricing were partially offset by increased promotional spending (versus the prior year with low promotional activity due to the pandemic) and unfavorable mix (due to disproportionate growth in the club channel, which have lower than category-average selling prices). Organic sales also increased low single digits. North America's share of the family care category increased nearly a point.Net earnings in fiscal 2022 decreased 10% to $3.3 billion as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 280 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased primarily due to a decrease in gross margin, partially offset by lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin decreased primarily due to an increase in commodity and transportation costs partially offset by increased pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase and reductions in both marketing and overhead costs.CORPORATE($ millions)20222021Change vs. 2021Net sales$744$44169%Net earnings/(loss)$485$(387)N/ACorporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include but are not limited to incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, gains and losses related to certain divested brands or businesses, impacts from various financing and investing activities and other impacts related to employee benefits, asset impairments and restructuring activities including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used within the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most notable ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, which adjusts the blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate.Corporate net sales increased 69% to $744 million in fiscal 2022 due to an increase in the net sales of the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings improved by $872 million to $485 million in fiscal 2022 due primarily to the prior year loss on the early debt extinguishment, a current year gain on the divestiture of a minor business, net sales growth, current year tax benefits (primarily higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation) and lower restructuring charges, partially offset by increased commodity costs tied to the aforementioned incidental businesses.Restructuring Program to Deliver Productivity and Cost SavingsThe Company has historically had an ongoing restructuring program with annual spending in the range of $250 to $500 million. Savings generated from the Company's restructuring program are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. In fiscal 2022, the Company incurred before tax restructuring costs within the range of our historical annual ongoing level of $250 to $500 million.Restructuring accruals of $147 million as of June 30, 2022, are classified as current liabilities. Approximately 65% of the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2022 either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting.In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins.CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates.Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.Cash Flow Analysis($ millions)20222021Net cash provided by operating activities$16,723 $18,371 Net cash provided/(used) by investing activities(4,424)(2,834)Net cash used in financing activities(14,876)(21,531)Adjusted Free Cash Flow13,792 15,809 Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity93 %107 %Operating Cash FlowOperating cash flow was $16.7 billion in 2022, a 9% decrease versus the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets) generated approximately $17.6 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts used $918 million of operating cash flow as summarized below.•An increase in accounts receivable used $694 million of cash primarily due to sales growth. The number of days The Procter & Gamble Company 25sales outstanding increased approximately 1 day versus prior year.•Higher inventory used $1.2 billion of cash, due to business growth and increased safety stock levels to strengthen supply chain sufficiency amidst business growth and commodity cost increases. Inventory days on hand increased approximately 1 day primarily due to these same factors. •Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities generated $1.4 billion of cash. Accounts payable increased in line with the increase in inventory and, to a lesser extent, the impact of extended payment terms with suppliers (see Extended Payment Terms and Supply Chain Financing below); partially offset by lower marketing spending. Days payable outstanding increased approximately 1 day versus prior year due to these same factors.•Other net operating assets and liabilities used $406 million of cash primarily driven by the current portion of transitional tax payments due related to the U.S. Tax Act and pension related contributions, partially offset by other impacts.Adjusted Free Cash Flow. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important non-GAAP measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation. Adjusted free cash flow was $13.8 billion in 2022, a decrease of 13% versus the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in operating cash flows as discussed above. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings was 93% in 2022. Extended Payment Terms and Supply Chain Financing. Beginning in fiscal 2014, in response to evolving market practices, the Company began a program to negotiate extended payment terms with its suppliers. At the same time, the Company initiated a Supply Chain Finance program (the ""SCF"") with a number of global financial institutions (the ""SCF Banks""). Under the SCF, qualifying suppliers may elect to sell their receivables from the Company to a SCF Bank. These participating suppliers negotiate their receivables sales arrangements directly with the respective SCF Bank. While the Company is not party to those agreements, the SCF Banks allow the participating suppliers to utilize the Company’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs. This generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. The Company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier elects to participate in the SCF and reaches an agreement with an SCF Bank, they elect which individual Company invoices they sell to the SCF bank. However, all the Company’s payments to participating suppliers are paid to the SCF Bank on the invoice due date, regardless of whether the individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the SCF Bank. The SCF Bank pays the supplier on the invoice due date for any invoices that were not previously sold to the SCF Bank under the SCF.The terms of the Company’s payment obligation are not impacted by a supplier’s participation in the SCF. Our payment terms with our suppliers for similar services and materials within individual markets are consistent between suppliers that elect to participate in the SCF and those that do not participate. Accordingly, our average days outstanding are not significantly impacted by the portion of suppliers or related input costs that are included in the SCF. In addition, the SCF is available to both material suppliers, where the underlying costs are largely included in Cost of goods sold, and to service suppliers, where the underlying costs are largely included in SG&A. As of June 30, 2022, approximately 3% of our global suppliers have elected to participate in the SCF. Payments to those suppliers during fiscal year 2022 total approximately $15 billion, which equals approximately 25% of our total Cost of goods sold and SG&A for the year. For participating suppliers, we believe substantially all of their receivables with the Company are sold to the SCF Banks. Accordingly, we would expect that at each balance sheet date, a similar proportion of amounts originally due to suppliers would instead be payable to SCF Banks. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in the SCF are recorded within Accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the amount due to suppliers participating in the SCF and included in Accounts payable were approximately $6 billion and $5 billion, respectively.Although difficult to project due to market and other dynamics, we anticipate incremental cash flow benefits from the extended payment terms with suppliers could increase at a slower rate in fiscal 2023. Future changes in our suppliers’ financing policies or economic developments, such as changes in interest rates, general market liquidity or the Company’s credit-worthiness relative to participating suppliers, could impact suppliers’ participation in the SCF and/or our ability to negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers. However, any such impacts are difficult to predict.Investing Cash FlowNet investing activities used $4.4 billion of cash in 2022, primarily due to capital spending and acquisitions. Net investing activities used $2.8 billion in cash in 2021, mainly due to capital spending. Capital Spending. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost efficiencies, were $3.2 billion in 2022 and $2.8 billion in 2021. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points to 3.9% in 2022. 26 The Procter & Gamble CompanyAcquisitions. Acquisition activity used cash of $1.4 billion in 2022, primarily related to Beauty acquisitions of Farmacy Beauty, Ouai and TULA. Acquisition activity used $34 million in 2021, primarily related to a minor Health Care acquisition. Proceeds from Divestitures and Other Asset Sales. Proceeds from asset sales were $110 million in 2022 and $42 million in 2021, primarily from fixed asset sales and minor brand divestitures. Investment Securities. Investments provided net cash of $3 million in 2022 primarily from the sale of other investments and used cash of $55 million in 2021 primarily from the purchase of investment securities. Financing Cash FlowNet financing activities consumed $14.9 billion of cash in 2022, mainly due to treasury stock purchases and dividends to shareholders, partially offset by a net debt increase and the impact of proceeds received from stock option exercises. Net financing activities consumed $21.5 billion in cash in 2021, mainly due to treasury stock purchases, dividends to shareholders and a net debt reduction, partially offset by the impact of stock options. Dividend Payments. Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments. Dividends per common share increased 9% to $3.5227 per share in 2022. Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $8.8 billion in 2022 and $8.3 billion in 2021. In April 2022, the Board of Directors declared a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.8698 to $0.9133 per share on Common Stock and Series A and B Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) Convertible Class A Preferred Stock. This is the 66th consecutive year that our dividend has increased. We have paid a dividend for 132 consecutive years, every year since our incorporation in 1890.Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $31.5 billion as of June 30, 2022, and $32.0 billion as of June 30, 2021. We generated $1.9 billion from net debt increases, primarily due to issuance of bonds. In 2021, we used $3.9 billion for net debt reductions, including $512 million for early debt extinguishment costs related to the early retirement of $2.3 billion of debt.Treasury Purchases. Total share repurchases were $10.0 billion in 2022 and $11.0 billion in 2021. Impact of Stock Options and Other. The exercise of stock options and other financing activities generated $2.0 billion and $1.6 billion of cash in 2022 and 2021, respectively. LiquidityAt June 30, 2022, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $11.4 billion, largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had $5.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents related to foreign subsidiaries, primarily in various Western European and Asian countries. We did not have material cash and cash equivalents related to any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds. Under current law, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future. We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled, and should continue to enable, us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient funding to meet short-term financing requirements.On June 30, 2022, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard & Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings were Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard & Poor's), all with a stable outlook.We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $8.0 billion facility split between a $3.2 billion five-year facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire in November 2026 and November 2022, respectively. Both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities. For additional details on debt, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.The Procter & Gamble Company 27Contractual CommitmentsThe following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2022.($ millions)TotalLess Than 1 Year1-3 Years3-5 YearsAfter 5 YearsRECORDED LIABILITIESTotal debt$31,925 $8,656 $4,190 $6,508 $12,571 Leases885 206 314 156 209 U.S. Tax Act transitional charge (1)1,886 225 983 678 — OTHERInterest payments relating to long-term debt4,8135689888682,389Minimum pension funding (2)493 160 333 — — Purchase obligations (3)2,7851,082826452425TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS$42,787 $10,897 $7,634 $8,662 $15,594 (1)Represents the U.S. federal tax liability associated with the repatriation provisions of the U.S. Tax Act. (2) Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2025 are not currently determinable.(3) Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent minimum commitments with suppliers and are in line with expected usage. This includes service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include revenue recognition, income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.The Company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.Revenue RecognitionOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, in-store merchandising funds, advertising and other promotional activities and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale. Amounts accrued for trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation, based on contractual terms, sales volumes and historical utilization and redemption rates. The actual amounts paid may be different from such estimates. These differences, which have historically not been significant, are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgements and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, and our ability to uphold certain tax positions.Realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective 28 The Procter & Gamble Companygovernmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.A core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model, such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities in the jurisdictions where those functions are performed. However, because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts, we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various cross-border transactions. We have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty. We estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70% of our global earnings. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have several audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Because there are several estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the Company's income taxes.Employee BenefitsWe sponsor various postretirement benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other postretirement benefit (OPRB) plans, consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPRB plans require assumptions to estimate the net projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and net obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPRB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2022, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPRB assets was 5.5% and 8.4%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPRB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit/expense by approximately $125 million.Since pension and OPRB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPRB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans of 3.7% represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $135 million. The average discount rate on the OPRB plan of 5.0% reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the U.S., which is where most of the plan participants receive benefits. A 100 basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax OPRB expense by approximately $10 million. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPRB plans.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsSignificant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations. We typically estimate the fair value of these assets using the income method, which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. The valuations used to establish and to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin progression, Company business plans and the discount rate applied to cash flows.Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized, but are tested at least annually for impairment. Our ongoing annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the 3 months ended December 31. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of The Procter & Gamble Company 29capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions. For example, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. In addition, changes to or a failure to achieve business plans or deterioration of macroeconomic conditions could result in reduced cash flows or higher discount rates, leading to a lower valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets of these businesses.We test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the book value of each asset to the estimated fair value. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. If the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment.Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, all customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. An impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed three times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high as our legacy businesses. The Appliances reporting unit has a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value. Based on our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Shave Care reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 30% and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5%. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates (including residual growth rates) and discount rate. The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans and approximates expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate is dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. Another key assumption in our fair value determination of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is the royalty rate, which is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins. While management can and has implemented strategies to address these events in the past, changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the Shave Care reporting unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.The duration and severity of the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine War could result in a slow-down or a recession or drive inflationary pressures or foreign currency devaluations in the general economy. These could trigger additional future impairment charges for the Shave Care reporting unit goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. While we have concluded that a triggering event did not occur during the quarter ended June 30, 2022, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is most susceptible to future impairment risk. Our assessment of the Gillette intangible asset assumes the net sales growth rates will continue to recover from the impact of the pandemic. There continues to be a high level of uncertainty relating to geopolitical and macroeconomic factors as a result of the Russia-Ukraine War and the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, there 30 The Procter & Gamble Companycontinues to be risk related to this key assumption. The continued evolution of the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine War could impact the assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset that are significant enough to trigger an impairment. Net sales and earnings growth rates could be negatively impacted by more prolonged reductions or changes in demand for our shave care products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, financial hardship, changes in the use and frequency of grooming products or by shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or by disruption in the supply chain or operations due to the evolving Russia-Ukraine War. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors including the Russia-Ukraine War could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries’ currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Finally, the discount rate utilized in our valuation model could be impacted by changes in the underlying interest rates and risk premiums included in the determination of the cost of capital. As of June 30, 2022, the carrying values of the Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were $12.3 billion and $14.1 billion, respectively. We performed a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset during our annual impairment testing, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorter-term and residual growth rates, the discount rate and the royalty rate to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis point decrease in our shorter-term and residual growth rates, or a 50 basis point decrease in our royalty rate, some of which would result in an impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. Approximate Percent Change in Estimated Fair Value+25 bps Discount Rate-25 bpsGrowth Rate-50 bps Royalty RateShave Care goodwill reporting unit(6)%(6)%N/AGillette indefinite-lived intangible asset(6)%(6)%(3)%In light of the Russia-Ukraine War, we performed an additional sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset for a range of outcomes, including reduced future cash flows and no future cash flows in Ukraine and Russia. Under these scenarios, the Shave Care reporting unit fair value continued to exceed its carrying value by approximately 30% and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset’s fair value exceeded or approximated its carrying value. However, if the impact of the war were to extend beyond its current scope, there could be a triggering event for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset that may cause us to perform an additional impairment assessment for that asset in a future period that may result in an impairment charge.See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing results.New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of June 30, 2022.OTHER INFORMATIONHedging and Derivative Financial InstrumentsAs a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. We leverage the Company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility within our financing operations, as discussed below, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments.Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the RiskManager™ value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics™ dataset as of June 30, 2022. In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics™, a reasonable proxy is included.Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term.Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge exposures to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on The Procter & Gamble Company 31our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments.Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the year ended June 30, 2022, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements.Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps with maturities of less than 18 months. Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the year ended June 30, 2022, we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact on such instruments of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements.Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures.As of and during the years ended June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2021, we did not have any financial commodity hedging activity. Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAPIn accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective of underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. These measures include:Organic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.The following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth:Year ended June 30, 2022Net Sales GrowthForeign Exchange ImpactAcquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other (1)Organic Sales GrowthBeauty2 %— %— %2 %Grooming2 %3 %— %5 %Health Care9 %1 %— %10 %Fabric & Home Care6 %2 %— %8 %Baby, Feminine & Family Care5 %1 %— %6 %TOTAL COMPANY5 %2 %— %7 %(1) Acquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other includes the volume and mix impact of acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales. Adjusted Free Cash Flow. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and transitional tax payments resulting from the U.S. Tax Act beginning in 2019. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow ($ millions):OperatingCash FlowCapitalSpendingAdjustments to Operating Cash Flow (1)Adjusted FreeCash Flow2022$16,723 $(3,156)$225 $13,792 2021$18,371 $(2,787)$225 $15,809 (1) Adjustments to Operating Cash Flow include transitional tax payments resulting from the U.S. Tax Act of $225 in 2022 and 2021.32 The Procter & Gamble CompanyAdjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the charges for early debt extinguishment (which are not considered part of our ongoing operations). We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent.The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow productivity ($ millions):Adjusted Free Cash FlowNetEarningsEarly Debt Extinguishment ChargesNet Earnings Excluding AdjustmentsAdjusted FreeCash FlowProductivity2022$13,792 $14,793 $— $14,793 93 %2021$15,809 $14,352 $427 $14,779 107 %Core EPS. Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. Core EPS is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The table below provides a reconciliation of diluted net earnings per share to Core EPS, including the following reconciling items:•Charges for early debt extinguishment: During fiscal year 2021 the Company recorded after tax charges of $427 million ($512 million before tax), due to the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt. These charges represent the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished.We do not view the above items to be indicative of underlying business results and its exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. This item is also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES(Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts)Reconciliation of Non-GAAP MeasuresTwelve Months Ended June 30, 2022Twelve Months Ended June 30, 2021AS REPORTED (GAAP)AS REPORTED (GAAP)EARLY DEBT EXTINGUISHMENTNON-GAAP (CORE)NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO P&G$14,742 $14,306 $427 $14,733 Core EPSDILUTED NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (1)$5.81 $5.50 $0.16 $5.66 (1) Diluted net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble.CHANGE IN CURRENT YEAR REPORTED (GAAP) VERSUS NON-GAAP (CORE)(1)CORE EPS3 %(1) Change versus year ago is calculated based on As Reported (GAAP) values for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, versus the Non-GAAP (Core) values for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021.Item 7A.

A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein is included in the section titled ""Economic Conditions and Uncertainties"" and the section titled ""Risk Factors"" (Part I, Item 1A) of this Form 10-K.Purpose, Approach and Non-GAAP MeasuresThe purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections:•Overview•Summary of 2023 Results •Economic Conditions and Uncertainties•Results of Operations•Segment Results•Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity•Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates•Other InformationThroughout the MD&A we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), consisting of organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. Organic sales growth is net sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Core EPS is diluted EPS excluding certain items that are not judged by management to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Adjusted free cash flow is operating cash flow less 14 The Procter & Gamble Companycapital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding certain one-time items. We believe these measures provide our investors with additional information about our underlying results and trends as well as insight to some of the metrics used to evaluate management. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides more details on the use and the derivation of these measures as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures quarter and fiscal year-to-date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. OVERVIEWProcter & Gamble is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in approximately 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to individual consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries.Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products, as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.Organizational StructureOur organizational structure is comprised of Sector Business Units (SBUs), Enterprise Markets (EMs), Corporate Functions (CF) and Global Business Services (GBS).Sector Business UnitsThe Company's ten product categories are organized into five SBUs and five reportable segments (under U.S. GAAP): Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric & Home Care; and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. The SBUs are responsible for global brand strategy, product upgrades and innovation, marketing plans and supply chain. They have direct profit responsibility for markets (referred to as Focus Markets) representing the large majority of the Company's sales and earnings and are also responsible for innovation plans, supply plans and operating frameworks to drive growth and value creation in the remaining markets (referred to as Enterprise Markets). Throughout the MD&A, we reference business results by region, which are comprised of North America, Europe, Greater China, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA).

North America market shares are over 40% for Bounty and over 25% for Charmin.16 The Procter & Gamble CompanyEnterprise MarketsEnterprise Markets are responsible for sales and profit delivery in specific countries, supported by SBU-agreed innovation and supply chain plans, along with scaled services like planning, distribution and customer management.Corporate FunctionsCorporate Functions provides company-level strategy and portfolio analysis, corporate accounting, treasury, tax, external relations, governance, human resources, information technology and legal services.Global Business ServicesGlobal Business Services provides scaled services in technology, process and data tools to enable the SBUs, the EMs and CF to better serve consumers and customers. The GBS organization is responsible for providing world-class services and solutions that drive value for P&G.Strategic FocusProcter & Gamble aspires to serve the world’s consumers better than our best competitors in every category and in every country in which we compete and, as a result, deliver total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group. Delivering and sustaining leadership levels of shareholder value creation requires balanced top- and bottom-line growth and strong cash generation.The Company competes in daily-use product categories where performance plays a significant role in the consumer's choice of brands, and therefore, play to P&G's strengths. Our focused portfolio of businesses consists of ten product categories where P&G has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies.Within these categories, our strategic choices are focused on delighting and winning with consumers. Our consumers are at the center of everything we do. We win with consumers by delivering irresistible superiority across five key vectors - product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value. Winning with consumers around the world and against our best competitors requires superior innovation. Innovation has always been, and continues to be, P&G’s lifeblood. Superior products delivered with superior execution drive market growth, value creation for retailers and build share growth for P&G.Ongoing productivity improvement is crucial to delivering our balanced top- and bottom-line growth, cash generation and value creation objectives. Productivity improvement enables investments to strengthen the superiority of our brands via product and packaging innovation, more efficient and effective supply chains, equity and awareness-building brand advertising and other programs and expansion of sales coverage and R&D programs. Productivity improvements also enable us to mitigate challenging cost environments (including periods of increasing commodity and negative foreign exchange impacts). Our objective is to drive productivity improvements across all elements of the statement of earnings and balance sheet, including cost of goods sold, marketing and promotional spending, overhead costs and capital spending. We act with agility and are constructively disrupting our highly competitive industry and the way we do business, including how we innovate, communicate and leverage new technologies, to create more value.We are improving operational effectiveness and organizational culture through enhanced clarity of roles and responsibilities, accountability and incentive compensation programs.Additionally, within this strategy of superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization, we have declared four focus areas to strengthen our performance going forward. These are 1) leveraging environmental sustainability as an additional driver of superior performing products and packaging innovations, 2) increasing digital acumen to drive consumer and customer preference, reduce cost and enable rapid and efficient decision making, 3) developing next-level supply chain capabilities to enable flexibility, agility, resilience and a new level of productivity and 4) delivering employee value equation for all gender identities, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities for all roles to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent.We believe this strategy is right for the long-term health of the Company and our objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group.The Company expects the delivery of the following long-term growth algorithm will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive, fast-moving consumer goods peer group:•Organic sales growth above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete;•Core EPS growth of mid-to-high single digits; and•Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater.While periods of significant macroeconomic pressures may cause short-term results to deviate from the long-term growth algorithm, we intend to maintain a disciplined approach to investing in our business.The Procter & Gamble Company 17SUMMARY OF 2023 RESULTSAmounts in millions, except per share amounts20232022Change vs. Prior YearNet sales$82,006 $80,187 2 %Operating income18,134 17,813 2 %Net earnings14,738 14,793 — %Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble14,653 14,742 (1)%Diluted net earnings per common share5.90 5.81 2 %Core earnings per share5.90 5.81 2 %Cash flow from operating activities16,848 16,723 1 %•Net sales increased 2% to $82.0 billion versus the prior year. The net sales growth was driven by a mid-single-digit increase in Health Care, low single-digit increases in Fabric & Home Care, Baby, Feminine & Family Care and Beauty, partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in Grooming. Organic sales, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 7%. Organic sales increased high single digits in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care and mid-single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care, Beauty and Grooming.•Operating income increased $321 million, or 2%, to $18.1 billion versus year ago due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by a modest decrease in operating margin.•Net earnings decreased modestly by $55 million to $14.7 billion versus year ago as the increase in operating income was more than fully offset by a higher effective tax rate. Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $1.4 billion. •Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased $89 million, or 1%, to $14.7 billion versus the prior year due primarily to the decrease in net earnings.•Diluted EPS increased 2% to $5.90 as the decrease in net earnings was more than offset by a reduction in shares outstanding. •Cash flow from operating activities was $16.8 billion.◦ Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures and certain other impacts, was $14.0 billion.◦ Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings, was 95%.ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIESWe discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives, in annual and quarterly reports, press releases and other written and oral communications. All such statements, except for historical and present factual information, are ""forward-looking statements"" and are based on financial data and our business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become out-of-date or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors, except as required by law. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and investors must recognize that events could be significantly different from our expectations. For more information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.Global Economic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia, Australia and Africa, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. Our largest international markets are Greater China, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Germany and collectively comprise more than 20% of our net sales in fiscal 2023. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. We are also exposed to market risks from operating in challenging environments including unstable economic, political and social conditions, civil unrest, natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations. These risks can reduce our net sales or erode our operating margins and consequently reduce our net earnings and cash flows.Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation costs, other broader inflationary impacts and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of these commodities and input materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations due to energy shortages, natural disasters, labor or freight constraints have impacted our costs and could do so in the future. New or increased legal or regulatory requirements, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, could also result in increased costs due to higher material costs and investments in facilities and equipment. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response to certain inflationary or cost increases may also offset portions of the cost impacts; however, such price increases may impact product consumption. If we are unable to manage cost impacts through pricing actions and consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.18 The Procter & Gamble CompanyForeign Exchange. We have significant translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In the past three years, weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar has resulted in significant foreign exchange impacts leading to lower net sales, net earnings and cash flows. Certain countries that recently had and are currently experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations include Argentina, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Japan, Russia and Turkey. These fluctuations have significantly impacted our historical net sales, net earnings and cash flows and could do so in the future. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on the consumption of our products, which would negatively affect our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.Government Policies. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies. For example, our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, including changes resulting from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on ""Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy."" The breadth of the OECD project extends beyond pure digital businesses and, as proposed, is likely to impact most large multinational businesses by both redefining jurisdictional taxation rights and establishing a 15% global minimum tax. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and climate change matters. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Egypt, Argentina and Pakistan. Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere. Changes in government policies in the above areas might cause an increase or decrease in our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.Russia-Ukraine War. The war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted our operations. Our Ukraine business includes two manufacturing sites and accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales and consolidated net earnings in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. Net assets of our Ukraine business accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net assets as of June 30, 2023. Our Russia business includes two manufacturing sites. Beginning in March 2022, the Company reduced its product portfolio, discontinued new capital investments and suspended media, advertising and promotional activity in Russia. The Russia business accounted for approximately 2% of consolidated net sales and consolidated net earnings in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. Net assets of our Russia business accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net assets as of June 30, 2023. Future impacts to the Company are difficult to predict due to the high level of uncertainty related to the war's duration, evolution and ultimate resolution. Within Ukraine, there is a possibility of physical damage and destruction of our two manufacturing facilities. We may not be able to operate our manufacturing sites and source raw materials from our suppliers or ship finished products to our customers. Within Russia, we may not be able to continue our reduced operations at current levels due to sanctions and counter-sanctions, monetary, currency or payment controls, legislative restrictions or policies, restrictions on access to financial institutions and supply and transportation challenges. Our suppliers, distributors and retail customers are also impacted by the war and their ability to successfully maintain their operations could also impact our operations or negatively impact the sales of our products. More broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales, earnings and cash flows should the situation escalate beyond its current scope, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures and supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of Europe. For additional information on risk factors that could impact our business results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe key metrics included in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations include net sales, gross margin, selling, general and administrative costs (SG&A), operating margin, other non-operating items, income taxes and net earnings. The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of initiatives, pricing and other activities by competitors), marketing spending, retail executions (both in-store and online) and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as our pricing actions (which can also impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign exchange impacts on sales outside the U.S.For most of our categories, our cost of products sold and SG&A are variable in nature to some extent. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in North America are generally higher than the Company average for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign The Procter & Gamble Company 19exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for example, product or package improvements) and, to a lesser extent, scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary components of SG&A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. While overhead costs are variable to some extent, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems' infrastructures to support business growth. The main drivers of changes in SG&A as a percentage of net sales are overhead and marketing cost savings, reinvestments (for example, increased advertising), inflation, foreign exchange fluctuations and scale impacts.For a detailed discussion of the fiscal 2022 year-over-year changes, please refer to the MD&A in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.Net SalesNet sales increased 2% to $82.0 billion in fiscal 2023. The increase in net sales was driven by higher pricing of 9% and a favorable mix of 1%, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 5% and a 3% decrease in unit volume versus the prior year. Favorable mix was driven by a higher proportion of sales in North America (with higher than Company-average selling prices) and decline in Europe (with lower than Company-average selling prices). Excluding the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, organic sales grew 7%. Net sales increased mid-single digits in Health Care, increased low single digits in Fabric & Home Care, Baby, Feminine & Family Care and Beauty and decreased low single digits in Grooming. On a regional basis, volume decreased double digits in Europe, mid-single digits in Greater China and low single digits in Asia Pacific, IMEA and North America. Volume increased low single digits in Latin America.

The increase in gross margin was due to:•a 430 basis-point increase from higher pricing and•a 150 basis-point increase from manufacturing productivity savings.These increases were partially offset by •320 basis points of increased commodity and input material costs,•a 110 basis-point decline from unfavorable mix due to the launch and growth of premium products (which have lower than Company-average gross margins) and the disproportionate decline of the super-premium SK-II brand,•a 50 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts,•30 basis points due to capacity start-up costs and other manufacturing impacts and•20 basis points of product and packaging investments.Total SG&A increased 4% to $21.1 billion due primarily to an increase in overhead costs and other net operating costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 50 basis points to 25.7% due to an increase in overhead and other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a decrease in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. •Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and increased productivity savings, partially offset by increased media reinvestments.•Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 40 basis points due to wage inflation and other cost increases, partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings.•Other net operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points due primarily to higher foreign exchange transactional charges.Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 90 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales.Operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 22.1% as the increase in gross margin was more than fully offset by the increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales as discussed above.20 The Procter & Gamble CompanyNon-Operating Items•Interest expense was $756 million, an increase of $317 million versus the prior year due to higher interest rates and an increase in short-term debt in the current year.•Interest income was $307 million, an increase of $256 million versus the prior year due to higher interest rates.•Other non-operating income increased $98 million to $668 million due primarily to a prior year unrealized loss on equity investments and a current year gain on divestiture of minor brands. Income TaxesThe effective tax rate increased 190 basis points versus the prior year period to 19.7% due to:•a 100 basis-point increase from lower excess tax benefits of share-based compensation,•a 50 basis-point increase from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions and•a 40 basis-point increase primarily from lower current year deductions for foreign-derived intangible income versus prior year.Net EarningsOperating income increased $321 million, or 2%, to $18.1 billion due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by a modest decrease in operating margin, both of which are discussed above. Earnings before income taxes increased $358 million, or 2%, to $18.4 billion due primarily to the increase in operating income. Net earnings declined modestly by $55 million to $14.7 billion due to the increase in earnings before income taxes, more than fully offset by the increase in the effective income tax rate discussed above. Foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $1.4 billion due to a weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar. This impact includes both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars.Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased $89 million, or 1%, to $14.7 billion. Diluted EPS increased $0.09, or 2%, to $5.90 as the decrease in net earnings was more than fully offset by a reduction in shares outstanding.

Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used within the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most notable ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, which adjusts the blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate.Corporate net sales increased 3% to $765 million due to an increase in net sales of the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings decreased $884 million to a loss of $399 million primarily due to higher interest expense, lower excess tax benefits of share-based compensation and higher foreign exchange transactional charges, partially offset by the increase in net sales of the incidental businesses and higher interest income.Restructuring Program to Deliver Productivity and Cost SavingsThe Company has historically had an ongoing restructuring program with annual spending in the range of $250 to $500 million. Savings generated from the Company's restructuring program are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. In fiscal 2023, the Company incurred before tax restructuring costs within the range of our historical annual ongoing level of $250 to $500 million.24 The Procter & Gamble CompanyRestructuring accruals of $174 million as of June 30, 2023, are classified as current liabilities. Approximately 87% of the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2023 either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting.In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins.CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITYWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates.Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities. The overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.Cash Flow Analysis($ millions)20232022Net cash provided by operating activities$16,848 $16,723 Net cash used in investing activities(3,500)(4,424)Net cash used in financing activities(12,146)(14,876)Adjusted Free Cash Flow14,011 13,792 Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity95 %93 %Operating Cash FlowOperating cash flow was $16.8 billion in 2023, a 1% increase versus the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets) generated approximately $17.5 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts used $656 million of operating cash flow as summarized below.•An increase in Accounts receivable used $307 million of cash primarily due to sales growth. The number of days sales outstanding increased approximately 1 day versus prior year.•Higher inventory used $119 million of cash due to increased safety stock levels to strengthen supply chain sufficiency. Inventory days on hand was flat versus year ago. •Accounts payable and Accrued and other liabilities provided $313 million of cash, primarily driven by increases in taxes payable and accrued compensation expense, partially offset by a reduction in trade payables. The reduction in trade payables was due to lower supply chain payables from a decrease in commodity and transportation costs, partially offset by the impact of extended payment terms with suppliers (see Extended Payment Terms and Supply Chain Financing below). Days payable outstanding decreased approximately 3 days versus prior year.•Other net operating assets and liabilities used $543 million of cash primarily driven by pension-related contributions.Adjusted Free Cash Flow. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important non-GAAP measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation. Adjusted free cash flow was $14.0 billion in 2023, an increase of 2% versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in operating cash flows as discussed above. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings, was 95% in 2023. Extended Payment Terms and Supply Chain Financing. Beginning in fiscal 2014, in response to evolving market practices, the Company began a program to negotiate extended payment terms with its suppliers. At the same time, the Company initiated a Supply Chain Finance program (the ""SCF"") with a number of global financial institutions (the ""SCF Banks""). Under the SCF, qualifying suppliers may elect to sell their receivables from the Company to an SCF Bank. These participating suppliers negotiate their receivables sales arrangements directly with the respective SCF Bank. While the Company is not party to those agreements, the SCF Banks allow the participating suppliers to utilize the Company’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs. This generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. The Company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier elects to participate in the SCF and reaches an agreement with an SCF Bank, they elect which individual Company invoices they sell to the SCF bank. However, all the Company’s payments to participating suppliers are paid to the SCF Bank on the invoice due date, regardless of whether the individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the SCF Bank. The SCF Bank pays the supplier on the invoice due date for any invoices that were not previously sold to the SCF Bank under the SCF.The Procter & Gamble Company 25The terms of the Company’s payment obligation are not impacted by a supplier’s participation in the SCF. Our payment terms with our suppliers for similar services and materials within individual markets are consistent between suppliers that elect to participate in the SCF and those that do not participate. Accordingly, our average days outstanding are not significantly impacted by the portion of suppliers or related input costs that are included in the SCF. In addition, the SCF is available to both material suppliers, where the underlying costs are largely included in Cost of goods sold, and to service suppliers, where the underlying costs are largely included in SG&A. As of June 30, 2023, approximately 3% of our global suppliers have elected to participate in the SCF. Payments to those suppliers during fiscal year 2023 were approximately $18 billion, which equals approximately 29% of our total Cost of goods sold and SG&A for the year. For participating suppliers, we believe substantially all of their receivables with the Company are sold to the SCF Banks. Accordingly, we would expect that at each balance sheet date, a similar proportion of amounts originally due to suppliers would instead be payable to SCF Banks. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in the SCF are recorded within Accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the amounts due to suppliers participating in the SCF and included in Accounts payable were approximately $6 billion.Although difficult to project due to market and other dynamics, we anticipate incremental cash flow benefits from the extended payment terms with suppliers could increase at a slower rate in fiscal 2024. Future changes in our suppliers’ financing policies or economic developments, such as changes in interest rates, general market liquidity or the Company’s credit-worthiness relative to participating suppliers, could impact suppliers’ participation in the SCF and/or our ability to negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers. However, any such impacts are difficult to predict.Investing Cash FlowNet investing activities used $3.5 billion of cash in 2023, primarily due to capital spending and acquisitions. Capital Spending. Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation and cost efficiencies, were $3.1 billion in 2023. Capital spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points to 3.7% in 2023. Acquisitions. Acquisition activity used cash of $765 million in 2023, primarily related to a Beauty acquisition.Financing Cash FlowNet financing activities consumed $12.1 billion of cash in 2023, mainly due to dividends to shareholders and treasury stock purchases, partially offset by a net debt increase and the impact of stock options and other.Dividend Payments. Our first discretionary use of cash is dividend payments. Dividends per common share increased 4% to $3.6806 per share in 2023. Total dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders were $9.0 billion in 2023. In April 2023, the Board of Directors declared a 3% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.9133 to $0.9407 per share on Common Stock and Series A and B Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) Convertible Class A Preferred Stock. This is the 67th consecutive year that our dividend has increased. We have paid a dividend for 133 consecutive years, every year since our incorporation in 1890.Long-Term and Short-Term Debt. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and the overall cost of capital. Total debt was $34.6 billion as of June 30, 2023. We generated $2.9 billion from net debt issuances in short-term debt and long-term debt markets.Treasury Purchases. Total share repurchases were $7.4 billion in 2023. Impact of Stock Options and Other. The exercise of stock options and other financing activities generated $1.3 billion of cash in 2023. LiquidityAt June 30, 2023, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $13.1 billion, largely due to short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had $5.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents related to foreign subsidiaries, primarily in various European and Asian countries. We did not have material cash and cash equivalents related to any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds. Under current law, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future. We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient funding to meet short-term financing requirements.On June 30, 2023, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard & Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings were Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard & Poor's), all with a stable outlook.We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $8.0 billion facility split between a $3.2 billion five-year facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire in November 2027 and 26 The Procter & Gamble CompanyNovember 2023, respectively. Both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or long-term debt securities. For additional details on debt, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.Contractual CommitmentsThe following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitments as of June 30, 2023.($ millions)TotalLess Than 1 Year1-3 Years3-5 YearsAfter 5 YearsRECORDED LIABILITIESTotal debt$35,248 $10,316 $5,328 $5,899 $13,705 Leases911 222 322 171 196 U.S. Tax Act transitional charge (1)1,575 421 1,154 — — OTHERInterest payments relating to long-term debt5,727 713 1,245 946 2,823 Minimum pension funding (2)591 192 399 — — Purchase obligations (3)2,989 1,169 976 482 362 TOTAL CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS$47,041 $13,033 $9,424 $7,498 $17,086 (1)Represents the U.S. federal tax liability associated with the repatriation provisions of the U.S. Tax Act. (2)Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2026 are not currently determinable.(3)Primarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent minimum commitments with suppliers and are in line with expected usage. This includes service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include revenue recognition, income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.The Company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.Revenue RecognitionOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, in-store merchandising funds, advertising and other promotional activities and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale. Amounts accrued for trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation, based on contractual terms, sales volumes and historical utilization and redemption rates. The actual amounts paid may be different from such estimates. These differences, which have historically not been significant, are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period.Income TaxesOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgements and The Procter & Gamble Company 27assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, and our ability to uphold certain tax positions.Realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.A core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model, such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities in the jurisdictions where those functions are performed. However, because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts, we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various cross-border transactions. We have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty. We estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70% of our global earnings. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have several audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Because there are several estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on the Company's income taxes.Employee BenefitsWe sponsor various postretirement benefits throughout the world. These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other postretirement benefit (OPRB) plans consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPRB plans require assumptions to estimate the net projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and net obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPRB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2023, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPRB assets was 5.9% and 8.4%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPRB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit/expense by approximately $135 million.Since pension and OPRB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPRB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans of 4.2% represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100 basis-point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $130 million. The average discount rate on the OPRB plan of 5.6% reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the U.S., which is where most of the plan participants receive benefits. A 100 basis-point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax OPRB expense by approximately $30 million. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPRB plans.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsSignificant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable 28 The Procter & Gamble Companyuseful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. An impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Most of our goodwill reporting units have fair value cushions that significantly exceed their underlying carrying values. In connection with the Grooming operating segment integration as described further in Note 2, we concluded that the Shave Care and Appliances categories now operate as one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. Based on our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2022, our Grooming reporting unit goodwill has a fair value cushion of over 30%. As of June 30, 2023, the carrying value of the Grooming reporting unit goodwill was $12.7 billion.Most of our indefinite-lived intangible assets have fair value cushions that significantly exceed their underlying carrying value. Based on our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5%. As of June 30, 2023, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was $14.1 billion. While we have concluded that no triggering event has occurred during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is most susceptible to future impairment risk. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment, including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, market contraction from an economic recession and the Russia-Ukraine War, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger a future impairment charge. Further reduction of the Gillette business activities in Russia could reduce the estimated fair value by up to 5%. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rates. Net sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our Gillette products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors, including the Russia-Ukraine War, could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries’ currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the Gillette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and approximates expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rates depend on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rates could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. The royalty rates are driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins. We performed a sensitivity analysis for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset as part of our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2022, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the discount rate, the short-term and residual growth rates and the royalty rates to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our shorter-term and residual growth rates, or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rates, which may result in an impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.

We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. We leverage the Company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility within our financing operations, as discussed below, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments.Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including market valuation, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk modeling. The tests for interest rate, currency rate and commodity derivative positions discussed below are based on the RiskManager™ value-at-risk model using a one-year horizon and a 95% confidence level. The model incorporates the impact of correlation (the degree to which exposures move together over time) and diversification (from holding multiple currency, commodity and interest rate instruments) and assumes that financial returns are normally distributed. Estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the RiskMetrics™ dataset as of June 30, 2023. In cases where data is unavailable in RiskMetrics™, a reasonable proxy is included.Our market risk exposures relative to interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, as discussed below, have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly impact such exposures in the near term.Interest Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to manage exposures to interest rates on underlying debt obligations. Certain interest rate swaps denominated in foreign currencies are designated to hedge exposures to currency exchange rate movements on our investments in foreign operations. These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments.Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements.Currency Rate Exposure on Financial Instruments. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expenses of movements in currency exchange rates. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps with maturities of less than 18 months. Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact on such instruments of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements.Commodity Price Exposure on Financial Instruments. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we did not have any financial commodity hedging activity. Measures Not Defined By U.S. GAAPIn accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors, as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. These measures include:Organic Sales Growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a 30 The Procter & Gamble Companysupplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.The following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth:Fiscal year ended June 30, 2023Net Sales GrowthForeign Exchange ImpactAcquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other (1)Organic Sales GrowthBeauty2 %5 %(1)%6 %Grooming(3)%7 %1 %5 %Health Care4 %4 %— %8 %Fabric & Home Care3 %5 %— %8 %Baby, Feminine & Family Care2 %4 %— %6 %TOTAL COMPANY2 %5 %— %7 %(1)Acquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other includes the volume and mix impact of acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales.Adjusted Free Cash Flow. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow ($ millions):Operating Cash Flow Capital SpendingAdjustments to Operating Cash Flow (1)Adjusted Free Cash Flow2023$16,848 $(3,062)$225 $14,011 2022$16,723 $(3,156)$225 $13,792 (1)Adjustments to Operating Cash Flow include transitional tax payments resulting from the U.S. Tax Act of $225 in 2023 and 2022.Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow productivity ($ millions):Adjusted FreeCash FlowNet EarningsAdjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity2023$14,011 $14,738 95 %2022$13,792 $14,793 93 %Core EPS. Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted EPS excluding items that are not judged by management to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, there were no adjustments to or reconciling items for diluted EPS.Item 7A.

Among the key factors necessary to achieve the Company’s goals are: (1) the successful integration of the Company’s new organization structure, including achievement of expected cost and tax savings; (2) the ability to achieve business plans, including growing volume profitably, despite high levels of competitive activity, especially with respect to the product categories and geographical markets in which the Company has chosen to focus; (3) the ability to maintain key customer relationships; (4) the achievement of growth in significant developing markets such as China, Turkey, Mexico, the Southern Cone of Latin America, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the countries of Southeast Asia; (5) the ability to successfully manage regulatory, tax and legal matters, including resolution of pending matters within current estimates; (6) the successful and timely execution of planned brand divestitures; (7) the ability to successfully implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans in manufacturing and overhead areas; (8) the ability to successfully manage currency (including currency issues in Latin America), interest rate and certain commodity cost exposures; and (9) the ability to manage the continued political and/or economic uncertainty in Latin America and the Middle East, as well as any political and/or economic uncertainty due to terrorist activities. If the Company’s assumptions and estimates are incorrect or do not come to fruition, or if the Company does not achieve all of these key factors, then the Company’s actual performance could vary materially from the forward-looking statements made herein. 8 Table of Contents Item 7A.
