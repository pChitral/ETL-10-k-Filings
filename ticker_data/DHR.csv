313616,DHR,DANAHER CORP /DE/,2013,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For a discussion of risks related to our non-U.S. operations and foreign currency exchange, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”Major CustomersNo customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated sales in 2012, 2011 or 2010.Available InformationWe maintain an internet website at www.danaher.com. We make available free of charge on the website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material with, or furnishing such material to, the SEC. Our Internet site and the information contained on or connected to that site are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.16Table of ContentsITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Conditions in the global economy, the markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our business is sensitive to general economic conditions, both inside and outside the United States. Slower global economic growth, credit market crisis, high levels of unemployment, reduced levels of capital expenditures, government deficit reduction, sequestration and other austerity measures and other challenges affecting the global economy adversely affect the Company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, including having the effect of:•reducing demand for our products and services, limiting the financing available to our customers, increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies;•increasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories;•increasing price competition in our served markets; •resulting in supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; •increasing the risk of impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets; and•increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which, in addition to increasing the risks identified above, could result in preference actions against us.In particular, the European debt crisis, the instability and uncertainty relating to the Euro and generally weak economic conditions in Europe have constrained government budgets, limited the financing available to our suppliers and customers and adversely affected demand for our products, the availability of supplies and the value of our Euro-denominated assets and obligations.In addition, although we have been able to continue accessing the commercial paper markets through the date of this report, there can be no assurances that the commercial paper markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations.If slower growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve continues for a significant period, if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy don't benefit the markets we serve, our business and financial statements could be adversely affected. Our restructuring actions could have long-term adverse effects on our business. In 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012, we implemented significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. These restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities (including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses) reduce our available talent, assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and technologies, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases. These circumstances could adversely impact our business and financial statements.Our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve, and visibility into our markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth 17Table of Contentsin our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, in certain of our businesses product demand depends on customers' capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies, and matters of public policy as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities. Our product demand is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in incentive programs, new product introductions and customer inventory levels. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period.We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share. Even if we compete effectively, we may be required to reduce prices for our products. Our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. Because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors; please see “Item 1. Business - Competition” for additional details. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrate new markets, including in developing countries. Our failure to compete effectively and/or pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements.Our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation.We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop innovative new products and product enhancements on a timely basis, our products will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer. Our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to:•correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;•allocate our research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects;•anticipate and respond to our competitors' development of new products and technological innovations;•differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings and avoid product commoditization;•innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets;•obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies before our competitors do;•successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time;•obtain necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope, including with respect to medical device products by demonstrating satisfactory clinical results where applicable; and•convince customers to adopt new technologies.In addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. In addition, promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement.Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper 18Table of Contentspayments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees.Any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price.We may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price. Promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including high valuations, competition among prospective buyers, the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms. In addition, competition for acquisitions in our current and anticipated business areas is significant and may result in higher purchase prices. Changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions. Our ability to grow revenues, earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies. Our acquisition of businesses, including our acquisition of Beckman Coulter, could negatively impact our financial statements.As part of our business strategy we acquire businesses and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course, some of which may be material; please see “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) for additional details. In particular, as of the date of this report the acquisition of Beckman Coulter, Inc. in June 2011 was Danaher's largest acquisition and has expanded Danaher's business into new markets. Our acquisitions involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal and other risks and challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our financial statements: •Any acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it, or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable.•We may incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions.•Acquisitions could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in any given period, or over the long-term.•Pre-closing and post-closing acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period to period.•Acquisitions could create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address.•We could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other systems and retaining key employees and customers.•We may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition.•We may assume by acquisition unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company's activities. The realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations.•In connection with acquisitions, we often enter into post-closing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments, earn-out obligations and indemnification obligations, which may have unpredictable financial results.•As a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet. If we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets. 19Table of ContentsThe indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements.Divestitures could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements. We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. Divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business. For example, when we decide to sell a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms and within our anticipated timeframe, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not become satisfied. In addition, divestitures may dilute the Company's earnings per share, have other adverse accounting impacts and distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. In addition, we have retained responsibility for and/or have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.Certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and by comparable agencies of other countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information. Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements.Certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the FDA, by comparable agencies of other countries and regions and by regulations governing radioactive or other hazardous materials (or the manufacture and sale of products containing such materials). For more information regarding these regulations please see “Item 1 - Business - Regulatory Matters.” We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance (such as 510(k) clearance) for our new products or modifications to (or additional indications or uses of) existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and if we do obtain such clearance it may be time-consuming, costly and subject to restrictions. Our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances will depend on many factors, including our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results, and the process for obtaining such clearances could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained. Failure to obtain such regulatory clearances before marketing our products (or before implementing modifications to or additional indications or uses of our products), other violations of these regulations, efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products (even after obtaining clearance for distribution) and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to FDA Form 483 Inspectional Observations, warning letters, notices to customers, declining sales, loss of customers, loss of market share, recalls, seizures of adulterated or misbranded products, injunctions, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, narrowing of permitted uses for a product, suspension or withdrawal of approvals and pre-market notification rescissions. We are also subject to various laws regulating (1) fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, and (2) the privacy and security of health information, including the federal regulations described in “Item 1 - Business - Regulatory Matters.” Many states and foreign countries have also adopted laws and regulations similar to, and in some cases more stringent than, such federal regulations. For more information regarding these regulations please see “Item 1 - Business - Regulatory Matters.” Failure to comply with the regulations described above could result in the adverse effects referenced below under “Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation.” Compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses. The healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, which could adversely affect our financial statements.The healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, including the following:•Many of our customers, and the end-users to whom our customers supply products, rely on government funding of and reimbursement for healthcare products and services and research activities. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “PPACA”), healthcare austerity measures in Europe and other potential healthcare reform changes and government austerity 20Table of Contentsmeasures may reduce the amount of government funding or reimbursement available to customers or end-users of our products and services. Global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement.•Beginning in 2013, the PPACA imposes a 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States as well as new reporting and disclosure requirements on medical device manufacturers.•Governmental and private healthcare providers and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the delivery of healthcare services, forming group purchasing organizations to improve their purchasing leverage and using competitive bid processes to procure healthcare products and services.These changes may cause participants in the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services, reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products services from governmental agencies or third-party payors, reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services, increase our tax liabilities and increase our compliance and other costs. In addition, we may be unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us, and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability. All of the factors described above could adversely affect our financial statements.Our operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation.Our operations, products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use, generation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the United States and abroad in connection with our operations. We cannot assure you that our environmental, health and safety compliance program has been or will at all times be effective. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements. In addition, we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. We may also become subject to additional remedial, compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules. For additional information regarding these risks, please refer to “Item 1. Business - Regulatory Matters.” We cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. However, based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2012 will have a material effect on our financial statements.Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation.In addition to the anticorruption, environmental, health, safety, healthcare and medical device-related regulations noted above, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the federal, state and local levels, including the following:•We are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons and dealings between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory.21Table of Contents•We also have agreements to sell products and services to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. Our agreements with government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification at the convenience of the government or in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors, and we may underestimate our costs of performing under the contract. Government contracts that have been awarded to us following a bid process could become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder, which could result in loss of the contract. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts. These are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. Failure to comply with these or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to manufacture, import, export and sell products and services, disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies, damage to our reputation and loss of customers and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. Compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses. Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the ISO, and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our financial statements. For additional information regarding these risks, please refer to “Item 1. Business - Regulatory Matters.”We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.As of December 31, 2012, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $21.8 billion. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized. Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements.Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products and services purchased overseas. Sales and expenses of our non-U.S. businesses are also translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects. In addition, certain of our businesses may invoice customers in a currency other than the business' functional currency, and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable translation effects. The Company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries.Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Please see the MD&A for a discussion of the factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period. The impact of these factors may be substantially different from period to period. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. Due to the potential for changes to tax law and the ambiguity of tax laws, the subjectivity of factual interpretations and other factors, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. If these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale or licensing of inventory, services and intellectual property are complex and can also affect our tax liabilities. In addition, any significant change to the tax system in the United States or in other jurisdictions, including changes in the taxation of international income, could adversely affect our financial statements.We are subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements.We are subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiture-related matters. These 22Table of Contentslawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. In addition, developments in legal proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. We cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and similar proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation. However, based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and similar proceedings in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2012 will have a material effect on our financial statements.If we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our business. The intellectual property rights that we obtain, however, may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. In addition, the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented or designed-around, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons, or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights.Third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.From time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. Any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to critical technology, be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services, be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements. Even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our financial statements. Product defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.Manufacturing or design defects in, unanticipated use of, safety or quality issues with respect to, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products that we make or sell (including in products or components that we source from third parties) can lead to personal injury, death or property damage. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products, result in the removal of a product from the market and result in product liability claims being brought against us. Recalls, removals and product liability claims can result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products.23Table of ContentsThe manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products, our business could suffer.The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters and environmental factors, and if not discovered before the product is released to market could result in recalls and product liability exposure. Because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities, an alternative manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity. Any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant costs and liability, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products.Our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow, and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately $5.3 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, based on the availability under our credit facilities as of December 31, 2012, we had the ability to incur an additional $1.3 billion of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facilities. Our debt level and related debt service obligations can have negative consequences, including (1) requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and capital investment; (2) reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and (3) exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. We may incur significantly more debt in the future, particularly to finance acquisitions. Our current revolving credit facility and long-term debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us; for more information please refer to the MD&A. If we breach any of these restrictions and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. In addition, any failure to maintain the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies would adversely affect our cost of funds and could adversely affect our liquidity and access to the capital markets. If we add new debt, the risks described above could increase.Adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns of, key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements.Certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and end-users. Some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors' products, and if they favor our competitors' products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. Adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners, or adverse developments in their financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns, could adversely affect our financial statements. The levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners, and changes in those levels, can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period. In addition, the consolidation of distributors in certain of our served industries, as well as the formation of large and sophisticated purchasing groups in industries such as healthcare, could adversely impact our profitability.Our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations.As discussed in “Item 1. Business - Materials,” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components, raw materials and other commodities. Prices for and availability of these components, raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past. Any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business. In addition, due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve, the cost-containment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to, if commodity prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions, or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs, we could experience lower margins and profitability and our financial statements could be adversely affected.24Table of ContentsIf we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand, our profitability may suffer. In addition, our reliance upon sole sources of supply for certain materials and components could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies.We purchase materials, components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations. Our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations, including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality. During a market upturn, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices. If we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand, we may not be able to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed or our costs may increase. Conversely, in order to secure supplies for the production of products, we sometimes enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer.In addition, some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. If these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, terrorist actions, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes. Any of these factors could result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies.Because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements. Any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our profitability.Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as regulations governing health and safety, the environment, food and drugs, privacy and electronic communications. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Any significant change in any of these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products. In addition, in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations. In these markets, the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations, or the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address, could adversely affect demand for our products. In addition, regulatory deadlines may result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period to period.Work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations. We have a number of U.S. collective bargaining units and various non-U.S. collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations. International economic, political, legal and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements. In 2012, approximately 57% of our sales were derived from customers outside the United States. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located outside the United States. Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the United States and increase the localization of our products and services, we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the United States, particularly in high-growth markets, such as China, India, Brazil and the Middle East. Our international business (and particularly our business in emerging markets) is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations, including:•interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers; •differences in terms of sale, including payment terms;•local product preferences and product requirements;25Table of Contents•changes in a country's or region's political or economic conditions (including safety and health issues and actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt);•trade protection measures and import or export restrictions and requirements;•unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including negative changes in tax laws;•limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash;•the potential for nationalization of enterprises;•changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs;•limitations on legal rights and our ability to enforce such rights;•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;•differing labor regulations;•difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis; and•differing protection of intellectual property.Any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and growth.If we suffer loss to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed.Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. If any of these facilities, supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses. The third-party insurance coverage that we maintain with respect to these and other risks will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against losses.A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. We also collect and store sensitive data, including confidential business information and personal data. These systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. In addition, security breaches of our systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers. Any such events could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, each of which could adversely affect our business and our financial statements.Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements.The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets, investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements.ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNot applicable.26Table of ContentsITEM 2. PROPERTIESOur corporate headquarters are located in Washington, D.C. in a facility that we lease. At December 31, 2012, we had approximately 242 significant manufacturing and distribution facilities worldwide. 125 of these facilities are located in the United States in over 40 states and 117 are located outside the United States in over 50 other countries, primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia, the rest of North America, South America and Australia. These facilities cover approximately 23.6 million square feet, of which approximately 13.7 million square feet are owned and approximately 9.9 million square feet are leased. Particularly outside the United States, facilities often serve more than one business segment and may be used for multiple purposes, such as administration, sales, manufacturing, warehousing and/or distribution. The number of significant facilities by business segment is:•Test & Measurement, 40;•Environmental, 42;•Life Sciences & Diagnostics, 74;•Dental, 29; and•Industrial Technologies, 57.We consider our facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used and do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. We believe our properties and equipment have been well-maintained.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide a reader of Danaher’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of Company management. The Company’s MD&A is divided into five main sections:•Overview•Results of Operations•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Critical Accounting Estimates•New Accounting StandardsOVERVIEWGeneralPlease see “Item 1. Business – General” for a discussion of Danaher’s objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value. Danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations. During 2012, approximately 57% of Danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the United States. As a diversified, global business, Danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors. Danaher’s geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of its products and services, typically helps limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results. Given the broad range of products manufactured, services provided and geographies served, management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the Company. The Company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.As a result of the Company’s geographic and industry diversity, the Company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges, including rapid technological development in most of the Company’s served markets, the expansion of opportunities in emerging markets (also referred to in this report as ""high-growth markets""), trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force, consolidation of the Company’s competitors and increasing regulation. The Company defines high-growth markets as developing markets of the world experiencing rapid growth in gross domestic product and infrastructure which includes Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia with the exception of Japan and Australia. The Company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and the Company’s long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in high-growth geographies and high-growth product segments, identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative and differentiated new products and services with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of the Company’s sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment. The Company is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources (particularly in high-growth markets) in order to be responsive to the Company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the Company’s operations. Business Performance and OutlookWhile differences exist among the Company’s businesses, on an overall basis, demand for the Company’s products and services increased in 2012 as compared to 2011 resulting in aggregate year-over-year sales growth from existing businesses. In addition, the Company’s previous investment in sales growth initiatives and the other business-specific factors discussed below contributed to year-over-year sales growth. Geographically, year-over-year sales growth rates from existing businesses during 2012 were led primarily by the high-growth markets. Sales in high-growth markets grew at a high-single digit rate in 2012 compared to 2011 and represented approximately 25% of the Company's total sales in 2012. Sales growth rates in developed markets grew at a low-single digit rate compared to 2011 and were led by North America which grew at a low-single digit rate in 2012, partially offset by modest year-over-year contraction in Western Europe and Japan. Providing no significant deterioration in general economic conditions occurs, the Company expects sales from existing businesses to continue to grow on a year-over-year basis during 2013 with sales growth returning to the Test & Measurement segment and the other segments growing at rates experienced in 2012.32Table of ContentsThe acquisition of Beckman Coulter, Inc. (“Beckman Coulter”) in June 2011 has provided additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Company’s Life Sciences and Diagnostics segment by expanding the businesses’ geographic and product line breadth, including new and complementary product and service offerings in the areas of clinical diagnostics and life sciences research, and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses. As Beckman Coulter continues to be integrated into the Company, the Company is also realizing significant cost synergies through the application of the Danaher Business System and the combined purchasing power of the Company and Beckman Coulter. For a discussion of the acquisition’s impact on the Company and segment results, refer to the “Results of Operations” section of this MD&A.Restructuring ActivitiesIn light of the continuing uncertainties in the macro-economic environment and consistent with the Company's approach of positioning itself to provide superior products and services to its customers in a cost efficient manner, in July 2012, Danaher's Board of Directors (the ""Board"") committed to a plan to implement further cost reductions in the Company's businesses. The plan, which was substantially completed by December 31, 2012, resulted in pre-tax charges of $123 million, the majority of which was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2012. The charges, including both employee-related termination costs as well as other termination and exit costs, are expected to result in annualized savings of approximately $90 million in 2013 compared to 2012 expense levels.In addition, the Company incurred $179 million of costs associated with restructuring activities in 2011, including costs associated with the integration and restructuring of the Beckman Coulter business subsequent to the acquisition. Excluding Beckman Coulter, the 2011 restructuring activities resulted in savings of approximately $100 million in 2012 compared to 2011 expense levels. AcquisitionsDuring 2012, the Company acquired fourteen businesses for total consideration of $1.8 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company's five segments. The aggregate annual sales of the fourteen businesses acquired at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $666 million. On June 30, 2011, following the successful completion of the Company’s tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Beckman Coulter, the Company completed the acquisition of Beckman Coulter for total cash consideration of $5.5 billion (net of cash acquired) and the assumption of $1.6 billion in indebtedness of Beckman Coulter. Beckman Coulter had revenues of $3.7 billion in 2010, and is included in the Company’s Life Sciences & Diagnostics segment.For a full discussion of the Company’s 2011 and 2010 acquisition activity, refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources —Investing Activities”.DivestituresIn January 2012, the Company completed the sale of its integrated scanning system business (the Accu-Sort (""ASI"") business) for a sale price of $132 million in cash. In addition, in February 2012, the Company completed the sale of its Kollmorgen Electro-Optical (""KEO"") business for a sale price of $205 million in cash. These businesses were part of the Industrial Technologies segment. The businesses had combined annual revenues of $275 million in 2011. The Company recorded an aggregate after-tax gain on the sale of these businesses of $94 million or $0.13 per diluted share in its first quarter 2012 results in connection with the closing of these transactions.In April 2011, the Company completed the divestiture of its Pacific Scientific Aerospace (“PSA”) business for a sale price of $680 million in cash. This business, which was also part of the Industrial Technologies segment had annual revenues of $377 million in 2010. The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the sale of PSA of $202 million or $0.29 per diluted share in its second quarter 2011 results in connection with the closing of the transaction.The Company has reported the ASI, KEO and PSA businesses as discontinued operations in its consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the results of operations for all periods presented reflect these businesses as discontinued operations and the assets and liabilities of these businesses have been classified as held for sale for all periods presented. Sale of Investment in Joint VentureDuring 2010, the Company entered into a joint venture with Cooper Industries, plc (“Cooper”), combining certain of the Company’s hand tool businesses with Cooper’s Tools business to form a new entity called Apex Tool Group, LLC (“Apex”). In February 2013, the Company and Cooper sold Apex to an unrelated third party for approximately $1.6 billion. The Company expects to realize after-tax net proceeds of approximately $650 million and recognize an after-tax gain of approximately $138 million or $0.19 per diluted share from the sale in the first quarter of 2013. 33Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSConsolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 13.5% compared to 2011. Sales from existing businesses contributed 2.5% growth and sales from acquired businesses contributed 13.0% growth on a year-over-year basis. The impact of currency translation decreased sales by 2.0% as the U.S. dollar was, on average, stronger against other major currencies during 2012 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2011. In this report, references to sales from existing businesses refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) but excluding (1) sales from acquired businesses, (2) 2010 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the Apex joint venture, and (3) the impact of currency translation. References to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to GAAP sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the impact from the 2012 divestiture of certain Beckman Coulter product lines, the sales from which (prior to the divestiture) were included in sales from acquired businesses. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses and 2010 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the Apex joint venture) and (b) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses and 2010 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the Apex joint venture) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. Sales from existing businesses should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting the non-GAAP financial measure of sales from existing businesses provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from sales from existing businesses because currency translation is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions and related items because the nature, size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. The Company excludes the effect of the 2010 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the Apex joint venture because the Company did not recognize sales from those businesses in any period subsequent to the formation of the joint venture. References to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales.Operating profit margins were 17.3% for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to 16.3% in 2011. Year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons benefited 100 basis points from the favorable impact of higher sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with ongoing productivity improvement initiatives including the restructuring actions taken in 2012 and 2011, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments. In addition, acquisition related charges recorded in 2011 associated with the Beckman Coulter acquisition, including transaction costs deemed significant, change in control charges and fair value adjustments to acquisition related inventory and deferred revenue balances favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 100 basis points. During 2012, the Company also recognized a gain relating to the resolution of contingencies with respect to a prior disposition of assets which favorably impacted operating profit margin comparisons by 5 basis points. The dilutive effect of acquisitions adversely impacted operating profit margin comparisons by 105 basis points and partially offset these positive factors. Operating profit margins were 16.3% for each of the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons benefited 160 basis points from the favorable impact of higher sales volumes and ongoing productivity improvements net of the impact of costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments. The dilutive effect of acquisitions (net of the favorable impact to operating profit margin of contributing certain businesses to the Apex joint venture in July 2010) adversely impacted operating margin comparisons by 110 basis points. In addition, acquisition related charges associated with the Beckman Coulter acquisition, including transaction costs deemed significant, change in control charges and fair value adjustments to acquisition related inventory and deferred revenue balances (net of comparable acquisition related charges in 2010) adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 50 basis points.The Company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant (generally relating to the Company’s larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for the Company in a given period.34Table of ContentsBusiness SegmentsThe following table summarizes sales by business segment for each of the periods indicated ($ in millions): For the Year Ended December 31 2012 2011 2010Test & Measurement$3,381.0 $3,390.9 $2,832.9Environmental3,063.5 2,939.6 2,738.0Life Sciences & Diagnostics6,485.1 4,627.4 2,298.3Dental2,022.9 2,011.2 1,824.6Industrial Technologies3,307.9 3,121.4 2,540.6Businesses contributed to Apex joint venture— — 315.6Total$18,260.4 $16,090.5 $12,550.0TEST & MEASUREMENTThe Company’s Test & Measurement segment is a leading global provider of electronic measurement instruments and monitoring, management and optimization tools for communications and enterprise networks and related services.

Instrument demand was weak in all major geographies although the North American market showed improvement in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to the results reported during the first nine months of 2012. Europe and Japan continued to remain weak in the fourth quarter of 35Table of Contents2012. Sales in the segment's communications businesses grew at a high-single digit rate during 2012 compared to 2011 with strong growth in North America and Western Europe in the first six months of 2012 moderating in the second half of 2012 due primarily to project timing and difficult prior year comparisons. Demand for network management solutions and, to a lesser extent, core network enterprise solutions drove the 2012 growth. Operating profit margins declined 150 basis points during 2012 as compared to 2011. Year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons were adversely impacted by 120 basis points as lower instrument sales volumes and incremental year-over-year costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments more than offset the favorable impacts of increased sales volumes of higher operating profit margin communication business products and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with ongoing productivity improvement initiatives, including the restructuring actions taken in 2012 and 2011. The dilutive effect of acquired businesses adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 30 basis points.2011 COMPARED TO 2010 Year-over-year price increases in the segment had a negligible impact on sales growth during 2011.During 2011, sales in the segment’s instrument businesses grew on a year-over-year basis due to increased demand for oscilloscopes and service and installation tools, partially offset by year-over-year declines in sales attributable to products serving the video end markets. Instrument sales grew in all major geographies during the year led by Asia and other high-growth markets. Instrument sales grew primarily during the first three quarters of 2011 as fourth quarter 2011 sales were essentially flat compared to 2010. Sales in the segment’s communications businesses also grew during 2011 on a year-over-year basis, primarily in North America, as a result of strong demand for both network management solutions and core network enterprise solutions. Global demand for network security and analysis solutions was also robust in 2011.Operating profit margins increased 200 basis points during 2011 as compared to 2010. Year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons benefited 220 basis points from the favorable impact of higher sales volumes and ongoing productivity improvements net of the impact of costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments. The dilutive effect of acquired businesses adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 20 basis points.ENVIRONMENTALThe Company’s Environmental segment provides products that help protect customers’ water supply and air quality and serves two primary markets: water quality and retail/commercial petroleum.

Sales growth was driven by increased demand for the businesses' laboratory and process instruments, consumables and related service primarily in the high-growth markets (other than China) and the North American industrial market. This growth was partially moderated by flat year-over-year demand in China and Western Europe. Sales in the business' chemical treatment solutions product line grew at a low-double digit rate on a year-over-year basis due primarily to the addition of new customers in the U.S. market and to a lesser extent continued international expansion. Sales in the business' ultraviolet water disinfection product line declined during the year due primarily to lower 2012 demand from municipal end markets. Sales from existing businesses in the segment's retail petroleum equipment businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2012 compared to 2011. Increased demand for the business' dispensing equipment and associated services in North America were partially offset by contraction in Western Europe as demand for retail and payment systems declined from 2011's level. Demand for most major product categories was strong in high-growth markets, especially Latin America, Russia and the Middle East. Operating profit margins increased 10 basis points during 2012 as compared to 2011. Year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons benefited 70 basis points from the favorable impact of higher sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with ongoing productivity improvement initiatives, including the restructuring actions taken in 2012 and 2011, offsetting incremental year-over-year costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments. The dilutive effect of acquisitions adversely impacted year-over-year operating margin comparisons by 60 basis points.2011 COMPARED TO 2010Price increases in the segment contributed 1.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2011 as compared to 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s water quality businesses grew at a high-single digit rate during 2011 as compared to 2010. Strong demand during the first half of 2011 for the businesses’ laboratory and process instrumentation product lines in the municipal and industrial markets moderated slightly during the second half of 2011. While demand in the China municipal market increased on a year-over-year basis during 2011, the rate of revenue growth for the year declined compared to the 2010 growth rate. Sales in the business’ ultraviolet water treatment product line grew at a low-double digit rate on a year-over-year basis as municipal markets returned to growth in the second half of the year, and in particular during the fourth quarter, after having declined in the first half of 2011. Sales in the business’ chemical treatment solutions product line also grew at a low-double digit rate on a year-over-year basis primarily due to the addition of new customers in the U.S. market and to a lesser extent to continued international expansion.Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s retail/commercial petroleum equipment businesses declined at a low-single digit rate during 2011 as compared to 2010. The year-over-year sales decline during the period is primarily attributable to 2010 performance dynamics. The business generated strong sales of payment and point-of-sale retail solutions product offerings in 2010, particularly the first half of 2010, driven by deadlines for compliance with enhanced industry security standards. During 2011, increased demand for the business’ automatic tank gauge products and dispensing equipment in all major geographies resulted in year-over-year sales growth that partially offset the unfavorable impact of the difficult prior year comparison.Operating profit margins increased 60 basis points during 2011 as compared to 2010. Year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons benefited 70 basis points from the favorable impact of higher sales volumes and continued productivity improvements net of the impact of costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments. 37Table of ContentsThe dilutive effect of acquired businesses adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 10 basis points.LIFE SCIENCES & DIAGNOSTICSThe Company’s diagnostics businesses offer a broad range of analytical instruments, reagents, consumables, software and services that hospitals, physician’s offices, reference laboratories and other critical care settings use to diagnose disease and make treatment decisions.

Sales associated with acquisitions are presented net of the impact of the 2012 divestiture of certain Beckman Coulter product lines, the sales from which (prior to the divestiture) were included in sales from acquired businesses. Given the insignificance of these product line sales to the segment's results of operations, prior year information was not restated to reflect these divestitures as discontinued operations.Sales from existing businesses in the segment's diagnostics business grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2012 as compared to 2011 due to increased demand in the clinical, acute care and pathology diagnostic businesses. Strong sales of consumables and automation hardware in the clinical diagnostic business in high-growth markets, especially China, more than offset weaker year-over-year sales performance in North America and Europe. In the acute care diagnostic business, sales grew due to continued strong global consumable sales related to the business' installed base of instrumentation as well as robust demand for compact blood gas analyzers. Increased demand for the business' cardiac care instruments, particularly in China, also contributed to year-over-year sales growth. Increased demand, primarily in North America and high-growth markets, for advanced staining consumables, and to a lesser extent histology systems, drove the majority of year-over-year sales growth in the pathology diagnostics business. Sales from existing businesses in the segment's life sciences businesses grew at a low-single digit rate during 2012 as compared to 2011. Sales of the business' broad range of mass spectrometers grew on a year-over-year basis as sales growth in the applied and clinical research markets was partially offset by sales declines in the pharmaceutical and academic research markets. Sales growth in the mass spectrometry business was strong in China and other high-growth markets. Sales of the business' 38Table of Contentsmicroscopy products also grew for the year in most major geographic markets due to strong demand for the business' recently introduced confocal product offering. Operating profit margins increased 460 basis points during 2012 as compared to 2011. Acquisition related charges associated with the 2011 Beckman Coulter acquisition, including transaction costs deemed significant, change in control charges and fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue balances favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 365 basis points. Higher sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with ongoing productivity improvement initiatives, including the restructuring actions taken in 2012 and 2011, net of the impact of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments, favorably impacted year-over-year comparisons by 200 basis points. The dilutive effect of acquisitions adversely impacted segment operating profit margins by 105 basis points.Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales increased during 2012 primarily as a result of the inclusion of twelve months of Beckman Coulter's results in 2012 as compared to six months of Beckman Coulter's results in 2011. Depreciation and amortization expense in the segment in future periods is expected to be in line with 2012 levels reflecting the continued impact of Beckman Coulter. For a discussion of the impact of Beckman Coulter's business model on the Company's depreciation and amortization costs, please see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Operating Activities.”2011 COMPARED TO 2010 Price increases in the segment contributed 0.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2011 as compared to 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.The significant growth related to acquisitions was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Beckman Coulter in June 2011 which significantly expanded the segment’s product and service offerings, as further described below.Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s acute care diagnostics business grew at a high-single digit rate during 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to continued strong consumable sales related to the business’ installed base of acute care diagnostic instrumentation and new instrument placements, primarily in Europe, China and other Asian markets. Demand for the business’ compact blood gas analyzer also remained strong, particularly in high-growth markets. Increased European and high-growth market demand for the business’ cardiac care instruments also contributed to year-over-year sales growth. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s pathology diagnostics business also grew at a high-single digit rate during 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of increased demand for advanced staining instruments and consumables, as well as higher sales of core histology systems and consumables, primarily in North America and high-growth markets, and to a lesser extent, Europe. The acquisition of Beckman Coulter has significantly expanded the segment’s product portfolio in the area of clinical diagnostics through the addition of new and complementary product and service offerings.Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s microscopy businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of strong demand for confocal and compound instrumentation serving the life sciences research and industrial markets, particularly in China and high-growth markets, and to a lesser extent, Europe. A difficult prior year comparison resulting from first quarter 2010 sales associated with Japanese economic stimulus funding partially reduced the sales growth for 2011. Strong demand for the business’ broad range of mass spectrometers serving both the academic and proteomic research markets as well as the applied markets resulted in a low-double digit growth rate from sales from existing businesses in the segment’s mass spectrometry business during 2011 as compared to 2010. Sales from existing businesses in the mass spectrometry business grew in all major geographies during 2011 led by strong performance in the Asia Pacific region and North America and to a lesser extent Europe. The acquisition of Beckman Coulter has also expanded the segment’s product portfolio in the area of life sciences research through the addition of new and complementary product and service offerings.Operating profit margins decreased 120 basis points during 2011 as compared to 2010. The dilutive effect of acquisitions, primarily related to costs associated with Beckman Coulter’s restructuring and integration activities, adversely impacted segment operating profit margins by 295 basis points. Acquisition related charges associated with the Beckman Coulter acquisition, including transaction costs deemed significant, change in control charges and fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue balances (net of comparable acquisition related charges in 2010) also adversely impacted operating profit margins by 95 basis points. Higher sales volumes and ongoing productivity improvements, net of the impact of costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments, favorably impacted year-over-year comparisons by 270 basis points. 39Table of ContentsDepreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales increased during 2011 primarily as a result of the increase in amortization expense associated with the intangible assets acquired in connection with the Beckman Coulter acquisition. In addition, as a majority of the Beckman Coulter customers enter into operating-type lease arrangements for the use of the business’ instrumentation, depreciation expense increased on a year-over-year basis. DENTALThe Company’s Dental segment is a leading worldwide provider of a broad range of equipment, consumables and services for the dental market, focused on driving technological innovations that help dental professionals improve clinical outcomes and enhance productivity.Dental Selected Financial Data ($ in millions) For the Year Ended December 31 2012 2011 2010Sales$2,022.9 $2,011.2 $1,824.6Operating profit 293.1 236.1 203.3Depreciation and amortization92.4 94.0 81.7Restructuring and other related charges9.8 28.3 —Operating profit as a % of sales14.5% 11.7% 11.1%Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales4.6% 4.7% 4.5%Restructuring and other related charges as a % of sales0.5% 1.4% —Components of Sales Growth 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010Existing businesses3.5 % 4.5%Acquisitions0.5 % 2.5%Currency exchange rates(3.5)% 3.0%Total0.5 % 10.0%2012 COMPARED TO 2011 Year-over-year price increases in the segment had a negligible impact on sales during 2012. Sales from existing businesses in the segment's dental consumables businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2012 as compared to 2011, primarily as a result of increased sales of general dentistry consumables and orthodontic products. Sales of dental consumables grew in all major geographies. Sales from existing businesses in the segment's dental equipment business grew at a low-single digit rate on a year-over-year basis as a result of increased demand for treatment units and associated equipment, primarily in high-growth markets, as well as higher year-over-year sales of imaging products. During 2012, sales increased in all major product categories on a year-over-year basis as increased demand in North America and high-growth markets more than offset lower demand in Europe. Operating profit margins increased 280 basis points during 2012 as compared to 2011. Higher operating profit margins from additional sales volume in addition to incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with ongoing productivity improvement initiatives including the restructuring actions taken in 2012 and 2011, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments, increased operating profit margins by 270 basis points on a year-over-year basis. In addition, net higher overall operating profit margins of acquired businesses favorably impacted year-over-year comparisons by 10 basis points.2011 COMPARED TO 2010 Price increases throughout the segment contributed 1.0% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2011 as compared to 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.40Table of ContentsSales from existing businesses in the dental consumables businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate in 2011 driven primarily by increased demand for general dentistry consumables and orthodontic products and, to a lesser extent, infection control products. Sales in the dental consumables business grew in all major geographies. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s dental equipment business grew on a year-over-year basis at a mid-single digit rate due to strong imaging and instrument product demand. Increased sales of imaging products were led by North America, and to lesser extent, high-growth markets, while instrument sales growth was driven largely by North America and Europe.Operating profit margins increased 60 basis points during 2011 as compared to 2010. Higher sales volumes and ongoing productivity improvements, including cost reduction actions in the dental equipment businesses, net of the impact of costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments increased operating profit margin by 95 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The dilutive effect of acquired businesses adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 35 basis points.INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIESThe Company’s Industrial Technologies segment designs and manufactures components and systems that are typically incorporated by original equipment manufacturers and system integrators for sale into a diverse set of applications and end-markets. The businesses in this segment also provide service and support, including helping customers with integration and installation and providing services to ensure performance and up-time. The Industrial Technologies segment consists of two strategic lines of business, product identification and motion, as well as the sensors and controls, energetic materials and engine retarder businesses. The Company sold its ASI business in January 2012, its KEO business in February 2012 and its PSA business in April 2011. These businesses were previously reported as part of the Industrial Technologies segment. The results of these discontinued operations are excluded from all periods presented in the financial information provided in the tables below.Industrial Technologies Segment Selected Financial Data ($ in millions) For the Year Ended December 31 2012 2011 2010Sales$3,307.9 $3,121.4 $2,540.6Operating profit685.6 655.0 513.3Depreciation and amortization80.8 65.8 51.5Restructuring and other related charges29.1 23.8 —Operating profit as a % of sales20.7% 21.0% 20.2%Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales2.4% 2.1% 2.0%Restructuring and other related charges as a % of sales0.9% 0.8% —Components of Sales Growth 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010Existing businesses1.5 % 11.5%Acquisitions6.5 % 9.5%Currency exchange rates(2.0)% 2.0%Total6.0 % 23.0%2012 COMPARED TO 2011 Price increases throughout the segment contributed 1.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2012 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.Sales from existing businesses in the segment's product identification businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2012 as compared to 2011, due primarily to continued demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables, with strong growth experienced in both Europe and China. Increased year-over-year demand for the business' integrated packaging solutions product lines also contributed to the existing business' sales growth in the second half of 2012, with growth in most major geographies and particular strength in North America. The Company's acquisition of X-Rite, Incorporated, a global 41Table of Contentsleader in color measurement technology, in the second quarter of 2012 expands the product identification business into a new, adjacent market and has broadened the sales and earnings growth opportunities for the business by expanding the business' product line range as well as through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses.Sales from existing businesses in the segment's motion businesses declined at a mid-single digit rate during 2012 as compared to 2011 due to continued soft demand in the majority of end markets served, particularly technology and factory automation related end markets. Both the industrial automation and engineered solutions product lines experienced year-over-year sales declines. The businesses saw improved growth in the fourth quarter of 2012 in part due to easier year-over-year comparisons.Sales from existing businesses in the segment's other businesses collectively grew at a low-single digit rate during 2012 as compared to 2011. Sales in the segment's energetic materials business increased on a year-over-year basis, partially offset by lower demand in the segment's sensors and controls and engine retarder businesses. Operating profit margins declined 30 basis points during 2012 compared to 2011. The net dilutive effect of acquired businesses adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 105 basis points. Higher sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with continuing productivity improvement initiatives, including the restructuring actions taken in 2012 and 2011, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments, increased operating profit margins by 75 basis points on a year-over-year basis.2011 COMPARED TO 2010 Price increases throughout the segment contributed 2.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2011 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s product identification businesses grew at a high-single digit rate on a year-over-year basis during 2011, primarily due to continued strong demand for core marking and coding equipment. Consumable sales associated with the installed base of marking and coding equipment also contributed to year-over-year growth. Sales grew in all major geographies. The 2011 acquisition of EskoArtwork, a leading full service solutions provider for the digital packaging and design and production market, provides additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the segment by expanding the businesses’ product line range and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses.Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s motion businesses grew at a high-single digit rate during 2011. Sales growth rates declined in the second half of 2011 compared to growth rates in the first half of 2011, in part due to easier prior year comparisons in the first half of 2011 as well as the impact of slowing demand on a global basis in the second half of 2011, primarily in the technology-related and solar end markets. Year-over-year sales increases in engineered solutions and linear and mechanical motion products during the second half of 2011 more than offset sales declines in industrial automation that occurred primarily in the fourth quarter 2011. Sales grew in all major geographies. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s other businesses grew collectively at a mid-teens rate during 2011 as compared to 2010 due to generally higher demand in the majority of end-markets served.Operating profit margins increased 80 basis points during 2011 as compared to 2010. Year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons benefited 135 basis points from the favorable impact of higher sales volumes and ongoing productivity improvements. The net dilutive effect of acquired businesses adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 55 basis points.COST OF SALES AND GROSS PROFIT For the Year Ended December 31($ in millions)2012 2011 2010Sales$18,260.4 $16,090.5 $12,550.0Cost of sales8,846.1 7,913.9 6,145.5Gross profit9,414.3 8,176.6 6,404.5Gross profit margin51.6% 50.8% 51.0%Gross profit margins increased 80 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2012 compared to 2011. Year-over-year gross profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by 70 basis points as a result of acquisition related charges recorded in 2011 associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances in connection with the acquisition of Beckman Coulter in June 2011. In addition, year-over-year gross profit margin comparisons also benefited from 42Table of Contentshigher year-over-year sales volumes, incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with 2011 restructuring activities (net of 2012 restructuring spending) and ongoing productivity improvements. The impact of a full twelve months of Beckman Coulter results in 2012 (compared to only six months of Beckman Coulter results in 2011), partially offset these positive factors as the Beckman Coulter business has lower gross profit margins on average than the Company's existing businesses. Gross profit margins decreased 20 basis points during 2011 as compared to 2010. The combination of the acquisition of Beckman Coulter, which has lower gross profit margins on average than the Company’s existing businesses, and 35 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2011 compared to 2010 adversely impacted year-over-year gross profit margin comparisons. In addition, acquisition related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances in connection with the acquisition of Beckman Coulter (net of comparable acquisition related charges in 2010 relating primarily to the AB Sciex, Molecular Devices and certain other acquisitions) adversely impacted gross profit margin comparisons by 45 basis points. Higher year-over-year sales volumes and ongoing productivity improvements partially offset these adverse impacts. The gross profit margin comparison also reflects the benefit of 65 basis points from the contribution to the Apex joint venture at the beginning of the third quarter 2010 of certain of the Company’s hand tools businesses, which had lower average gross profit margins than the remainder of the Company.In 2010, the U.S. government passed health care reform legislation which, among other provisions, imposes a 2.3% excise tax on the sale or importation of certain medical devices. These provisions apply to various products in the Company's Life Sciences and Diagnostics and Dental segments and become effective in 2013. The excise tax is expected to increase the Company's cost of sales in 2013 by approximately $35 million compared to 2012.OPERATING EXPENSES For the Year Ended December 31($ in millions)2012 2011 2010Sales$18,260.4 $16,090.5 $12,550.0Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses5,181.2 4,607.7 3,603.7Research and development (“R&D”) expenses1,137.9 1,018.5 774.0SG&A as a % of sales28.4% 28.6% 28.7%R&D as a % of sales6.2% 6.3% 6.2%Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 20 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2012 compared to 2011. Increased leverage of the Company's cost base resulting from higher sales and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with 2011 restructuring activities (net of 2012 restructuring activities) were partially offset by incremental year-over-year investments in the Company's sales and marketing growth investments. Year-over-year comparisons were also favorably impacted by a mark to market gain on a currency swap arrangement in 2012 (refer to “Financial Instruments and Risk Management—Currency Exchange Rate Risk”). In addition, change in control payments to Beckman Coulter employees in connection with the closing of the Beckman Coulter acquisition in June 2011, as well as associated restructuring and integration charges, favorably impacted the year-over-year comparison.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2011 as compared to 2010. Increased leverage of the Company’s cost base resulting from higher sales volumes during 2011 was partially offset by 60 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2011 compared to 2010 and ongoing investments in the Company’s sales growth initiatives. In addition, change in control payments to Beckman Coulter employees in connection with the closing of the Beckman Coulter acquisition adversely impacted selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales during 2011.Research and development expenses consist principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs. Research and development expenses have remained relatively consistent as a percentage of sales over the last three years. The increase in these expenses on a year-over-year basis is primarily attributable to the full year impact of research and development expenditures associated with recently acquired businesses, primarily Beckman Coulter, as well as incremental year-over-year investments in the Company's new product development initiatives.43Table of ContentsEARNINGS FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTUREIn July 2010 the Company closed on the formation of the Apex joint venture. As of the closing of the transaction, the Company deconsolidated its contributed businesses and commenced accounting for its investment in the joint venture based on the equity method of accounting. The equity in the earnings of Apex, reflecting the Company’s 50% ownership position subsequent to the formation, is reflected in the earnings from unconsolidated joint venture caption in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The impact on the Company’s results of operations from (1) the contributed business prior to the formation of Apex, and (2) the Company’s equity in the earnings of Apex subsequent to the formation of Apex, is reflected in the table below ($ in millions): For the Year Ended December 31 2012 2011 2010Prior to formation of Apex Sales— — $315.6Operating profit— — 41.5Subsequent to formation of Apex Earnings from unconsolidated joint venture$69.9 $66.8 22.8Earnings from unconsolidated joint venture increased $3 million for 2012 as compared to 2011, primarily due to the favorable impact of higher production volumes and Apex's actions to improve overall cost productivity. Earnings from unconsolidated joint venture increased $44 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 as 2011 reflected a full year of earnings as compared to only six months of earnings in 2010 following the closing of the formation of the joint venture in July 2010.INTEREST COSTSFor a description of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness, refer to “–Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities and Indebtedness” below.Interest expense of $158 million for 2012 was approximately $16 million higher than in 2011. The increase in interest expense in 2012 results primarily from the additional debt incurred during the second quarter of 2011 in connection with the Beckman Coulter acquisition. Interest expense of $142 million in 2011 was approximately $25 million higher than 2010 interest expense of $117 million. The increase in interest expense during 2011 also results primarily from the additional debt incurred in connection with the Beckman Coulter acquisition. The Company's average commercial paper borrowings were also higher in 2011 as compared to 2010, in large part due to borrowings used to partially fund the acquisition of Beckman Coulter.Interest income of $3 million, $5 million and $6 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis.INCOME TAXESGeneralIncome tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the Company’s financial statements. The Company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.The Company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions and changes in tax laws. For a description of the tax treatment of earnings held outside the United States, refer to “—Cash and Cash Requirements” below.The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for contingent tax liabilities. Based on these reviews, the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities, tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations, reserves are adjusted as necessary. For a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.44Table of ContentsTax Provision and Effective Tax RateThe Company’s effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was 23.6%, 20.9% and 22.9%, respectively.The Company’s effective tax rate for each of 2012, 2011 and 2010 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due principally to the Company’s earnings outside the United States that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate. The effective tax rate of 23.6% in 2012 is also lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate due to recognition of tax benefits associated with favorable resolution of certain international and domestic uncertain tax positions and the lapse of certain statutes of limitations, in addition to changes in estimates related to reserves associated with prior period uncertain tax positions. These matters have been treated as discrete items in the periods they occurred and reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately 30 basis points in 2012.The effective tax rate of 20.9% in 2011 is also lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate due to recognition of tax benefits associated with favorable resolutions of certain international and domestic uncertain tax positions as a result of a tax ruling, court decision, and the lapse of certain tax statutes of limitations, in addition to changes in estimates related to reserves associated with prior period uncertain tax positions. These matters have been treated as discrete items in the periods they occurred and reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately 240 basis points in 2011.The Company’s 2010 effective tax rate of 22.9% is also lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate due to recognition of tax benefits associated with favorable resolution of certain international and domestic tax positions and the lapse of certain tax statutes of limitations. These matters have been treated as discrete items in the periods they occurred and reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately 60 basis points in 2010.On January 2, 2013, the American Tax Relief Act of 2012 (the ""Act"") was signed into law which included tax relief for businesses by reinstating retroactively to January 1, 2012, certain tax benefits and credits that had expired. Included in the reinstatement were the U.S. federal research and development tax credit and the controlled foreign corporation look-through provision, which would have collectively lowered the Company's effective tax rate by approximately 75 basis points for 2012. However, as the Act was enacted in 2013, the retroactive tax benefit was not included in the 2012 effective tax rate and will be treated as a discrete benefit during the first quarter of 2013. The effective tax rate for 2013 is expected to be approximately 24%, excluding the discrete benefit from the Act noted above. The anticipated increase from the 2012 rate is primarily attributable to changes in international tax legislation, partially offset by the benefit on 2013's effective tax rate from the reinstatement of the tax benefits under the Act noted above.INFLATIONThe effect of inflation on the Company’s revenues and net earnings was not significant in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 or 2010.45Table of ContentsFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENTThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit risk, equity prices and commodity prices, each of which could impact its financial statements. The Company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. In addition, the Company’s broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole.Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. A change in interest rates on long-term debt impacts the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt but not the Company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2012, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt (excluding the LYONs, which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from its underlying common stock) by approximately $137 million. However, since the Company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturity, the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt does not affect the Company’s results of operations or stockholders’ equity.As of December 31, 2012, the Company’s variable-rate debt obligations consisted primarily of U.S. dollar and Euro denominated commercial paper borrowings and to a lesser extent, the Company's $300 million floating rate senior notes due 2013. As a result, the Company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar and Euro interest rates. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2012. As these shorter duration obligations mature, the Company anticipates issuing additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. In 2012, a 150% increase in average market interest rates on the Company’s commercial paper borrowings would have increased the Company’s interest expense by approximately $2 million. A 150% hypothetical fluctuation is used as the Company’s actual commercial paper interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2012. In 2012, a 50% increase in average market interest rates on the Company’s $300 million floating rate senior notes due 2013 would have increased the Company’s interest expense by approximately $1 million. A 50% hypothetical fluctuation is used as the Company’s actual coupon interest rates on such debt fluctuated near that amount during 2012.Currency Exchange Rate RiskThe Company faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries. The Eurobond Notes described below provide a natural hedge to a portion of the Company’s European net asset position. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the Company’s net investment in international subsidiaries, net of the translation effect of the Company’s Eurobond Notes, is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in major currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2012 (net of the translation effect of the Company’s Eurobond Notes) would have resulted in a reduction of stockholders’ equity of approximately $706 million.The Company also faces exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Although the Company has a U.S. dollar functional currency for reporting purposes, it has manufacturing sites throughout the world and a substantial portion of its costs are incurred, and sales are generated in foreign currencies. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively.Currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2012 sales by 2.0% on a year-over-year basis as the U.S. dollar was, on average, stronger against other major currencies during 2012 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2011. The U.S. dollar's strength against other major currencies throughout the majority of 2012 more than offset the positive impact on sales from the slight weakening of the U.S. dollar prior to the end of the fourth quarter 2012.If the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2012 were to prevail throughout 2013, currency exchange rates would positively impact 2013 sales by approximately 0.5% relative to the Company’s performance in 2012. Additional weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would further positively impact the Company’s sales and results of operations. 46Table of ContentsAny strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would adversely impact the Company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis.The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales, profit, and assets and liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In connection with a 2011 acquisition, the Company acquired a currency swap agreement that requires the Company to purchase approximately 184 million Japanese Yen (JPY/¥) at a rate of $1/¥102.25 on a monthly basis through June 1, 2018. As of December 31, 2012, the aggregate Japanese Yen purchase commitment was approximately ¥11.9 billion (approximately $138 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2012). The currency swap does not qualify for hedge accounting, and as a result changes in the fair value of the currency swap are reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded pre-tax income of approximately $22 million and a pre-tax charge of approximately $8 million, respectively, related to changes in the fair value of this currency swap. Credit RiskThe Company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, receivables from customers and derivatives. The Company places cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the Company’s customers. The Company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate.The Company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and with the exception of the Yen swap noted above such transactions are generally insignificant to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. These transactions are entered into only with high-quality financial institutions and exposure at any one institution is limited.Equity Price RiskThe Company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio includes publicly traded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale investments due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the equity securities. A 10% decline in the value of these equity securities as of December 31, 2012 would have reduced the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio by approximately $33 million.Commodity Price RiskFor a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices, refer “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”47Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESManagement assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses, consummating strategic acquisitions, paying interest and servicing debt and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. Following is an overview of the Company's cash flows and liquidity for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010: Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity For the Years Ended December 31($ in millions)2012 2011 2010Total operating cash flows provided by continuing operations$3,502.1 $2,732.1 $2,018.7 Payments for additions to property, plant and equipment$(458.3) $(334.5) $(191.1)Cash paid for acquisitions(1,796.8) (6,210.8) (2,129.7)Proceeds from sale of discontinued operations337.5 680.1 —Other sources30.0 17.9 31.9Net cash used in investing activities$(1,887.6) $(5,847.3) $(2,288.9) Proceeds from the issuance of common stock$212.0 $1,112.5 $178.4Purchase of treasury stock(648.4) — —Repayments of long-term debt(61.5) (1,602.4) (9.4)Proceeds from public debt offerings— 1,785.8 —Net proceeds from borrowings with maturities of less than 90 days195.9 854.0 —Payment of dividends(86.4) (61.3) (52.2)Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities$(388.4) $2,088.6 $116.8•Operating cash flows from continuing operations, a key source of the Company’s liquidity, increased $770 million, or approximately 28%, during 2012 as compared to 2011.•Cash paid for acquisitions constituted the most significant use of cash during 2012. The Company acquired fourteen businesses during 2012 for total consideration (net of cash acquired) of approximately $1.8 billion.•In January 2012, the Company completed the sale of its ASI business and, in February 2012, the Company completed the sale of its KEO business. Aggregate cash proceeds in 2012 in connection with the completed sales were $337 million.•The Company repurchased approximately 12.5 million shares of Company common stock in open market transactions at a cost of $648 million and an average price of approximately $52 per share.•The Company contributed approximately $55 million in cash to the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan and approximately $53 million to the Company’s non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans during 2012.•The Company’s 2012 and 2011 restructuring activities used $140 million in cash during 2012.•As of December 31, 2012, the Company held approximately $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents.Operating ActivitiesThe Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position. Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for items such as income taxes, restructuring activities, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows.48Table of ContentsOperating cash flows from continuing operations were $3.5 billion for 2012, an increase of $770 million, or 28% as compared to 2011. The year-over-year change in operating cash flows from 2011 to 2012 was primarily attributable to the following factors:•Earnings from continuing operations increased by $364 million in 2012 as compared to 2011. •Earnings for 2012 reflected an increase of $205 million of depreciation and amortization expense as compared to 2011. The increase in amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with the Beckman Coulter acquisition. The increase in depreciation expense results from the fact that a majority of the Beckman Coulter customers enter into operating-type lease arrangements for the use of the business' instrumentation and each new operating-type lease arrangement entered into increases the Company's depreciable assets. The increased depreciation and amortization expense decreases earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows.•The aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable provided $47 million in operating cash flows during 2012, a $16 million decline compared to 2011 during which these items provided $63 million in operating cash flows. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventory and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively the Company manages the cash conversion cycle, which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day it pays for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from its customers.•Cash income tax payments from continuing operations increased by $52 million during 2012 as compared to 2011. Net cash payments for income taxes from continuing operations totaled $355 million and $303 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.Operating cash flows from continuing operations were $2.7 billion for 2011, an increase of $713 million, or 35% as compared to 2010. The increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to the increase in earnings in 2011 as compared to 2010. In addition, trade accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable in the aggregate contributed $63 million of operating cash flows during 2011 as compared to using $195 million in operating cash flows during 2010. In connection with the Company’s restructuring activities, the Company records appropriate accruals for the costs of closing facilities, severing personnel and, in connection with acquisitions, integrating the acquired businesses into existing Company operations. Cash flows from operating activities are reduced by the amounts expended against the various accruals established in connection with these activities. During 2012, the Company paid $140 million related to its 2012 and 2011 restructuring activities. During 2011, the Company paid approximately $49 million related to its 2011 restructuring activities. The Company anticipates cash payments of approximately $94 million during 2013 related to its 2012 restructuring activities. Please refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about these expenditures.Investing ActivitiesCash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures and cash proceeds from divestitures of businesses or assets.Net cash used in investing activities was $1.9 billion during 2012 compared to $5.8 billion of net cash used in 2011 and $2.3 billion of net cash used in 2010.Acquisitions and Divestitures2012 Acquisitions and DivestituresFor a discussion of the Company’s 2012 acquisitions and divestitures and the pending divestiture of the Company's ownership interest in Apex, refer to “—Overview.”49Table of Contents2011 Acquisitions and DivestituresOn June 30, 2011, following the successful completion of the Company’s tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Beckman Coulter, the Company completed the acquisition of Beckman Coulter by merging one of its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries with and into Beckman Coulter such that Beckman Coulter became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Beckman Coulter develops, manufactures and markets products that simplify and automate complex biomedical testing. Beckman Coulter’s diagnostic systems are found in hospitals and other clinical settings around the world and produce information used by physicians to diagnose disease and make treatment decisions. Scientists use its life science research instruments to study complex biological problems including causes of disease and potential new therapies or drugs. Beckman Coulter had revenues of $3.7 billion in 2010, and is included in the Company’s Life Sciences & Diagnostics segment from the acquisition date. The Company recorded an aggregate of $3.7 billion of goodwill related to the acquisition of Beckman Coulter. The Company obtained control of Beckman Coulter on June 24, 2011 and, as a result, the earnings of Beckman Coulter are reflected in the Company’s results from June 25, 2011 forward.The Company paid $5.5 billion in cash (net of $450 million of cash acquired) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Beckman Coulter and assumed $1.6 billion of indebtedness in connection with the acquisition. The Company financed the acquisition of Beckman Coulter using (1) $2.3 billion of available cash, (2) net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, of $966 million from the underwritten public offering of the Company’s common stock on June 21, 2011, (3) net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, of $1.8 billion from the underwritten public offering of senior unsecured notes on June 23, 2011, and (4) net proceeds from the sale of additional commercial paper under the Company’s U.S. commercial paper program prior to the closing of the acquisition.In addition to the acquisition of Beckman Coulter, during 2011, the Company completed the acquisition of thirteen other businesses (including the acquisition of EskoArtwork, a leading full service solutions provider for the digital packaging design and production market), for total consideration of $669 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The additional businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company's five segments. The aggregate annual sales of the businesses acquired at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the acquired company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $325 million. For a discussion of the Company's April 2011 divestiture of the PSA business, please see “—Overview.” 2010 Acquisitions and Apex Joint VentureOn January 30, 2010, the Company completed the acquisition of the Analytical Technologies division of MDS Inc., which included a 50% ownership position in the AB Sciex joint venture and a 100% ownership position in Molecular Devices. In a separate but related transaction, the Company simultaneously completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership position in AB Sciex from Life Technologies Corporation. The aggregate purchase price for the combined transactions was $1.0 billion, including debt assumed and net of cash acquired. The aggregate sales of AB Sciex and Molecular Devices in their last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition were $650 million and these businesses now operate within the Company’s Life Sciences & Diagnostics segment. The acquisitions of AB Sciex and Molecular Devices significantly expanded the Company’s position in the life sciences and diagnostics business and in particular established a position in the mass spectrometry market.In addition to the acquisitions of AB Sciex and Molecular Devices, the Company acquired seventeen businesses during 2010 for aggregate consideration of approximately $1.1 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The additional businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company's five segments. The aggregate annual sales of these seventeen acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $440 million.As discussed above, on July 4, 2010, the Company entered into a joint venture with Cooper, combining certain of the Company’s hand tools businesses with Cooper’s Tools business to form a new entity called Apex. The 2010 sales, on a combined basis, of the two tools businesses contributed to Apex were approximately $1.2 billion. During the period that Cooper and the Company owned Apex, each of Cooper and the Company owned a 50% interest in Apex and had an equal number of representatives on Apex’s Board of Directors. Upon the closing of the joint venture formation, Apex simultaneously obtained a credit facility and term debt financing and used $45 million of the term debt financing to purchase from the Company certain assets of the Company’s hand tools business. In addition to the cash received for the purchase of these assets, the Company recorded a receivable from Apex of $45 million upon closing. The Company has collected all of this receivable as of December 31, 2012. As of the closing of the joint venture formation, the Company deconsolidated the financial results of its contributed businesses and began accounting for its investment in the joint venture based on the equity method of accounting. In accordance with accounting standards applicable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries, the Company 50Table of Contentsrecognized a $291 million gain ($232 million or $0.34 per diluted share on an after-tax basis) during the third quarter 2011 associated with the transaction reflecting the difference between the book value of the contributed business that was deconsolidated and the fair value of the consideration received in exchange, including the 50% interest in Apex and the cash and receivables received from Apex in connection with the transaction. As further discussed above, in February 2013, the Company and Cooper sold Apex to an unrelated third party for approximately $1.6 billion. Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development and improving information technology systems. In addition, capital expenditures are made for the manufacture of instruments that are used in operating-type lease arrangements that certain of the Company’s businesses enter into with customers. Capital expenditures totaled $458 million in 2012, $334 million in 2011 and $191 million in 2010. The increase in capital spending in 2011 and 2012 is primarily due to the acquisition of Beckman Coulter in June 2011 and the associated capitalization of instruments subject to operating-type leases through customer arrangements. In 2013, the Company expects capital spending to approximate $500 million, though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions. Financing Activities and IndebtednessCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper, common stock and debt, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, payments of principal on indebtedness, payments for repurchases of common stock and payments of dividends to shareholders. Financing activities used cash of $388 million during 2012 compared to $2.1 billion of cash provided during 2011. The year-over-year change was primarily due to the Company's repurchase of shares of its common stock at a cost of $648 million in 2012, whereas in 2011 the Company received $1.8 billion from the issuance of the 2011 Financing Notes (as defined below).Total debt was $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. The Company’s debt as of December 31, 2012 was as follows:•$1.2 billion of outstanding U.S. dollar and Euro denominated commercial paper;•$660 million (€500 million) aggregate principal amount of 4.5% guaranteed Eurobond Notes due 2013 (the “Eurobond Notes”);•$300 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2013 (the “2013 Notes”);•$400 million aggregate principal amount of 1.3% senior notes due 2014 (the “2014 Notes”);•$500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.3% senior notes due 2016 (the “2016 Notes”);•$500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2018 (the “2018 Notes”);•$750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.4% senior notes due 2019 (the “2019 Notes”);•$600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.9% senior notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes” and together with the 2013 Notes, 2014 Notes and 2016 Notes, the “2011 Financing Notes”);•$281 million of zero coupon Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2021 (“LYONs”); and•$127 million of other borrowings.The 2011 Financing Notes, the Eurobond Notes, the 2018 Notes and the 2019 Notes are collectively referred to as the “Notes”.Commercial Paper Programs and Credit FacilityThe Company satisfies any short-term liquidity needs that are not met through operating cash flow and available cash primarily through issuances of commercial paper under its U.S. and Euro commercial paper programs. Under these programs, the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes. Interest expense on the notes is paid at maturity and is generally based on the ratings assigned to the Company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to LIBOR. Borrowings under the program are available for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. During 2012, as commercial paper balances matured the Company either paid such balances from available cash or refinanced such balances by issuing new commercial paper. The Company issued commercial paper under the Euro commercial paper program during 2012 and as of December 31, 2012, $66 million (€50 million) of commercial paper was outstanding under this program. There was no commercial paper outstanding under the Euro program as of December 31, 2011 or at any other time during 2011. 51Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2012, borrowings outstanding under the Company’s U.S. and Euro commercial paper programs had a weighted average annual interest rate of 0.2% and a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately seven days. Commercial paper balances during the year carried interest at annual rates ranging between 0.1% and 0.7% and original maturities between one and thirty-six days. The Company classified its borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs as of December 31, 2012, as well as its 2013 Notes and its Eurobond Notes, as long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company had the intent and ability, as supported by availability under the Credit Facility referenced below, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date.Credit support for the commercial paper program is provided by a $2.5 billion unsecured multi-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that expires on July 15, 2016 (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Under the Credit Facility, borrowings (other than bid loans) bear interest at a rate equal to (at the Company’s option) either (1) a LIBOR-based rate plus a margin that varies according to the Company’s long-term debt credit rating (the “Eurodollar Rate”), or (2) the highest of (a) the Federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (b) the prime rate and (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1%, plus in each case a margin that varies according to the Company’s long-term debt credit rating. In addition to certain initial fees the Company paid at inception of the Credit Facility, the Company is obligated to pay an annual commitment fee that varies according to its long-term debt credit rating. The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the facility) of 0.65 to 1.00 or less, and also contains customary representations, warranties, conditions precedent, events of default, indemnities and affirmative and negative covenants. As of December 31, 2012, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Facility and the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the facility. The non-performance by any member of the Credit Facility syndicate would reduce the maximum capacity of the Credit Facility by such member's commitment amount. In addition to the Credit Facility, the Company has entered into reimbursement agreements with various commercial banks to support the issuance of letters of credit.The availability of the Credit Facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of the Company’s commercial paper program. The Company expects to limit any borrowings under the Credit Facility to amounts that would leave sufficient credit available under the facility to allow the Company to borrow, if needed, to repay all of the outstanding commercial paper as it matures.The Company’s ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related costs of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of the Company’s credit rating and market conditions. Any downgrade in the Company’s credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the Company’s commercial paper program and the Credit Facility, and could limit or preclude the Company’s ability to issue commercial paper. If the Company’s access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a downgrade, change in market conditions or otherwise, the Company would expect to rely on a combination of available cash, operating cash flow and the Company’s Credit Facility to provide short-term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under the Company’s Credit Facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings.On June 17, 2011, the Company entered into a $3.0 billion 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility (the “364-Day Facility”) in connection with the acquisition of Beckman Coulter. The Company reduced the commitments under the 364-Day Facility over the balance of the year and terminated the facility as of December 29, 2011. There were no outstanding borrowings under the 364-Day Facility at any time during the term of the facility.Other Long-Term Indebtedness2011 Financing Notes—On June 23, 2011, the Company completed the underwritten public offering of the 2011 Financing Notes, all of which are unsecured. The 2013 Notes were issued at 100% of their principal amount, will mature on June 21, 2013 and accrue interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.25% per year. The 2014 Notes were issued at 99.918% of their principal amount, will mature on June 23, 2014 and accrue interest at the rate of 1.3% per year. The 2016 Notes were issued at 99.84% of their principal amount, will mature on June 23, 2016 and accrue interest at the rate of 2.3% per year. The 2021 Notes were issued at 99.975% of their principal amount, will mature on June 23, 2021 and accrue interest at the rate of 3.9% per year. The net proceeds from the 2011 Financing Notes offering, after deducting expenses and the underwriters’ discount, were approximately $1.8 billion and were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Beckman Coulter. The Company pays interest on the 2013 Notes quarterly in arrears on March 21, June 21, September 21 and December 21 of each year. The Company pays interest on the 2014 Notes, 2016 Notes and 2021 Notes semi-annually in arrears, on June 23 and December 23 of each year.2019 Notes—In March 2009, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of the 2019 Notes, which were issued at 99.93% of their principal amount, will mature on March 1, 2019 and accrue interest at the rate of 5.4% per year. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, were approximately $745 million. A portion of the net proceeds were used to repay a portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial paper and the balance was used for general corporate 52Table of Contentspurposes, including acquisitions. The Company pays interest on the 2019 Notes semi-annually in arrears, on March 1 and September 1 of each year.2018 Notes—In December 2007, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of the 2018 Notes, which were issued at 99.39% of their principal amount, will mature on January 15, 2018 and accrue interest at the rate of 5.625% per year. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, were approximately $493 million, which were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance the acquisition of the Tektronix business. The Company pays interest on the 2018 Notes semi-annually in arrears, on January 15 and July 15 of each year.Eurobond Notes—On July 21, 2006, a financing subsidiary of the Company issued the Eurobond Notes in a private placement outside the United States. Payment obligations under these Eurobond Notes are guaranteed by the Company. The net proceeds of the offering, after the deduction of underwriting commissions but prior to the deduction of other issuance costs, were €496 million ($627 million based on exchange rates in effect at the time the offering closed) and were used to pay down a portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.LYONs—In 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in LYONs. The net proceeds to the Company were $505 million, of which approximately $100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The LYONs carry a yield to maturity of 2.375% (with contingent interest payable as described below). Holders of the LYONs may convert each $1,000 of principal amount at maturity into 29.0704 shares of the Company’s common stock (in the aggregate for all LYONs that were originally issued, approximately 24.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January 22, 2021. As of December 31, 2012, an aggregate of approximately 14 million shares of the Company’s common stock had been issued upon conversion of LYONs. As of December 31, 2012, the accreted value of the outstanding LYONs was lower than the traded market value of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time at scheduled redemption prices. Holders had the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash and/or Company common stock, at the Company’s option, on each of January 22, 2004 and January 22, 2011, which resulted in aggregate notes with an accreted value of approximately $1 million being redeemed by the Company for cash.Under the terms of the LYONs, the Company will pay contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six month period from January 23 to July 22 and from July 23 to January 22 if the average market price of a LYON for a specified measurement period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. The amount of contingent interest to be paid with respect to any quarterly period is equal to the higher of either 0.0315% of the bonds’ average market price during the specified measurement period or the amount of the common stock dividend paid during such quarterly period multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon conversion of a LYON. The Company paid $1 million of contingent interest on the LYONs for each of the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 and paid $2 million in contingent interest in 2010. Except for the contingent interest described above, the Company will not pay interest on the LYONs prior to maturity.Covenants and Redemption Provisions Applicable to the NotesThe Company may redeem some or all of the 2014 Notes, the 2016 Notes, the 2018 Notes and/or the 2019 Notes at any time by paying the principal amount and a “make-whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Prior to March 23, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), the Company may redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes by paying the principal amount and a “make-whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On or after March 23, 2021, the Company may redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes for their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. If a change of control triggering event occurs with respect to the Notes, each holder of Notes may require the Company to repurchase some or all of its Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued interest (100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of Eurobond Notes). A change of control triggering event means the occurrence of both a change of control and a rating event, each as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture or comparable instrument. Except in connection with a change of control triggering event as described above, the Company does not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt. In addition, the Company may redeem the Eurobond notes upon the occurrence of specified, adverse changes in tax laws, or interpretations under such laws, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed.The indentures and comparable instruments pursuant to which the Notes were issued each contain customary covenants including, for example, limits on the incurrence of secured debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to the Company’s operations and as of December 31, 2012, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.53Table of ContentsBeckman Coulter IndebtednessIn connection with the acquisition of Beckman Coulter in June 2011, the Company assumed indebtedness with a fair value of $1.6 billion (the “Beckman Coulter Notes”). During the third quarter of 2011, the Company retired substantially all of the Beckman Coulter Notes using proceeds from the issuance of U.S. dollar commercial paper and recorded an approximate $33 million ($21 million, after tax or $0.03 per diluted share) charge to earnings due to “make whole” payments associated with the extinguishment of certain of the Beckman Coulter Notes. The charge to earnings is reflected as loss on early extinguishment of debt in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.For additional details regarding the Company’s debt as of December 31, 2012 see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Shelf Registration StatementThe Company maintains a “well-known seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance. The Company expects to use the net proceeds from future securities sales off this shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, including without limitation reduction or refinancing of debt or other corporate obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends and working capital. In May 2012, the Company filed a new shelf registration statement to replace the shelf registration statement that was filed in May 2009 and expired in May 2012.On June 21, 2011, the Company used its then-current shelf registration statement to complete the underwritten public offering of 19,250,000 shares of Danaher common stock at a price to the public of $51.75 per share. The net proceeds, after deducting expenses and the underwriters' discount, were approximately $966 million and were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for Beckman Coulter. On June 23, 2011, the Company also used this shelf registration statement to complete the underwritten public offering of the 2011 Financing Notes. Stock Repurchase ProgramOn May 11, 2010, the Company’s Board authorized the repurchase of up to 20 million shares of the Company’s common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. There is no expiration date for the Company’s repurchase program. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased is determined by the Company’s management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Company’s equity compensation plans (or any successor plan) and for other corporate purposes. Pursuant to the stock repurchase program, during the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company repurchased approximately 12.5 million shares of Company common stock in open market transactions at a cost of $648 million. Neither the Company nor any “affiliated purchaser” repurchased any shares of Company common stock during 2011 or 2010. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had approximately 7.5 million shares remaining for stock repurchases under the existing Board authorization. The Company expects to fund any future stock repurchases using the Company's available cash balance or proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper.DividendsThe Company declared a regular dividend of $0.025 per share that was paid on December 28, 2012 to holders of record on December 14, 2012. Aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2012 were approximately $86 million. Dividend payments were higher in 2012 as compared to 2011 because the Company's Board determined to accelerate the quarterly dividend payment that normally would have been paid in January 2013 and paid it in December 2012 instead.Cash and Cash RequirementsAs of December 31, 2012, the Company held $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an approximate weighted average annual interest rate of 0.3%. $625 million of this amount was held within the United States and $1.1 billion was held outside of the United States. The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures and acquisitions, to pay interest and service debt, pay taxes, fund its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock, pay dividends to shareholders and support other business needs. The Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, particularly in connection with acquisitions, the Company may also borrow under its commercial paper 54Table of Contentsprogram or the Credit Facility, enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program and/or access the capital markets as needed. The Company also may from time to time access the capital markets to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions. With respect to the Eurobond Notes and the 2013 Notes, each of which matures in 2013, the Company expects to repay the principal amounts when due under these notes using available cash, proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and/or proceeds from other debt issuances.While repatriation of some cash held outside the United States may be restricted by local laws, most of the Company's foreign cash balances could be repatriated to the United States but, under current law, could be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. For most of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company makes an election regarding the amount of earnings intended for indefinite reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. A deferred tax liability has been accrued for the funds that are available to be repatriated to the United States. No provisions for U.S. income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, and the amount of U.S. income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the Company could employ if it repatriated these earnings. The cash that our foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments, including acquisitions. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately $9.3 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, management believes that is has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs, including its cash needs in the United States.During 2012, the Company contributed approximately $55 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan and approximately $53 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2013, the Company’s cash contribution requirements for its U.S. defined benefit pension plan are not expected to be significant and the Company’s cash contribution requirements for its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately $52 million. The ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan’s funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates and other factors.Contractual ObligationsThe following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations relating to continuing operations as of December 31, 2012 under (1) long-term debt obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company’s balance sheet under GAAP. The amounts presented in the table below do not reflect $592 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits.

Interest on long-term debt and capital lease obligations is reflected in a separate line in the table.(c) Interest payments on long-term debt are projected for future periods using the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2012. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates.55Table of Contents(d) As described in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain leases require the Company to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises. These future costs are not included in the schedule above.(e) Consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction.(f) Primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies and allowances, performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs, self-insurance and litigation claims, post-retirement benefits, pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities (excluding unrecognized tax benefits) and deferred compensation obligations. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management’s estimates over the terms of these arrangements and is largely based upon historical experience.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of off-balance sheet commitments of the Company as of December 31, 2012. Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period($ in millions)Total AmountsCommitted Less ThanOne Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than5 YearsGuarantees$355.4 $286.4 $39.0 $12.7 $17.3Guarantees consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit, bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds. These guarantees have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors, customers, financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure the Company’s obligations and/or performance requirements related to specific transactions.Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters or tax matters. The Company has not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they relate to unknown conditions and the Company cannot estimate the potential liabilities from such matters, but the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. In addition, as a result of these divestitures, as well as restructuring activities, certain properties leased by the Company have been sublet to third parties. In the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by such sub-lessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the Company’s financial statements.In the normal course of business, the Company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers, suppliers or other business partners for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the Company’s products or claims alleging that Company products infringe third-party intellectual property. The Company has not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual commitments table above. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations.The Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the Company, or by reason of serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to limited exceptions. Danaher’s Amended and Restated By-laws provide for similar indemnification rights. In addition, Danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of Danaher Corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which Danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding. While the Company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage.56Table of ContentsLegal ProceedingsPlease refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding certain litigation matters.In addition to the litigation matters noted under “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters – Environmental, Health & Safety”, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Company’s products and services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, personal injury and insurance coverage. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, divested businesses. Some of these lawsuits may include claims for punitive and consequential, as well as compensatory damages. Based upon the Company’s experience, current information and applicable law, it does not believe it is reasonably possible that these proceedings and claims will have a material effect on its financial statements.While the Company maintains general, products, property, workers’ compensation, automobile, cargo, aviation, crime, fiduciary and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (and has acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions) up to certain limits that cover certain of these claims, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses. For general, products and property liability and most other insured risks, the Company purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses (“stop loss” insurance) and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to amounts within the self-insured retention. In addition, while the Company believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims, these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses.In accordance with accounting guidance, the Company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss does not meet the known or probable level but is reasonably possible and a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. The Company's reserves consist of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts for anticipated developments of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims. The specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified with the assistance of legal counsel and outside risk professionals where appropriate. In addition, outside risk professionals assist in the determination of reserves for incurred but not yet reported claims through evaluation of the Company’s specific loss history, actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors. Reserve estimates are adjusted as additional information regarding a claim becomes known. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including litigation developments, the discovery of new facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. While the Company actively pursues financial recoveries from insurance providers, it does not recognize any recoveries until realized or until such time as a sustained pattern of collections is established related to historical matters of a similar nature and magnitude. If the Company’s self-insurance and litigation reserves prove inadequate, it would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s net earnings. Please see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the amount of our accruals for self-insurance and litigation liability.For a discussion of additional risks related to legal proceedings, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESManagement’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience, the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments.The Company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to Note 1 in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.57Table of ContentsAccounts Receivable. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect probable credit losses inherent in its portfolio of receivables. Determination of the allowances requires management to exercise judgment about the timing, frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the allowances for doubtful accounts and, therefore, net income. The allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s best estimate of the credit losses expected from the Company’s trade accounts, contract and finance receivable portfolios based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience. The level of the allowances is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors including historical loss experience by receivable type, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic conditions and credit risk quality. The Company regularly performs detailed reviews of its accounts receivable portfolio to determine if an impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowances. Additions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are charged to current period earnings; amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowances, while amounts recovered on accounts previously determined to be uncollectible increase the allowances. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required and net earnings would be adversely impacted.Inventories. The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market value. The Company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand, technological advances and pricing competition in many of the Company’s markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the Company’s control. As a result, such fluctuations can be difficult to predict. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, the Company could be required to reduce the value of its inventory, which would adversely impact the Company’s financial statements.Acquired Intangibles. The Company’s business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill, in-process research and development (""IPR&D"") and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the Company may incur. The Company does not amortize goodwill but does amortize certain identifiable intangible assets, primarily customer relationships and acquired technology, over the estimated useful life of the identified asset. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and is subject to annual impairment reviews or more often upon the occurrence of certain events. When the IPR&D project is complete, the asset is reclassified as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized over the asset's estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, an impairment loss equal to the value of the intangible asset is recorded in the period of abandonment.During 2012, accounting guidance became effective that simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment. The guidance permits the Company to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. Alternatively, the Company may decide to proceed directly to the two-step goodwill impairment test. The Company may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. For 2012, the Company elected to bypass the optional qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative impairment test for all reporting units as this was determined to be the most efficient method to assess for impairment across a large spectrum of reporting units. On an annual basis (the first day of the Company’s fiscal fourth quarter) the Company quantitatively estimates the fair value of each of its reporting units and compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company must perform additional analysis to determine if the reporting unit’s goodwill has been impaired. If circumstances or events prior to the date of the required annual assessment indicate that, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that there has been diminution of fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value, the Company performs an impairment analysis at the time of such circumstance or event. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market based approach. The Company estimates fair value based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) multiples determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the Company’s reporting units, in addition to recent market available precedent transactions of comparable businesses. In evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach, management assesses the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data. In certain circumstances the Company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (i.e., an income approach) in order to validate the results of the market approach. The discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company must perform additional analysis to determine if the reporting unit's goodwill has been impaired. 58Table of ContentsWhile the Company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units, if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings.As of December 31, 2012, the Company had twenty-one reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. The carrying value of the goodwill included in each individual reporting unit ranges from $7 million to $3.9 billion. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2012 indicated that in all instances, the fair value of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 27% to approximately 804%. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this hypothetical 10% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 15% to approximately 714%. Reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment. Management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units decreases as these businesses are integrated into the Company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth.Contingent Liabilities. As discussed above under “—Legal Proceedings”, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors, including those discussed above under “—Legal Proceedings”. If the reserves established by the Company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s financial statements.Revenue Recognition: The Company derives revenues from the sale of products and services. For revenue related to a product or service to qualify for recognition, there must be persuasive evidence of a sale, delivery must have occurred or the services must have been rendered, the price to the customer must be fixed and determinable and collectability of the balance must be reasonably assured. Refer to Note 1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s revenue recognition policies. Although most of the Company’s sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, certain agreements contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. As a result, judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for sales recognition purposes, and, if so, how the sales price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize sales for each element. For fiscal 2011 and future periods, revenues for contractual arrangements consisting of multiple elements (i.e. deliverables) are recognized for the separate elements when the product or services that are part of the multiple element arrangement have value on a stand-alone basis and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in the Company’s control. The Company allocates revenue to each element in the contractual arrangement based on a selling price hierarchy that, in some instances, may require the Company to estimate the selling price of certain deliverables that are not sold on a stand-alone basis or where third party evidence of pricing is not observable. The Company’s estimate of selling price impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements. For transactions entered into prior to fiscal year 2011, revenue for multiple element arrangements was recognized for the separate elements when the product or services that are part of the multiple element arrangement had value on a stand-alone basis, fair value of the separate elements exists (or in the case of software related products, vendor specific objective evidence of fair value) and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element was considered probable and substantially in the Company’s control. A portion of the Company’s revenues relate to lease payment arrangements, which require the Company to evaluate whether to account for the arrangement as an operating or sales type lease. Certain of the Company’s lease contracts are customized for larger customers and often result in complex terms and conditions that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criteria.Stock-Based Compensation: The Company accounts for stock-based compensation by measuring the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted, including stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted shares, based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date. For a description of the Company’s stock-based compensation accounting practices, refer to Note 17 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards require subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the awards and stock price volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent the Company’s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application 59Table of Contentsof management judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company uses different assumptions, the Company’s equity-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. If the Company’s actual forfeiture rate during a reporting period is materially different than its estimate, the Company’s earnings may be significantly impacted as the Company records the effect of actual experience in the period it occurs.Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits: Certain of the Company’s employees and retired employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans (“pension plans”) and certain eligible retirees are entitled to health care and life insurance benefits under post-retirement benefit plans (“post-retirement plans”). The Company measures its pension and post retirement plans’ assets and obligations as of the end of each year to determine the funded status of each plan. The Company recognizes an asset for a plan’s overfunded status or a liability for a plan’s underfunded status in its balance sheet. Changes in the funded status of the plans are recognized in the year in which the changes occur and are reported in comprehensive income. Accounting standards require that the amounts the Company records, including the expense or income, associated with the pension and post-retirement plans be computed using actuarial valuations. For a description of the Company's pension benefit accounting practices, refer to Notes 11 and 12 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.Calculations of the amount of pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations, including assumptions regarding discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rates of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. Upon the sale of the KEO business during 2012, the Danaher U.S. defined benefit pension plan became fully frozen and plan participants are therefore no longer accruing benefits under this plan. In connection with this triggering event, the Company updated the loss amortization period for actuarial gains and losses in the plan to record them over the remaining life expectancy of the plan participants, rather than over the average future working lifetime of the plan participants as had been the case before the plan became fully frozen. In addition, the Company updated the mortality assumptions used to estimate the projected benefit obligation to reflect updated mortality tables which extend the life expectancy of the participants. The impact of these changes will reduce pension expense in 2013 by $29 million compared to what would have been recorded had these changes not been made. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other post-retirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate, changes in the assumptions (as a result of differences in actual experience, changes in key economic indicators or other factors) the Company’s financial statements could be materially impacted. A 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the U.S. net obligation by $158 million ($99 million on an after tax basis) and the non-U.S. net obligation by $106 million ($79 million on an after tax basis) from the amounts recorded in the financial statements at December 31, 2012.For 2012, the expected long-term rate of return assumption applicable to assets held in the U.S. plan has been estimated at 7.50%. This expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected long-term returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets. The U.S. plan targets to invest between 60% and 70% of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments. The balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in bond funds. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2012 was reduced by 50 basis points, pension expense for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans for 2012 would have increased $12 million (or $8 million on an after-tax basis). The Company intends to use an expected long-term rate of return assumption of 7.5% for 2013 for its U.S. plan. The Company’s non-U.S. plan assets consist of various insurance contracts, equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan. The estimated long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 1.25% to 7.10%.For a discussion of the Company’s 2012 and anticipated 2013 defined benefit pension plan contributions, please see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash and Cash Requirements”.Income Taxes: The Company’s income tax expense represents the current tax liability for the year and the tax benefit or expense for the net change in deferred tax liabilities and assets during the year. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the Company’s tax return in future years for which the tax benefit has already been reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. For a description of the Company's income tax accounting policies, refer to Note 1 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances. The determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding: (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies, and can also be impacted by changes to tax laws. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items that have already been taken as a deduction on the 60Table of ContentsCompany’s tax return but have not yet been recognized as an expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date.The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon the technical merits, it is “more-likely-than-not” that the position will be sustained upon examination. Judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions. The Company generally re-evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and recognizes an uncertain tax benefit when: (i) there is completion of tax audit; (ii) there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (iii) there is an expiration of the statute of limitations.An increase in our nominal tax rate of 1.0% would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 of approximately $30 million.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSIn February 2013, updated accounting guidance was issued which adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The guidance does not amend any existing requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements. This guidance is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012, with early adoption permitted. As this new guidance is related to presentation only, the implementation of this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 will not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.In July 2012, updated accounting guidance was issued which allows entities to perform a qualitative assessment by applying a more likely than not scenario (defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to determine whether an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. The guidance is effective for indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012, with early adoption permitted. The implementation of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.ITEM 7A.

We make available free of charge on the website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material with, or furnishing such material to, the SEC. Our Internet site and the information contained on or connected to that site are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.16Table of ContentsITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Conditions in the global economy, the markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our business is sensitive to general economic conditions and since 2008 the effects of the global financial crisis have adversely impacted the global economy. Slower global economic growth, the credit market crisis and European debt crisis, uncertainty relating to the Euro, high levels of unemployment, reduced levels of capital expenditures, changes in government fiscal and monetary policies, government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics, sequestration, other austerity measures and other challenges affecting the global economy adversely affect the Company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, including having the effect of:•reducing demand for our products (in this Item 1A, references to products also includes software) and services, limiting the financing available to our customers and suppliers, increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies;•increasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories;•increasing price competition in our served markets; •supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; •increasing the risk of impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets; and•increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which, in addition to increasing the risks identified above, could result in preference actions against us.Although we have been able to continue accessing the commercial paper and other capital markets through the date of this report, there can be no assurances that such markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations.Improvement in the global economy remains uneven and uncertain. If slower growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve continues for a significant period, if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy don't benefit the markets we serve, our business and financial statements could be adversely affected. Our restructuring actions could have long-term adverse effects on our business. From 2008 through 2013, we have implemented multiple, significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. These restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities (including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses) reduce our available talent, assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases. These circumstances could adversely impact our business and financial statements.Our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve, and visibility into our markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial 17Table of Contentsstatements. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers' capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies, and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities. Demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in incentive programs, new product introductions and customer inventory levels. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period.We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share. Even if we compete effectively, we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services. Our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. Because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors; please see “Item 1. Business - Competition” for additional details. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets, including high-growth markets. Our failure to compete effectively and/or pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements, and our expansion into new markets may result in greater-than-expected risks, liabilities and expenses.Our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation.We generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis, our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer. Our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to:•correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;•allocate our research and development funding to products and services with higher growth prospects;•anticipate and respond to our competitors' development of new products and services and technological innovations;•differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings and avoid commoditization;•innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third party technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets;•obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies before our competitors do;•successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time;•obtain necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope, including with respect to medical device products by demonstrating satisfactory clinical results where applicable; and•stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies.In addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. In addition, promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes or uncertainty over third party reimbursement.Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit 18Table of Contentscompanies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, though we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, material violations of such standards of conduct could occur. Any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price.Our ability to grow revenues, earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies. We may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price. Promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including high valuations, competition among prospective buyers, the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms. In addition, competition for acquisitions may result in higher purchase prices. Changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions. Our acquisition of businesses, joint ventures and strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements.As part of our business strategy we acquire businesses and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course, some of which may be material; please see “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) for additional details. These acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our financial statements: •Any acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it, or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable.•We may incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic relationships.•Acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic relationships could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in any given period, or over the long-term.•Pre-closing and post-closing earnings charges could adversely impact operating results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period to period.•Acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic relationships could create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address.•We could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other systems and retaining key employees and customers.•We may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition, joint venture or strategic relationship.•We may assume by acquisition, joint venture or strategic relationship unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company's activities. The realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations.•In connection with acquisitions and joint ventures, we often enter into post-closing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments, earn-out obligations and indemnification obligations, which may have unpredictable financial results.•As a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet. If we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets. 19Table of Contents•We may have interests that diverge from those of our joint venture partners or other strategic partners and we may not be able to direct the management and operations of the joint venture or other strategic relationship in the manner we believe is most appropriate, exposing us to additional risk. The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements.Divestitures could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements. We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. Divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business. For example, when we decide to sell a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not become satisfied. In addition, divestitures may dilute the Company's earnings per share, have other adverse accounting impacts and distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. In addition, we have retained responsibility for and/or have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.Certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. FDA and by comparable agencies of other countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information. Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements.Certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the U.S. FDA, by comparable agencies of other countries and regions and by regulations governing radioactive or other hazardous materials (or the manufacture and sale of products containing such materials). We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approvals (such as 510(k) clearance) for our new products or modifications to (or additional indications or uses of) existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be time-consuming, costly and subject to restrictions. Our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors, for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results, and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained. Failure to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products (or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products), other violations of these regulations, efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products (even after obtaining clearance for distribution) and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to FDA Form 483 Inspectional Observations, warning letters, notices to customers, declining sales, loss of customers, loss of market share, recalls, seizures of adulterated or misbranded products, injunctions, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, narrowing of permitted uses for a product, suspension or withdrawal of approvals and pre-market notification rescissions. We are also subject to various laws regulating (1) fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, and (2) the privacy and security of health information, including the federal regulations described in “Item 1 - Business - Regulatory Matters.” Many states and foreign countries have also adopted laws and regulations similar to, and in some cases more stringent than, such federal regulations. For more information regarding regulations we are subject to please see “Item 1 - Business - Regulatory Matters.” Failure to comply with the regulations described above could result in the adverse effects referenced below under “Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation.” Compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses. 20Table of ContentsThe healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, which could adversely affect our financial statements.The healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, including the following:•Many of our customers, and the end-users to whom our customers supply products, rely on government funding of and reimbursement for healthcare products and services and research activities. The U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “PPACA”), healthcare austerity measures in Europe and other potential healthcare reform changes and government austerity measures may reduce the amount of government funding or reimbursement available to customers or end-users of our products and services and/or the volume of medical procedures using our products and services. Global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement.•The PPACA imposes a 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the U.S. as well as reporting and disclosure requirements on medical device manufacturers.•Governmental and private healthcare providers and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the delivery of healthcare services, forming group purchasing organizations to improve their purchasing leverage and using competitive bid processes to procure healthcare products and services.These changes have increased our tax liabilities and may cause participants in the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services, reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products services from governmental agencies or third party payors, reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services and increase our compliance and other costs. In addition, we may be unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us, and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability. All of the factors described above could adversely affect our financial statements.Our operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements.Our operations, products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use, generation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the U.S. and abroad in connection with our operations. We cannot assure you that our environmental, health and safety compliance program has been or will at all times be effective. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements. In addition, we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. We may also become subject to additional remedial, compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules. For additional information regarding these risks, please refer to “Item 1. Business - Regulatory Matters.” We cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. However, based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2013 will have a material effect on our financial statements.21Table of ContentsOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation.In addition to the environmental, health, safety, healthcare, medical device, anticorruption and other regulations noted above, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the federal, state, local and other jurisdictional levels, including the following:•We are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons and dealings between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory.•We also have agreements to sell products and services to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with government entities. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. Our agreements with government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification at the convenience of the government or in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors, and we may underestimate our costs of performing under the contract. Government contracts that have been awarded to us following a bid process could become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder, which could result in loss of the contract. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts. These are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. The regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. We, our representatives and the industries in which we operate may at times be under review and/or investigation by regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and any such failure (or becoming subject to a regulatory enforcement investigation) could also damage to our reputation, disrupt our business, limit our ability to manufacture, import, export and sell products and services, result in loss of customers and disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. Compliance with these and other regulations may also affect our returns on investment or require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model. Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the International Standards Organization, and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our financial statements. For additional information regarding these risks, please refer to “Item 1. Business - Regulatory Matters.”We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.As of December 31, 2013, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $22.3 billion. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized. Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements.Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products and services we purchase overseas. Sales and expenses of our non-U.S. businesses are also translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects. In addition, certain of our businesses may invoice customers in a currency other than the business' functional currency, and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable translation effects. The Company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries.22Table of ContentsChanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Please see the MD&A for a discussion of the factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period. The impact of these factors may be substantially different from period to period. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities, such as the audits described in the MD&A and the Company's financial statements. Due to the potential for changes to tax laws (or the interpretation thereof) and the ambiguity of tax laws, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our intercompany arrangements and other factors, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. If these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected. If we determine to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have been considered permanently re-invested under existing accounting standards, it could also increase our effective tax rate. In addition, any significant change to the tax system in the U.S. or in other jurisdictions, including changes in the taxation of international income, could adversely affect our financial statements.We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements.We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiture-related matters. These lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. In addition, developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. We cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation. However, based on our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2013 will have a material effect on our financial statements.If we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our business. The intellectual property rights that we obtain, however, may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. In addition, the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented or designed-around, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons, or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements.23Table of ContentsThird parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.From time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. Any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to critical technology, be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services, be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements. Even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our financial statements. Defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products (including software) or services could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.Manufacturing or design defects or ""bugs"" in, unanticipated use of, safety or quality issues with respect to, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products (including software) and services that we make or sell (including products, components or software that we source from third parties) can lead to personal injury, death, property damage or other liability. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts, result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us. Recalls, removals and product liability and similar claims can result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services.The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products, our reputation, business and financial statements could suffer.The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters and environmental factors, and if not discovered before the product is released to market could result in recalls and product liability exposure. Because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities, an alternative manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity. Any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant costs and liability, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products.Our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow, and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements.As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately $3.5 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, based on the availability under our credit facilities as of December 31, 2013, we had the ability to incur an additional $2.1 billion of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facilities. Our debt level and related debt service obligations can have negative consequences, including (1) requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and capital investment; (2) reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and (3) exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. We may incur significantly more debt in the future, particularly to finance acquisitions. Our current revolving credit facility and long-term debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us; for more information please refer to the MD&A. If we breach any of these restrictions and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements. In addition, any failure to maintain the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies would adversely affect our cost of funds and could adversely affect our liquidity and access to the capital markets. If we add new debt, the risks described above could increase.24Table of ContentsAdverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition, performance, purchasing patterns or inventory levels of, key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements.Certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and end-users. Some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors' products or compete with us directly, and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. Adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners, or adverse developments in their financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns, could adversely affect our financial statements. The levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners, and changes in those levels, can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period. In addition, the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries could adversely impact our profitability.Our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations.As discussed in “Item 1. Business - Materials,” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components, raw materials and other commodities. Prices for and availability of these components, raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past. Any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business. In addition, due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve, the cost-containment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to, if commodity prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions, or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs, we could experience lower margins and profitability and our financial statements could be adversely affected. In addition, the 2012 rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission requiring public companies to disclose sourcing and other information regarding specified minerals (“conflict minerals”) may adversely affect the availability and pricing of certain of these minerals and increase our compliance costs.If we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand, our profitability may suffer. In addition, our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials, components and services could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies.We purchase materials, components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations. Our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations, including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality. During a market upturn, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices. If we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand, we may not be able to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed, our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities. Conversely, in order to secure supplies for the production of products, we sometimes enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer.In addition, some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers (including freight carriers) for reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. If these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, terrorist actions, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes. Any of these factors could result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies.Because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements. Any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our profitability.Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses. We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as regulations governing health and safety, the environment, food and drugs, privacy and electronic communications. We develop, configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. Any 25Table of Contentssignificant change in any of these regulations could reduce demand for, increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services. In addition, in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations. In these markets, the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations, or the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address, could adversely affect demand. In addition, regulatory deadlines may result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period to period.Work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations. We have a number of U.S. collective bargaining units and various non-U.S. collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our productivity, results of operations and reputation. International economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements. In 2013, approximately 58% of our sales were derived from customers outside the U.S. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located outside the U.S. Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the U.S. and increase the localization of our products and services, we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the U.S., particularly in the high-growth markets. Our international business (and particularly our business in high-growth markets) is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations, including:•interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers; •differences in terms of sale, including payment terms;•local product preferences and product requirements;•changes in a country's or region's political or economic conditions (including safety and health issues and actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt);•trade protection measures and import or export restrictions and requirements;•unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including negative changes in tax laws;•limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash;•the potential for nationalization of enterprises;•changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs;•limitations on legal rights and our ability to enforce such rights;•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;•differing labor regulations;•difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis; and•differing protection of intellectual property.Any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and growth.If we suffer loss to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed.Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, public health crisis, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. If any of these facilities, supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses. The third party insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses.26Table of ContentsA significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. These systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. In addition, security breaches of our systems (or the systems of our customers, suppliers or other business partners) could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers. Like many multinational corporations, our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent. Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers' intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements.The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets, investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements. In addition, upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare coverage to current employees and retirees may increase our future funding obligations and adversely affect our financial statements.ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNot applicable.ITEM 2. PROPERTIESOur corporate headquarters are located in Washington, D.C. in a facility that we lease. As of December 31, 2013, we had facilities in over 50 countries, including approximately 254 significant manufacturing and distribution facilities. 131 of these facilities are located in the United States in over 25 states and 123 are located outside the United States in over 30 other countries, primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia, the rest of North America, South America and Australia. These facilities cover approximately 23.7 million square feet, of which approximately 13.5 million square feet are owned and approximately 10.2 million square feet are leased. Particularly outside the United States, facilities often serve more than one business segment and may be used for multiple purposes, such as administration, sales, manufacturing, warehousing and/or distribution. The number of significant facilities by business segment is:•Test & Measurement, 40;•Environmental, 45;•Life Sciences & Diagnostics, 79;•Dental, 31; and•Industrial Technologies, 59.We consider our facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used and do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. We believe our properties and equipment have been well-maintained. Please refer to Note 16 in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information with respect to our lease commitments.ITEM 3.

MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIESOur common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol DHR. As of February 10, 2014, there were approximately 3,486 holders of record of our common stock. The high and low common stock prices per share as reported on the New York Stock Exchange, and the dividends paid per share, in each case for the periods described below, were as follows: 2013 2012 High Low DividendsPer Share High Low DividendsPer ShareFirst quarter$62.90 $56.17 $—(1)$55.92 $48.24 $0.025Second quarter$64.80 $57.61 $0.025 $55.99 $49.75 $0.025Third quarter$70.94 $63.16 $0.025 $55.61 $49.48 $0.025Fourth quarter$77.39 $66.83 $0.025 $56.80 $51.39 $0.050(1) The Company made no cash payments for dividends during the first quarter of 2013 because the Company's Board had determined to accelerate the quarterly dividend payment that normally would have been paid in January 2013 and paid it in December 2012.Our payment of dividends in the future will be determined by our Board of Directors and will depend on business conditions, our earnings and other factors. In February 2014, our Board of Directors increased Danaher's quarterly dividend by declaring a dividend of $0.10 per share payable on April 25, 2014 to shareholders of record on March 28, 2014. Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesNeither the Company nor any “affiliated purchaser” repurchased any shares of Company common stock during 2013. On July 16, 2013, the Company's Board of Directors approved a repurchase program (the “2013 Repurchase Program”) authorizing the repurchase of up to 20 million shares of the Company's common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The 2013 Repurchase Program replaced the repurchase program approved by the Company's Board of Directors in May 2010 (the “2010 Repurchase Program”). There is no expiration date for the 2013 Repurchase Program, and the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will be determined by the Company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The 2013 Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Company's equity compensation plans (or any successor plan) and for other corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2013, 20 million shares remained available for repurchase pursuant to the 2013 Repurchase Program.Recent Issuances of Unregistered SecuritiesDuring the fourth quarter of 2013, holders of certain of the Company’s Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2021 (“LYONs”) converted such LYONs into an aggregate of 215,408 shares of Danaher common stock, par value $0.01 per share.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide a reader of Danaher’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of Company management. The Company’s MD&A is divided into five sections:•Overview•Results of Operations•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Critical Accounting Estimates•New Accounting StandardsOVERVIEWGeneralPlease see “Item 1. Business – General” for a discussion of Danaher’s objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value. Danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations. During 2013, approximately 58% of Danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the United States. As a diversified, global business, Danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors. Danaher’s geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of its products and services, typically helps limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results. Given the broad range of products manufactured, software and services provided and geographies served, management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the Company. The Company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.As a result of the Company’s geographic and industry diversity, the Company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges, including rapid technological development (particularly with respect to computing, mobile connectivity, communications and digitization) in most of the Company’s served markets, the expansion and evolution of opportunities in high-growth markets, trends and costs associated with a global labor force, consolidation of the Company’s competitors and increasing regulation. The Company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and the Company’s long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in high-growth geographies and high-growth market segments, identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative and differentiated new products, services and software with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of the Company’s sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment. The Company is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources (particularly in high-growth markets) in order to be responsive to the Company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the Company’s operations. Business Performance and OutlookWhile differences exist among the Company’s businesses, on an overall basis, demand for the Company’s products, software and services increased in 2013 compared to 2012 resulting in aggregate year-over-year sales growth from existing businesses. In addition, the Company’s continued investments in sales growth initiatives and the other business-specific factors discussed below contributed to year-over-year sales growth. Geographically, year-over-year sales growth rates from existing businesses during 2013 were led primarily by the high-growth markets. Sales from existing businesses in high-growth markets grew at a high-single digit rate in 2013 compared to 2012 and represented approximately 26% of the Company's total sales in 2013. Sales from existing businesses in developed markets grew at a low-single digit rate compared to 2012 and were driven by North America and Japan, which grew at low-single digit rates in 2013 partially offset by slight year-over-year contraction in Western Europe. Western Europe did grow slightly in the second half of 2013 on a year-over-year basis. The Company expects overall market conditions to remain challenging due to macro-economic uncertainties and monetary and fiscal policies of countries where we do business. While individual businesses and end markets continue to experience volatility, the Company expects sales from existing businesses to grow on a year-over-year basis during 2014 with sales growth returning to the Industrial Technologies segment and the other segments growing at rates similar to those experienced in 2013.31Table of ContentsRestructuring ActivitiesIn light of the continuing uncertainties in the macro-economic environment and consistent with the Company's approach of positioning itself to provide superior products and services to its customers in a cost efficient manner, in July 2013 the Company initiated actions to improve productivity and reduce costs in the Company's businesses. The actions, which were substantially completed by December 31, 2013, resulted in pre-tax charges of over $100 million, the majority of which was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2013. The charges, including both employee-related termination costs as well as other termination and exit costs, are expected to result in savings of approximately $75 million in 2014 compared to 2013 expense levels.In addition, the Company incurred $123 million of costs associated with restructuring activities in 2012 which resulted in savings of approximately $90 million in 2013 compared to 2012 expense levels. AcquisitionsDuring 2013, the Company acquired fourteen businesses for total consideration of $957 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of the Industrial Technologies, Life Sciences & Diagnostics, Environmental and Test & Measurement segments. The aggregate annual sales of these fourteen businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $300 million. For a discussion of the Company’s 2012 and 2011 acquisition activity, refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Investing Activities”.Sale of InvestmentsDuring 2010, the Company entered into a joint venture with Cooper Industries, plc (“Cooper”), combining certain of the Company’s hand tool businesses with Cooper’s Tools business to form a new entity called Apex Tool Group, LLC (“Apex”). In February 2013, the Company and Cooper sold Apex to an unrelated third party for approximately $1.6 billion. The Company received $797 million from the sale, consisting of cash of $759 million (including $67 million of dividends received prior to closing) and a note receivable of $38 million. The Company recognized an after-tax gain of $144 million or $0.20 per diluted share in connection with this transaction. As of December 31, 2013, the Company had collected the majority of this note receivable. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company sold approximately 5 million of the approximately 8 million shares of Align Technology, Inc. (""Align"") common stock that the Company received in 2009 as a result of a settlement between Align and Ormco Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company received cash proceeds of $251 million from the sale of these securities and recorded a pre-tax gain of $202 million ($125 million after-tax or $0.18 per diluted share).RESULTS OF OPERATIONSConsolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 4.5% compared to 2012. Sales from existing businesses contributed 2.5% growth and sales from acquired businesses contributed 2.5% growth on a year-over-year basis. The impact of currency translation reduced reported sales by 0.5% as the U.S. dollar was, on average, stronger against other major currencies during 2013 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2012. Consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 13.5% compared to 2011. Sales from existing businesses contributed 2.5% growth and sales from acquired businesses contributed 13.0% growth on a year-over-year basis. The impact of currency translation reduced reported sales by 2.0% as the U.S. dollar was, on average, stronger against other major currencies during 2012 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2011. In this report, references to sales from existing businesses refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) but excluding (1) sales from acquired businesses and (2) the impact of currency translation. References to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to GAAP sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the impact from the divestiture of a product line, the sales from which (prior to the divestiture) were included in sales from acquired businesses. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses) and (b) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. Sales from existing businesses should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting the non-GAAP financial measure of sales from existing businesses provides useful information to investors by 32Table of Contentshelping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with our performance in prior and future periods and to our peers. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from sales from existing businesses because currency translation is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions and related items because the nature, size and number of such transactions can vary dramatically from period to period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. References to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales.Operating profit margins were 17.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 17.3% in 2012. The factors discussed below impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. 2013 vs. 2012 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by: •Higher 2013 sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2012 and 2013, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments - 80 basis points 2013 vs. 2012 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by: •The incremental net dilutive effect of acquired businesses in 2013 - 40 basis points •The divestiture of the Apex joint venture in 2013. Prior to the sale, the Company had accounted for its investment in Apex under the equity method - 40 basis points•The fourth quarter 2013 impairment of intangible assets associated with a technology investment in the communications business - 15 basis points •A 2012 gain relating to the resolution of contingencies with respect to a prior disposition of assets - 5 basis pointsOperating profit margins were 17.3% for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to 16.3% in 2011. The factors discussed below impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. 2012 vs. 2011 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:•Higher 2012 sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and ongoing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2011 and 2012, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments - 100 basis points •Acquisition related charges recorded in 2011 associated with the Beckman Coulter acquisition, including transaction costs deemed significant, change in control charges and fair value adjustments to acquisition related inventory and deferred revenue balances - 100 basis points•A 2012 gain relating to the resolution of contingencies with respect to a prior disposition of assets - 5 basis points2012 vs. 2011 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:•The incremental net dilutive effect of acquired businesses in 2012 - 105 basis points The Company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant (generally relating to the Company’s larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for the Company in a given period.Business SegmentsThe following table summarizes sales by business segment for each of the periods indicated ($ in millions): For the Year Ended December 31 2013 2012 2011Test & Measurement$3,417.3 $3,381.0 $3,390.9Environmental3,316.9 3,063.5 2,939.6Life Sciences & Diagnostics6,856.4 6,485.1 4,627.4Dental2,094.9 2,022.9 2,011.2Industrial Technologies3,432.5 3,307.9 3,121.4Total$19,118.0 $18,260.4 $16,090.533Table of ContentsTEST & MEASUREMENTThe Company’s Test & Measurement segment is a leading global provider of electronic measurement instruments, professional test tools, thermal imaging and calibration equipment used in electrical, industrial, electronic and calibration applications.

Decreased demand in the North American, European and Chinese end markets contributed to the decline in sales. However, the Company did see demand stabilize during the second half of 2013 as compared to the first half of 2013, particularly in Europe and North America. Sales in the segment's communications businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2013 compared to 2012 with robust year-over-year increase in demand for network security and analysis solutions. Geographically, strong year-over-year demand in the North America and Latin America regions was somewhat offset by declines in demand in Asia. Operating profit margins declined 110 basis points during 2013 as compared to 2012. The favorable impacts of higher operating profit margin communication business products comprising a higher percentage of sales in 2013 compared to 2012 and lower year-over-year costs for restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives were offset by lower year-over-year instrument sales volumes and incremental year-over-year costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments. In addition, 2013 vs. 2012 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by: •The fourth quarter 2013 impairment of intangible assets associated with a technology investment in the communications business - 90 basis points•The incremental net dilutive effect of acquired businesses in 2013 - 20 basis points 34Table of Contents2012 COMPARED TO 2011 Price increases in the segment contributed 0.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2012 as compared to 2011 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.Sales in the segment's instrument businesses declined at a high-single digit rate during 2012 as compared to 2011, as lower demand for most product categories more than offset modest sales increases of service solutions. Instrument demand was weak in all major geographies although the North American market showed improvement in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to the results reported during the first nine months of 2012. Europe and Japan continued to remain weak in the fourth quarter of 2012. Sales in the segment's communications businesses grew at a high-single digit rate during 2012 compared to 2011 with strong growth in North America and Western Europe in the first six months of 2012 moderating in the second half of 2012 due primarily to project timing and difficult prior year comparisons. Demand for network management solutions and, to a lesser extent, core network enterprise solutions drove the 2012 growth. Operating profit margins declined 150 basis points during 2012 as compared to 2011. Year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons were adversely impacted by 120 basis points as lower instrument sales volumes and incremental year-over-year costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments more than offset the favorable impacts of increased sales volumes of higher operating profit margin communication business products and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with ongoing productivity improvement initiatives, including the restructuring actions taken in 2012 and 2011. The incremental net dilutive effect of acquired businesses adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 30 basis points.ENVIRONMENTALDanaher’s Environmental segment provides products that help protect the water supply and air quality by serving two primary markets: water quality and retail/commercial petroleum.

Sales from existing businesses in the business’ chemical treatment solutions product line also grew on a year-over-year basis due primarily to continued sales force investments in the U.S. market, and to a lesser extent, continued international expansion. Sales from existing businesses in the business' ultraviolet water disinfection product line declined during 2013 due to continued weak demand in municipal end markets, primarily in North America and Western Europe. Sales from existing businesses in the segment's retail petroleum equipment businesses grew at a low-single digit rate during 2013 as compared to 2012. Demand for the businesses' dispenser and retail automation products was particularly strong in Western Europe, Asia and the Middle East. On a year-over-year basis, the business experienced strong increase in demand for its point-of-sale and payment systems and continued growth in demand for dispensers, which were partially offset by slight declines in demand for services. Operating profit margins declined 30 basis points during 2013 as compared to 2012. The factors discussed below impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. 2013 vs. 2012 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:•Higher 2013 sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2012 and 2013, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments - 70 basis points2013 vs. 2012 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by: •The incremental net dilutive effect of acquired businesses in 2013 - 100 basis points 2012 COMPARED TO 2011Price increases in the segment contributed 1.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2012 as compared with 2011 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s water quality businesses grew at a low-single digit rate during 2012 compared to 2011. Sales growth was driven by increased demand for the businesses' laboratory and process instruments, consumables and related services primarily in the high-growth markets (other than China) and the North American industrial market. This growth was partially moderated by flat year-over-year demand in China and Western Europe. Sales in the business' chemical treatment solutions product line grew at a low-double digit rate on a year-over-year basis due primarily to the addition of new customers in the U.S. market and to a lesser extent continued international expansion. Sales in the business' ultraviolet water disinfection product line declined during the year due primarily to lower 2012 demand from municipal end markets. Sales from existing businesses in the segment's retail petroleum equipment businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2012 compared to 2011. Increased demand for the business' dispensing equipment and associated services in North America were partially offset by contraction in Western Europe as demand for retail and payment systems declined from 2011's level. Demand for most major product categories was strong in high-growth markets, especially Latin America, Russia and the Middle East. Operating profit margins increased 10 basis points during 2012 as compared to 2011. Year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons benefited 70 basis points from the favorable impact of higher sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with ongoing productivity improvement initiatives, including the restructuring actions taken in 2012 and 2011, offsetting incremental year-over-year costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments. The incremental net dilutive effect of acquisitions adversely impacted year-over-year operating margin comparisons by 60 basis points.LIFE SCIENCES & DIAGNOSTICSThe Company’s diagnostics businesses offer a broad range of analytical instruments, reagents, consumables, software and services that hospitals, physician’s offices, reference laboratories and other critical care settings use to diagnose disease and make treatment decisions. The Company’s life sciences businesses offer a broad range of research and clinical tools that scientists use to study cells and cell components to understand the causes of disease, identify new therapies and test new drugs and vaccines. 36Table of ContentsLife Sciences & Diagnostics Selected Financial Data ($ in millions) For the Year Ended December 31 2013 2012 2011Sales$6,856.4 $6,485.1 $4,627.4Operating profit1,009.8 861.1 402.3Depreciation and amortization517.3 478.2 297.2Operating profit as a % of sales14.7% 13.3% 8.7%Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales7.5% 7.4% 6.4%Components of Sales Growth 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011Existing businesses4.0 % 4.5 %Acquisitions3.0 % 37.5 %Currency exchange rates(1.5)% (2.0)%Total5.5 % 40.0 %2013 COMPARED TO 2012 Year-over-year price increases in the segment had a negligible impact on sales during 2013.Sales from existing businesses in the segment's diagnostics businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2013 as compared to 2012 due to increased demand in the clinical, acute care and pathology diagnostic businesses. The clinical diagnostics business experienced strong sales of consumables and automation hardware in high-growth markets, particularly China, that more than offset slightly negative year-over-year sales performance in North America and Europe. Sales growth in the acute care diagnostic business was due primarily to continued robust global consumables sales related to the business' growing installed base of instrumentation, which is expected to continue to grow in 2014, as well as strong demand for compact blood gas analyzers and cardiac care instruments. The year-over-year sales growth in the pathology diagnostics business was driven by strong demand for advanced staining systems and consumables in North America, China and Japan and increased demand for core histology instruments and consumables in North America and China. Sales from existing businesses in the segment's life sciences businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2013 as compared to 2012 due primarily to strong demand for new product introductions across the life sciences businesses. Fourth quarter 2013 growth rates lagged full year growth rates due to comparisons to the same period in 2012 which benefited from new product introductions. Sales of the business' broad range of mass spectrometers grew on a year-over-year basis as strong sales growth in the applied and clinical research markets and the pharmaceutical market were partially offset by sales declines in the academic research market. Geographically, year-over-year sales growth in the mass spectrometry business was strong in high-growth markets and in the second half of 2013 the business also experienced strong demand in Europe and Japan. The business' confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and sample preparation product lines also contributed to year-over-year growth, principally from demand in high-growth markets. Operating profit margins increased 140 basis points during 2013 as compared to 2012. The factors discussed below impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. 2013 vs. 2012 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:•Higher 2013 sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2012 and 2013, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments and the new U.S. medical device excise tax that took effect in 2013 - 190 basis points2013 vs. 2012 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by: •The incremental net dilutive effect of acquired businesses in 2013 - 50 basis points37Table of Contents2012 COMPARED TO 2011 Year-over-year price increases in the segment had a negligible impact on sales during 2012.The significant growth related to acquisitions for 2012 was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Beckman Coulter in June 2011. Sales associated with acquisitions are presented net of the impact of the 2012 divestiture of certain Beckman Coulter product lines, the sales from which (prior to the divestiture) were included in sales from acquired businesses. Given the insignificance of these product line sales to the segment's results of operations, prior year information was not restated to reflect these divestitures as discontinued operations.Sales from existing businesses in the segment's diagnostics business grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2012 as compared to 2011 due to increased demand in the clinical, acute care and pathology diagnostic businesses. Strong sales of consumables and automation hardware in the clinical diagnostic business in high-growth markets, especially China, more than offset weaker year-over-year sales performance in North America and Europe. In the acute care diagnostic business, sales grew due to continued strong global consumable sales related to the business' installed base of instrumentation as well as robust demand for compact blood gas analyzers. Increased demand for the business' cardiac care instruments, particularly in China, also contributed to year-over-year sales growth. Increased demand, primarily in North America and high-growth markets, for advanced staining consumables, and to a lesser extent histology systems, drove the majority of year-over-year sales growth in the pathology diagnostics business. Sales from existing businesses in the segment's life sciences businesses grew at a low-single digit rate during 2012 as compared to 2011. Sales of the business' broad range of mass spectrometers grew on a year-over-year basis as sales growth in the applied and clinical research markets was partially offset by sales declines in the pharmaceutical and academic research markets. Sales growth in the mass spectrometry business was strong in China and other high-growth markets. Sales of the business' microscopy products also grew for the year in most major geographic markets due to strong demand for the business' recently introduced confocal product offering. Operating profit margins increased 460 basis points during 2012 as compared to 2011. Acquisition related charges associated with the 2011 Beckman Coulter acquisition, including transaction costs deemed significant, change in control charges and fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue balances favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 365 basis points. Higher sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with ongoing productivity improvement initiatives, including the restructuring actions taken in 2012 and 2011, net of the impact of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments, favorably impacted year-over-year comparisons by 200 basis points. The incremental net dilutive effect of acquisitions adversely impacted segment operating profit margins by 105 basis points.Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales increased during 2012 primarily as a result of the inclusion of twelve months of Beckman Coulter's results in 2012 as compared to six months of Beckman Coulter's results in 2011.

On a year-over-year basis, sales of dental consumables were strong in North America (although North America contracted slightly in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of 2013), China and other high-growth markets and contracted slightly in Western Europe. In addition, sales from existing businesses in the segment's dental technologies businesses grew at a low-single digit rate on a year-over-year basis primarily as a result of increased demand for imaging products and treatment units. Geographically, increased sales in North America, China and certain other high-growth markets more than offset lower demand in Europe.Operating profit margins increased 10 basis points during 2013 as compared to 2012. Year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:•The incremental net accretive effect of acquired businesses in 2013 - 5 basis points•Higher 2013 sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2012 and 2013, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments and the new U.S. medical device excise tax that took effect in 2013 - 5 basis points 2012 COMPARED TO 2011 Year-over-year price increases in the segment had a negligible impact on sales during 2012. Sales from existing businesses in the segment's dental consumables businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2012 as compared to 2011, primarily as a result of increased sales of general dentistry consumables and orthodontic products. Sales of dental consumables grew in all major geographies. Sales from existing businesses in the segment's dental technologies businesses grew at a low-single digit rate on a year-over-year basis as a result of increased demand for treatment units and associated equipment, primarily in high-growth markets, as well as higher year-over-year sales of imaging products. During 2012, sales increased in all major product categories on a year-over-year basis as increased demand in North America and high-growth markets more than offset lower demand in Europe. Operating profit margins increased 280 basis points during 2012 as compared to 2011. Higher operating profit margins from additional sales volume in addition to incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with ongoing productivity improvement initiatives including the restructuring actions taken in 2012 and 2011, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments, increased operating profit margins by 270 basis points on a year-over-year basis. In addition, net higher overall operating profit margins of acquired businesses favorably impacted year-over-year comparisons by 10 basis points.INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIESThe Company’s Industrial Technologies segment is a leading global provider of equipment, consumables and software for various printing, marking, coding, design and color management applications on consumer and industrial products. The segment is also a leading global provider of electromechanical motion control solutions for the industrial automation and packaging markets. In addition to the product identification and motion strategic lines of business, the segment also includes Danaher's sensors and controls, energetic materials and engine retarder businesses. The Company sold its Accu-Sort (""ASI"") business in January 2012, its Kollmorgen Electro-Optical (""KEO"") business in February 2012 and its Pacific Scientific Aerospace (""PSA"") business in April 2011. These businesses were previously reported as part of the Industrial Technologies segment. The results of these discontinued operations are excluded from all periods presented in the financial information provided in the tables below.39Table of ContentsIndustrial Technologies Segment Selected Financial Data ($ in millions) For the Year Ended December 31 2013 2012 2011Sales$3,432.5 $3,307.9 $3,121.4Operating profit722.9 685.6 655.0Depreciation and amortization89.2 80.8 65.8Operating profit as a % of sales21.1% 20.7% 21.0%Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales2.6% 2.4% 2.1%Components of Sales Growth 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011Existing businesses(0.5)% 1.5 %Acquisitions3.5 % 6.5 %Currency exchange rates0.5 % (2.0)%Total3.5 % 6.0 %2013 COMPARED TO 2012 Price increases in the segment contributed 1.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2013 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.Sales from existing businesses in the segment's product identification businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2013 as compared to 2012. Continued increased demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables as well as packaging and color solutions in most end markets was partially offset by lower year-over-year demand in consumer electronics related equipment. Sales grew on a year-over-year basis in most major geographies, particularly in North America and Latin America. Sales from existing businesses in the segment's motion businesses declined at a high-single digit rate during 2013 as compared to 2012. Continued soft year-over-year demand in the majority of end markets served, particularly technology and defense related end markets, and the impact of exiting certain low-margin OEM product lines, was partially offset by increased sales of industrial automation products, primarily in North America. Geographically, year-over-year sales declines in Europe, China and certain end markets in North America more than offset improving demand in certain high-growth markets. The Company expects sales growth from existing businesses in the segment's motion businesses to remain negative in the first quarter of 2014 as the business continues to transition out of some low-margin businesses.Sales from existing businesses in the segment's other businesses collectively grew at a low-single digit rate during 2013 as compared to 2012. Strong year-over-year demand in the segment's energetic materials business was partially offset by lower year-over-year demand in the segment's engine retarder business. Sales from existing businesses in the segment's sensors and controls businesses were essentially flat on a year-over-year basis.Operating profit margins increased 40 basis points during 2013 as compared to 2012. The factors discussed below impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. 2013 vs. 2012 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:•Higher 2013 prices and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2012 and 2013, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments and the impact of lower 2013 unit sales - 80 basis points 2013 vs. 2012 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by: •The incremental net dilutive effect of acquired businesses in 2013 - 40 basis points 40Table of Contents2012 COMPARED TO 2011 Price increases in the segment contributed 1.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2012 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.Sales from existing businesses in the segment's product identification businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2012 as compared to 2011, due primarily to continued demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables, with strong growth experienced in both Europe and China. Increased year-over-year demand for the business' integrated packaging solutions product lines also contributed to the existing business' sales growth in the second half of 2012, with growth in most major geographies and particular strength in North America. Sales from existing businesses in the segment's motion businesses declined at a mid-single digit rate during 2012 as compared to 2011 due to continued soft demand in the majority of end markets served, particularly technology and factory automation related end markets. Both the industrial automation and engineered solutions product lines experienced year-over-year sales declines. The businesses saw improved growth in the fourth quarter of 2012 in part due to easier year-over-year comparisons.Sales from existing businesses in the segment's other businesses collectively grew at a low-single digit rate during 2012 as compared to 2011. Sales in the segment's energetic materials business increased on a year-over-year basis, partially offset by lower demand in the segment's sensors and controls and engine retarder businesses. Operating profit margins declined 30 basis points during 2012 compared to 2011. The incremental net dilutive effect of acquired businesses adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 105 basis points. Higher sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with continuing productivity improvement initiatives, including the restructuring actions taken in 2012 and 2011, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments, increased operating profit margins by 75 basis points on a year-over-year basis.COST OF SALES AND GROSS PROFIT For the Year Ended December 31($ in millions)2013 2012 2011Sales$19,118.0 $18,260.4 $16,090.5Cost of sales9,160.4 8,846.1 7,913.9Gross profit9,957.6 9,414.3 8,176.6Gross profit margin52.1% 51.6% 50.8%Gross profit margins increased 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2013 compared to 2012, due primarily to the favorable impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, the year-over-year decline in restructuring costs and continued productivity improvements. In 2013, the U.S. imposed a 2.3% excise tax on the sale or importation of certain medical devices, which affected various products in the Company's Life Sciences & Diagnostics and Dental segments. The excise tax increased the Company's 2013 cost of sales as a percentage of revenue on a year-over-year basis by approximately 20 basis points. The impact of the medical devices excise tax was partially mitigated by general price increases implemented during 2013.Gross profit margins increased 80 basis points during 2012 as compared to 2011. Year-over-year gross profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by 70 basis points as a result of acquisition related charges recorded in 2011 associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances in connection with the acquisition of Beckman Coulter in June 2011. In addition, year-over-year gross profit margin comparisons benefited from higher year-over-year sales volumes, the year-over-year decline in restructuring costs and ongoing productivity improvements. The impact of a full twelve months of Beckman Coulter results in 2012 (compared to only six months of Beckman Coulter results in 2011), partially offset these positive factors as the Beckman Coulter business had lower gross profit margins on average than the Company's existing businesses.41Table of ContentsOPERATING EXPENSES For the Year Ended December 31($ in millions)2013 2012 2011Sales$19,118.0 $18,260.4 $16,090.5Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses5,432.8 5,181.2 4,607.7Research and development (“R&D”) expenses1,249.9 1,137.9 1,018.5SG&A as a % of sales28.4% 28.4% 28.6%R&D as a % of sales6.5% 6.2% 6.3%Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales remained flat from 2012 to 2013. The benefit of increased leverage of the Company's cost base resulting from higher 2013 sales and the year-over-year decline in restructuring costs was offset by incremental year-over-year increases in investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives. Year-over-year comparisons were also adversely impacted by an impairment charge related to intangible assets associated with a communications business' technology investment which increased selling, general and administrative expenses by 15 basis points in 2013. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales declined 20 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2012 compared to 2011. Increased leverage of the Company's cost base resulting from higher sales and the year-over-year decline in restructuring costs were partially offset by incremental year-over-year investments in sales and marketing growth investments. Year-over-year comparisons were also favorably impacted by a mark to market gain on a currency swap arrangement in 2012 (refer to “Financial Instruments and Risk Management—Currency Exchange Rate Risk”). In addition, change in control payments to Beckman Coulter employees in connection with the closing of the Beckman Coulter acquisition in June 2011, as well as associated restructuring and integration charges, favorably impacted the year-over-year comparison.Research and development expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) as a percentage of sales increased 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis in 2013 as compared to 2012. Incremental year-over-year increases in investments in the Company's new product development initiatives were the primary contributors to this increase. Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales were relatively consistent for 2012 as compared to 2011. EARNINGS FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTUREDuring 2010, the Company entered into a joint venture with Cooper, combining certain of the Company’s hand tool businesses with Cooper’s Tools business to form a new entity called Apex. In February 2013, the Company and Cooper sold Apex to an unrelated third party for approximately $1.6 billion. The Company received $797 million from the sale, consisting of cash of $759 million (including $67 million of dividends received prior to closing) and a note receivable of $38 million. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $230 million (after-tax gain of $144 million or $0.20 per diluted share) in connection with this transaction. This gain is reflected as gain on sale of unconsolidated joint venture in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. As of December 31, 2013, the Company had collected the majority of this note receivable. The Company's share of the 2013 earnings generated by Apex prior to the closing of the sale was insignificant. The Company recorded $70 million and $67 million of earnings for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, reflecting its 50% ownership position. Subsequent to the sale of its investment in Apex, the Company has no continuing involvement in Apex's operations. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company sold approximately 5 million of the approximately 8 million shares of Align common stock that the Company received in 2009 as a result of a settlement between Align and Ormco Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company received cash proceeds of $251 million from the sale of these securities and recorded a pre-tax gain of $202 million ($125 million after-tax or $0.18 per diluted share). This gain is reflected as gain on sale of marketable equity securities in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.Refer to “—Earnings From Unconsolidated Joint Venture"" above for information related to the $230 million gain on the sale of Apex in 2013 and to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources – Beckman Coulter Indebtedness"" below for information related to the loss on the early extinguishment of debt in 2011. 42Table of ContentsINTEREST COSTSFor a description of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness, refer to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities and Indebtedness” below.Interest expense of $146 million for 2013 was $12 million lower than in 2012, due primarily to the repayment of the €500 million principal amount of Eurobond notes due 2013 (the ""Eurobond Notes"") and the $300 million principal amount of floating rate unsecured senior notes due 2013 (the ""2013 Notes"") upon maturity in July and June 2013, respectively. The Company's average commercial paper borrowings were also lower in 2013 as compared to 2012. Interest expense of $158 million in 2012 was $16 million higher than the 2011 interest expense of $142 million due primarily to the additional debt incurred in connection with the Beckman Coulter acquisition. The Company's average commercial paper borrowings were also higher in 2012 as compared to 2011, in large part due to borrowings used to partially fund the acquisition of Beckman Coulter.Interest income was $6 million, $3 million and $5 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.INCOME TAXESGeneralIncome tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the Company’s financial statements. The Company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.The Company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws. For a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, refer to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash and Cash Requirements” below.The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis. Based on these reviews, the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities, tax rulings and court decisions, and the expiration of statutes of limitations, reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary. For a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.Year-Over-Year Changes in the Tax Provision and Effective Tax RateThe Company’s effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was 24.4%, 23.6% and 20.9%, respectively.The Company’s effective tax rate for each of 2013, 2012 and 2011 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due principally to the Company’s earnings outside the United States that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate. In addition, the effective tax rates of 24.4% in 2013, 23.6% in 2012 and 20.9% in 2011 are lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate due to recognition of tax benefits associated with favorable resolutions of certain international and domestic uncertain tax positions and the lapse of certain statutes of limitations. The effective tax rate for 2013 is also lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate due to the retroactive reinstatement of certain tax benefits and credits resulting from the enactment of the American Tax Relief Act of 2012. These favorable items were offset by adjustments of reserve estimates related to prior period uncertain tax positions and on-going audit settlement estimates in various jurisdictions. The matters referenced above have been treated as discrete items in the periods they occurred and in the aggregate reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately 20 basis points in 2013, 30 basis points in 2012 and 240 basis points in 2011.The Company conducts business globally, and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the United States federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities. During 2013, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) completed examinations of certain of the Company's federal income tax returns for the years 2008 and 2009 and has commenced its examinations of the Company's federal income tax returns for 2010 and 2011. In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, the United Kingdom and various other countries, states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2000 through 2012.43Table of ContentsTax authorities in Denmark and Germany have raised significant issues related to the deductibility and taxability of interest accrued by certain of the Company's subsidiaries. On December 10, 2013, the Company received assessments from the Danish tax authority (“SKAT”) totaling approximately DKK 1.1 billion (approximately $200 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2013) imposing withholding tax and interest thereon relating to interest accrued in Denmark on borrowings from certain of the Company's subsidiaries for the years 2004-2009. If the SKAT claims are successful, it is likely that the Company would be assessed additional amounts for years through 2013 totaling approximately DKK 800 million (approximately $144 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2013) as well as future interest on the disputed withholding tax for subsequent periods prior to such a determination. Discussions with the German tax authorities are ongoing and final assessments have not been issued. Management believes the positions the Company has taken in both Denmark and Germany are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and intends to vigorously defend its positions, including contesting the SKAT assessment; however, the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain, could take many years, and individually or in the aggregate could result in a material adverse impact to the Company's financial statements, including its effective tax rate.The Company's effective tax rate for 2014 is expected to be approximately 24%. This anticipated rate reflects no benefit from the research and experimentation credit in the United States which expired at the end of 2013.INFLATIONThe effect of inflation on the Company’s revenues and net earnings was not significant in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 or 2011.FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENTThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit risk, equity prices and commodity prices, each of which could impact its financial statements. The Company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. In addition, the Company’s broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole.Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. A change in interest rates on long-term debt impacts the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt but not the Company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2013, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt (excluding the LYONs, which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from the value of its underlying common stock) by approximately $110 million. However, since the Company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturity, the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt does not affect the Company’s results of operations or stockholders’ equity.As of December 31, 2013, the Company’s variable-rate debt obligations consisted primarily of U.S. dollar commercial paper borrowings (refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2013). As a result, the Company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. As these shorter duration obligations mature, the Company anticipates issuing additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. In 2013, a 50% increase in average market interest rates on the Company’s commercial paper borrowings would have increased the Company’s interest expense by approximately $0.4 million. A 50% hypothetical fluctuation is used as the Company’s actual commercial paper interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2013. Currency Exchange Rate RiskThe Company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than Danaher’s functional currency or the functional currency of our applicable subsidiary. The Company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars, Danaher’s functional currency. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. In particular, 44Table of Contentsthe Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the Company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2013 would have resulted in a reduction of stockholders’ equity of approximately $750 million.Currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2013 reported sales by 0.5% on a year-over-year basis as the U.S. dollar was, on average, stronger against other major currencies during 2013 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2012. The U.S. dollar's strength against other major currencies throughout the majority of 2013 more than offset the positive impact on sales from the slight weakening of the U.S. dollar prior to the end of the fourth quarter 2013.If the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2013 were to prevail throughout 2014, currency exchange rates would positively impact 2014 estimated sales by approximately 0.5% relative to the Company’s performance in 2013. Additional weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would further positively impact the Company’s sales and results of operations. Any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would adversely impact the Company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis.The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales, profit, and assets and liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In connection with a prior acquisition, the Company acquired a currency swap agreement that required the Company to purchase approximately 184 million Japanese Yen (JPY/¥) at a rate of $1/¥102.25 on a monthly basis through June 1, 2018. During 2013, the Company terminated portions of the currency swap agreement, reducing the Company's monthly purchase commitment to approximately ¥27 million. In connection with the partial termination of the currency swap agreement, the Company paid $10 million to the swap counterparties representing the fair value of the terminated portions of the currency swap. As of December 31, 2013, the aggregate Japanese Yen purchase commitment was approximately ¥1.4 billion (approximately $14 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2013). The currency swap does not qualify for hedge accounting and as a result changes in the fair value of the currency swap are reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings each reporting period. During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded pre-tax income of $14 million and $22 million and a pre-tax charge of $8 million, respectively, related to changes in the fair value of this currency swap.Credit RiskThe Company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, receivables from customers and derivatives. The Company places cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the Company’s customers. The Company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate.The Company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and, with the exception of the Yen swap noted above, such transactions are generally insignificant to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. These transactions are entered into only with high-quality financial institutions and exposure at any one institution is limited.Equity Price RiskThe Company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio includes publicly traded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale investments due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the equity securities. A 10% decline in the value of these equity securities as of December 31, 2013 would have reduced the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio by $39 million.45Table of ContentsCommodity Price RiskFor a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices, refer “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESManagement assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses, consummating strategic acquisitions, paying interest and servicing debt and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. Following is an overview of the Company's cash flows and liquidity for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011: Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity For the Years Ended December 31($ in millions)2013 2012 2011Total operating cash flows provided by continuing operations$3,585.3 $3,502.1 $2,732.1 Cash paid for acquisitions$(957.2) $(1,796.8) $(6,210.8)Payments for additions to property, plant and equipment(551.5) (458.3) (334.5)Proceeds from sale of unconsolidated joint venture707.4 — —Proceeds from sale of marketable equity securities251.2 — —Proceeds from sale of discontinued operations— 337.5 680.1All other investing activities(2.4) 30.0 17.9Net cash used in investing activities$(552.5) $(1,887.6) $(5,847.3) Proceeds from the issuance of common stock$177.4 $212.0 $1,112.5Payment of dividends(52.1) (86.4) (61.3)Purchase of stock— (648.4) —Net (repayments of) proceeds from borrowings (maturities of 90 days or less)(763.3) 195.9 854.0Proceeds from borrowings (maturities longer than 90 days)— — 1,785.8Repayments of borrowings (maturities longer than 90 days)(967.8) (61.5) (1,602.4)Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities$(1,605.8) $(388.4) $2,088.6•Operating cash flows from continuing operations increased $83 million, or approximately 2%, during 2013 as compared to 2012.•The repayment of borrowings with maturities longer than 90 days constituted the most significant use of cash during 2013. The Company repaid $968 million of such borrowings during 2013, primarily related to the repayment of the Eurobond Notes and the 2013 Notes upon their maturity in July and June 2013, respectively. The Company also reduced outstanding borrowings with maturities of 90 days or less, primarily commercial paper borrowings, by $763 million during 2013.•The Company acquired fourteen businesses during 2013 for total consideration (net of cash acquired) of $957 million.•In February 2013, the Company sold its investment in Apex, an unconsolidated joint venture. Aggregate cash proceeds received during 2013 in connection with the sale were $774 million (including $67 million of dividends received during 2013 prior to the closing of the sale).•During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company sold approximately 5 million of the approximately 8 million shares of Align common stock that the Company received in 2009 as a result of a settlement between Align and Ormco Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company received cash proceeds of $251 million from the sale of these securities.46Table of Contents•As of December 31, 2013, the Company held approximately $3.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents.Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for items such as income taxes, restructuring activities, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows.Operating cash flows from continuing operations were $3.6 billion for 2013, an increase of $83 million, or 2% as compared to 2012. The year-over-year change in operating cash flows from 2012 to 2013 was primarily attributable to the following factors:•Earnings from continuing operations increased by $396 million in 2013 as compared to 2012. During 2013, the Company realized a $230 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the Apex joint venture and a $202 million pre-tax gain on the sale of Align common stock. While both of these gains are included in earnings from continuing operations, the proceeds from these sales are shown in the investing activities section of the Statement of Cash Flows and therefore do not contribute to operating cash flows.•Earnings for 2013 reflected an increase of $55 million of depreciation and amortization expense as compared to 2012. Amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions. Depreciation expense relates to both the Company's manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operating-type lease arrangements. Depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows.•The aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable provided $197 million in operating cash flows during 2013, a $150 million increase compared to 2012 during which these items provided $47 million in operating cash flows. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively the Company manages the cash conversion cycle, which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day it pays for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from its customers.•Accrued expenses and other liabilities used $89 million in operating cash flows during 2013, a $236 million decline compared to 2012 during which these items provided $147 million in operating cash flows. This change was driven primarily by cash income tax payments from continuing operations, which increased by $174 million during 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to taxes on the sale of the Apex joint venture and Align common stock noted above. Net cash payments for income taxes from continuing operations totaled $529 million and $355 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The timing of customer deposits received in 2012 in the Test & Measurement segment's network communications business also contributed to the year-over-year decline.Operating cash flows from continuing operations were $3.5 billion for 2012, an increase of $770 million, or 28% as compared to 2011. The increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to the increase in earnings in 2012 as compared to 2011. Investing ActivitiesCash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures and cash proceeds from divestitures of businesses or assets.Net cash used in investing activities was $553 million during 2013 compared to $1.9 billion of net cash used in 2012 and $5.8 billion of net cash used in 2011.Acquisitions and Divestitures2013 Acquisitions and DivestituresFor a discussion of the Company’s 2013 acquisitions, the sale of the Company's ownership interest in Apex and the sale of Align common stock, refer to “—Overview.”47Table of Contents2012 Acquisitions and DivestituresDuring 2012, the Company acquired fourteen businesses for total consideration of $1.8 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company's five segments. The aggregate annual sales of these fourteen businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $666 million. In January 2012, the Company completed the sale of its integrated scanning system business (the ASI business) for $132 million in cash. In addition, in February 2012, the Company completed the sale of its KEO business for $205 million in cash. These businesses were part of the Industrial Technologies segment. The businesses had combined annual revenues of $275 million in 2011. The Company recorded an aggregate after-tax gain on the sale of these businesses of $94 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in its first quarter 2012 results. The Company has reported the ASI and KEO businesses (as well as the PSA business, referenced below) as discontinued operations in its consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the results of operations for all periods presented reflect these businesses as discontinued operations. 2011 Acquisitions and DivestituresOn June 30, 2011, following the successful completion of the Company’s tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Beckman Coulter, the Company completed the acquisition of Beckman Coulter by merging one of its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries with and into Beckman Coulter such that Beckman Coulter became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Beckman Coulter had revenues of $3.7 billion in 2010, and is included in the Company’s Life Sciences & Diagnostics segment from the acquisition date. The Company obtained control of Beckman Coulter on June 24, 2011 and, as a result, the earnings of Beckman Coulter are reflected in the Company’s results from June 25, 2011 forward.The Company paid $5.5 billion in cash (net of $450 million of cash acquired) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Beckman Coulter and assumed $1.6 billion of indebtedness in connection with the acquisition. The Company financed the acquisition of Beckman Coulter using (1) $2.3 billion of available cash, (2) net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, of $966 million from the underwritten public offering of the Company’s common stock on June 21, 2011, (3) net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, of $1.8 billion from the underwritten public offering of senior unsecured notes on June 23, 2011, and (4) net proceeds from the sale of additional commercial paper under the Company’s U.S. commercial paper program prior to the closing of the acquisition.In addition to the acquisition of Beckman Coulter, during 2011, the Company completed the acquisition of thirteen other businesses (including the acquisition of EskoArtwork, a leading full-service solutions provider for the digital packaging design and production market) for total consideration of $669 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The additional businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company's five segments. The aggregate annual sales of these thirteen businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the acquired company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $325 million. In April 2011, the Company completed the divestiture of its PSA business for $680 million in cash. This business, which was part of the Industrial Technologies segment, had annual revenues of $377 million in 2010. The Company recorded an after-tax gain on the sale of PSA of $202 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in its second quarter 2011 results. Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development, improving information technology systems and the manufacture of instruments that are used in operating-type lease arrangements that certain of the Company’s businesses enter into with customers. Capital expenditures totaled $552 million in 2013, $458 million in 2012 and $334 million in 2011. The increase in capital spending in 2013 and 2012 reflects continued investments in equipment leased to customers and other operating assets. In 2014, the Company expects capital spending to approximate $650 million, though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions. Financing Activities and IndebtednessCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper, common stock and debt, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, payments of principal on indebtedness, payments for repurchases of common stock and payments of dividends to shareholders. Financing activities used cash of $1.6 billion during 2013 compared to $388 million of cash used during 2012. The year-over-year increase was due primarily to the repayment of the Eurobond Notes and the 2013 Notes upon their maturity in July and June 2013, respectively, and the incrementally higher year-over-year net repayment of commercial paper borrowings. 48Table of ContentsTotal debt was $3.5 billion and $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company’s debt as of December 31, 2013 was as follows:•$450 million of outstanding U.S. dollar commercial paper;•$400 million aggregate principal amount of 1.3% senior unsecured notes due 2014 (the “2014 Notes”);•$500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.3% senior unsecured notes due 2016 (the “2016 Notes”);•$500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2018 (the “2018 Notes”);•$750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.4% senior unsecured notes due 2019 (the “2019 Notes”);•$600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.9% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes” and together with the 2014 Notes and 2016 Notes, the “2011 Financing Notes”);•$154 million of zero coupon Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2021 (“LYONs”); and•$145 million of other borrowings.The 2011 Financing Notes, the 2018 Notes and the 2019 Notes are collectively referred to as the “Notes”.Commercial Paper Programs and Credit FacilityThe Company satisfies any short-term liquidity needs that are not met through operating cash flow and available cash primarily through issuances of commercial paper under its U.S. and Euro commercial paper programs. Under these programs, the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes. Interest expense on the notes is paid at maturity and is generally based on the ratings assigned to the Company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to LIBOR. Borrowings under the program are available for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. During 2013, as commercial paper balances matured the Company either paid such balances from available cash or refinanced such balances by issuing new commercial paper. There was no commercial paper outstanding under the Euro program as of December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, borrowings outstanding under the Company’s U.S. commercial paper program had a weighted average annual interest rate of 0.1% and a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately fourteen days. Commercial paper outstanding at any one time during the year had balances ranging from $450 million to $1.2 billion, carried interest at annual rates ranging between 0.1% and 0.2% and had original maturities between one and sixty days. The Company has classified its borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program as of December 31, 2013 and its 2014 Notes as long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company had the intent and ability, as supported by availability under the Credit Facility referenced below, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date.Credit support for the commercial paper program is provided by a $2.5 billion unsecured multi-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that expires on July 15, 2016 (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Under the Credit Facility, borrowings (other than bid loans) bear interest at a rate equal to (at the Company’s option) either (1) a LIBOR-based rate plus a margin that varies according to the Company’s long-term debt credit rating (the “Eurodollar Rate”), or (2) the highest of (a) the Federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (b) the prime rate and (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1%, plus in each case a margin that varies according to the Company’s long-term debt credit rating. In addition to certain initial fees the Company paid at inception of the Credit Facility, the Company is obligated to pay an annual commitment fee that varies according to its long-term debt credit rating. The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the facility) of 0.65 to 1.00 or less, and also contains customary representations, warranties, conditions precedent, events of default, indemnities and affirmative and negative covenants. As of December 31, 2013, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Facility and the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the facility. The non-performance by any member of the Credit Facility syndicate would reduce the maximum capacity of the Credit Facility by such member's commitment amount. In addition to the Credit Facility, the Company has entered into reimbursement agreements with various commercial banks to support the issuance of letters of credit.The availability of the Credit Facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of the Company’s commercial paper program. The Company expects to limit any borrowings under the Credit Facility to amounts that would leave sufficient credit available under the facility to allow the Company to borrow, if needed, to repay all of the outstanding commercial paper as it matures.49Table of ContentsThe Company’s ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related costs of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of the Company’s credit rating and market conditions. Any downgrade in the Company’s credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the Company’s commercial paper program and the Credit Facility, and could limit or preclude the Company’s ability to issue commercial paper. If the Company’s access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a downgrade, change in market conditions or otherwise, the Company would expect to rely on a combination of available cash, operating cash flow and the Company’s Credit Facility to provide short-term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under the Company’s Credit Facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings.On June 17, 2011, the Company entered into a $3.0 billion 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility (the “364-Day Facility”) in connection with the acquisition of Beckman Coulter. The Company terminated the facility as of December 29, 2011. There were no outstanding borrowings under the 364-Day Facility at any time during the term of the facility.Other Long-Term Indebtedness2011 Financing Notes—On June 23, 2011, the Company completed the underwritten public offering of the 2011 Financing Notes and the 2013 Notes, all of which are unsecured. The 2013 Notes were issued at 100% of their principal amount, accrued interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.25% per year and matured and were repaid in June 2013. The 2014 Notes were issued at 99.918% of their principal amount, will mature on June 23, 2014 and accrue interest at the rate of 1.3% per year. The 2016 Notes were issued at 99.84% of their principal amount, will mature on June 23, 2016 and accrue interest at the rate of 2.3% per year. The 2021 Notes were issued at 99.975% of their principal amount, will mature on June 23, 2021 and accrue interest at the rate of 3.9% per year. The net proceeds from the 2011 Financing Notes and 2013 Notes offering, after deducting expenses and the underwriters’ discount, were approximately $1.8 billion and were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Beckman Coulter. The Company paid interest on the 2013 Notes quarterly in arrears on March 21, June 21, September 21 and December 21 of each year. The Company pays interest on the 2014 Notes, 2016 Notes and 2021 Notes semi-annually in arrears, on June 23 and December 23 of each year.2019 Notes—In March 2009, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of the 2019 Notes, which were issued at 99.93% of their principal amount, will mature on March 1, 2019 and accrue interest at the rate of 5.4% per year. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, were approximately $745 million. A portion of the net proceeds were used to repay a portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial paper and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The Company pays interest on the 2019 Notes semi-annually in arrears, on March 1 and September 1 of each year.2018 Notes—In December 2007, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of the 2018 Notes, which were issued at 99.39% of their principal amount, will mature on January 15, 2018 and accrue interest at the rate of 5.625% per year. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, were approximately $493 million, which were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance the acquisition of the Tektronix business. The Company pays interest on the 2018 Notes semi-annually in arrears, on January 15 and July 15 of each year.LYONs—In 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in LYONs. The net proceeds to the Company were $505 million, of which approximately $100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The LYONs carry a yield to maturity of 2.375% (with contingent interest payable as described below). Holders of the LYONs may convert each $1,000 of principal amount at maturity into 29.0704 shares of the Company’s common stock (in the aggregate for all LYONs that were originally issued, approximately 24 million shares of the Company’s common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January 22, 2021. As of December 31, 2013, an aggregate of approximately 18 million shares of the Company’s common stock had been issued upon conversion of LYONs. As of December 31, 2013, the accreted value of the outstanding LYONs was lower than the traded market value of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time at scheduled redemption prices. Holders had the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash and/or Company common stock, at the Company’s option, on each of January 22, 2004 and January 22, 2011, which resulted in aggregate notes with an accreted value of approximately $1 million being redeemed by the Company for cash.Under the terms of the LYONs, the Company will pay contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six month period from January 23 to July 22 and from July 23 to January 22 if the average market price of a LYON for a specified measurement period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. The amount of contingent interest to be paid with respect to any quarterly period is equal to the higher of either 0.0315% of the bonds’ average market price during the specified measurement period or the amount of the common stock dividend paid during such quarterly period multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon conversion of a LYON. The Company paid $1 million of contingent interest on the LYONs for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Except for the contingent interest described above, the Company will not pay interest on the LYONs prior to maturity.50Table of ContentsEurobond Notes—On July 21, 2006, a financing subsidiary of the Company issued the Eurobond Notes in a private placement outside the United States. Payment obligations under these Eurobond Notes were guaranteed by the Company. The net proceeds of the offering, after the deduction of underwriting commissions but prior to the deduction of other issuance costs, were €496 million ($627 million based on exchange rates in effect at the time the offering closed) and were used to pay down a portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The Eurobond Notes matured and were repaid in July 2013.Covenants and Redemption Provisions Applicable to the NotesThe Company may redeem some or all of the 2014 Notes, the 2016 Notes, the 2018 Notes and/or the 2019 Notes at any time by paying the principal amount and a “make-whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Prior to March 23, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), the Company may redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes by paying the principal amount and a “make-whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On or after March 23, 2021, the Company may redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes for their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. If a change of control triggering event occurs with respect to the Notes, each holder of Notes may require the Company to repurchase some or all of its Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued interest. A change of control triggering event means the occurrence of both a change of control and a rating event, each as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture. Except in connection with a change of control triggering event as described above, the Company does not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt. The indentures pursuant to which the Notes were issued each contain customary covenants including, for example, limits on the incurrence of secured debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to the Company’s operations and as of December 31, 2013, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.Beckman Coulter IndebtednessIn connection with the acquisition of Beckman Coulter in June 2011, the Company assumed indebtedness with a fair value of $1.6 billion (the “Beckman Coulter Notes”). During the third quarter of 2011, the Company retired substantially all of the Beckman Coulter Notes using proceeds from the issuance of U.S. dollar commercial paper and recorded a $33 million ($21 million, after tax or $0.03 per diluted share) charge to earnings due to “make whole” payments associated with the extinguishment of certain of the Beckman Coulter Notes. The charge to earnings is reflected as part of other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.For additional details regarding the Company’s debt as of December 31, 2013 see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Shelf Registration StatementThe Company has filed a “well-known seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance. The Company expects to use net proceeds realized by the Company from future securities sales off this shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, including without limitation repayment or refinancing of debt or other corporate obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends, and working capital. On June 21, 2011, the Company used its then-current shelf registration statement to complete the underwritten public offering of 19,250,000 shares of Danaher common stock at a price to the public of $51.75 per share. The net proceeds, after deducting expenses and the underwriters' discount, were approximately $966 million and were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for Beckman Coulter. On June 23, 2011, the Company also used this shelf registration statement to complete the underwritten public offering of the 2011 Financing Notes and the 2013 Notes. Stock Repurchase ProgramNeither the Company nor any “affiliated purchaser” repurchased any shares of Company common stock during 2013. On July 16, 2013, the Company's Board of Directors approved a repurchase program (the “2013 Repurchase Program”) authorizing the repurchase of up to 20 million shares of the Company's common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The 2013 Repurchase Program replaced the repurchase program approved by the Company's Board of Directors in May 2010 (the “2010 Repurchase Program”). There is no expiration date for the 2013 Repurchase Program, and the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will be determined by the Company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The 2013 Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Company's equity compensation plans (or 51Table of Contentsany successor plan) and for other corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2013, 20 million shares remained available for repurchase pursuant to the 2013 Repurchase Program. The Company expects to fund any future stock repurchases using the Company's available cash balances or proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper.During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company repurchased approximately 12.5 million shares of Company common stock under the 2010 Repurchase Program in open market transactions at a cost of $648 million. Neither the Company nor any “affiliated purchaser” repurchased any shares of Company common stock during 2011. DividendsThe Company declared a regular dividend of $0.025 per share that was paid on January 31, 2014 to holders of record on December 30, 2013. Aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2013 were $52 million. Dividend payments were lower in 2013 as compared to 2012 because the Company made no cash payments for dividends during the first quarter of 2013 because the Company's Board had determined to accelerate the quarterly dividend payment that normally would have been paid in January 2013 and paid it in December 2012.Cash and Cash RequirementsAs of December 31, 2013, the Company held $3.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an approximate weighted average annual interest rate of 0.3%. $932 million of this amount was held within the United States and $2.2 billion was held outside of the United States. The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures and acquisitions, to pay interest and service debt, pay taxes and any related interest or penalties, fund its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock, pay dividends to shareholders and support other business needs. The Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, particularly in connection with acquisitions, the Company may also borrow under its commercial paper program or the Credit Facility, enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program and/or access the capital markets. The Company also may from time to time access the capital markets to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions. With respect to the 2014 Notes that mature in 2014, the Company expects to repay the principal amounts when due under these notes using available cash, proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and/or proceeds from other debt issuances.While repatriation of some cash held outside the United States may be restricted by local laws, most of the Company's foreign cash balances could be repatriated to the United States but, under current law, could be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. For most of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company makes an election regarding the amount of earnings intended for indefinite reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. A deferred tax liability has been accrued for the funds that are available to be repatriated to the United States. No provisions for U.S. income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, and the amount of U.S. income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the Company could employ if it repatriated these earnings. The cash that the Company's foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments, including acquisitions. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately $10.6 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, management believes that is has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs, including its cash needs in the United States.During 2013, the Company contributed $4 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan and $53 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2014, the Company’s cash contribution requirements for its U.S. and its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately $50 million and $50 million, respectively. The ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan’s funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates and other factors.52Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations relating to continuing operations as of December 31, 2013 under (1) long-term debt obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company’s balance sheet under GAAP. The amounts presented in the table below do not reflect $599 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, the timing of which is uncertain.

Interest on long-term debt and capital lease obligations is reflected in a separate line in the table.(c) Interest payments on long-term debt are projected for future periods using the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2013. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates.(d) As described in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain leases require the Company to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises. These future costs are not included in the schedule above.(e) Consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction.(f) Primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies and allowances, performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs, self-insurance and litigation claims, post-retirement benefits, pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities (excluding unrecognized tax benefits) and deferred compensation obligations. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management’s estimates over the terms of these arrangements and is largely based upon historical experience.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of off-balance sheet commitments of the Company as of December 31, 2013. Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period($ in millions)Total Less ThanOne Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than5 YearsGuarantees$379.2 $299.2 $38.0 $16.7 $25.3Guarantees consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit, bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds. These guarantees have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors, customers, financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure the Company’s obligations and/or performance requirements related to specific transactions.53Table of ContentsOther Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters or tax matters. The Company has not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they relate to unknown conditions and the Company cannot estimate the potential liabilities from such matters, but the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. In addition, as a result of these divestitures, as well as restructuring activities, certain properties leased by the Company have been sublet to third parties. In the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by such sub-lessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the Company’s financial statements.In the normal course of business, the Company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers, suppliers or other business partners for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the Company’s products or services or claims alleging that Company products, services or software infringe third party intellectual property. The Company has not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual obligations table above. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations.The Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the Company, or by reason of serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to limited exceptions. Danaher’s Amended and Restated By-laws provide for similar indemnification rights. In addition, Danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of Danaher Corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which Danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding. While the Company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage.Legal ProceedingsPlease refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding certain litigation matters.In addition to the litigation matters noted under “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters – Environmental, Health & Safety,” the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). These matters primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Company’s products, software and services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiture related matters, as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, divested businesses. Some of these lawsuits may include claims for punitive, consequential and/or compensatory damages, as well as injunctive relief. Based upon the Company’s experience, current information and applicable law, it does not believe it is reasonably possible that these proceedings and claims will have a material effect on its financial statements.While the Company maintains general, products, property, workers’ compensation, automobile, cargo, aviation, crime, fiduciary and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (and has acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions) up to certain limits that cover certain of these claims, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses. For general, products and property liability and most other insured risks, the Company purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to amounts within the self-insured retention. In addition, while the Company believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims, these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses.In accordance with accounting guidance, the Company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss does not meet the known or probable level but is reasonably possible and a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. The Company's reserves consist of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts for anticipated developments of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims. The specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified with the assistance of legal counsel and outside risk professionals where appropriate. In addition, outside risk professionals assist in the 54Table of Contentsdetermination of reserves for incurred but not yet reported claims through evaluation of the Company’s specific loss history, actual claims reported and industry trends among statistical and other factors. Reserve estimates may be adjusted as additional information regarding a claim becomes known. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including litigation developments, the discovery of new facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. While the Company actively pursues financial recoveries from insurance providers, it does not recognize any recoveries until realized or until such time as a sustained pattern of collections is established related to historical matters of a similar nature and magnitude. If the Company’s self-insurance and litigation reserves prove inadequate, it would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s financial statements. Please see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the amount of our accruals for self-insurance and litigation liability.For a discussion of additional risks related to legal proceedings, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESManagement’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience, the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments.The Company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to Note 1 in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.Accounts Receivable: The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect probable credit losses inherent in its portfolio of receivables. Determination of the allowances requires management to exercise judgment about the timing, frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the allowances for doubtful accounts and, therefore, net income. The allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s best estimate of the credit losses expected from the Company’s trade accounts, contract and finance receivable portfolios. The level of the allowances is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors including historical loss experience by receivable type, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic conditions and credit risk quality. The Company regularly performs detailed reviews of its accounts receivable portfolio to determine if an impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowances. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate with a severity, frequency and/or timing different from the Company's assumptions, additional allowances would be required and the Company’s financial statements would be adversely impacted.Inventories: The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market value. The Company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions of future demand and related pricing. Estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand, technological advances and pricing competition in many of the Company’s markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the Company’s control. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, the Company could be required to reduce the value of its inventory, which would adversely impact the Company’s financial statements.Acquired Intangibles: The Company’s business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill, in-process research and development and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the Company may incur. Refer to Notes 1, 2 and 7 in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for a description of the Company’s policies relating to goodwill, acquired intangibles and acquisitions.In performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market based approach. The Company estimates fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the Company’s reporting units, in addition to recent market available sale transactions of comparable businesses. In evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach, management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data as well as 55Table of Contentsjudgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected. In certain circumstances the Company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (i.e., an income approach) in order to validate the results of the market approach. The discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2013, the Company had twenty-two reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment. Management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units decreases as these businesses are integrated into the Company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth. The carrying value of the goodwill included in each individual reporting unit ranges from $7 million to $4.4 billion. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2013 indicated that in all instances, the fair values of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 3% to approximately 885%. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this hypothetical 10% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units ranged from approximately -7% to approximately 785%. Two reporting units’ hypothetically 10% decreased fair values were lower than their respective carrying values. Management evaluated other factors relating to the fair value of these reporting units, including as applicable the short period of time since the acquisition of these businesses, results of the estimate of fair value using the income approach, market positions of the businesses, comparability of market sales transactions and financial and operating performance, and concluded no impairment charge was required. The Company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company also tests intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. These analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues, expenses, market conditions and discount rates related to these assets.If actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the Company’s financial statements.Contingent Liabilities: As discussed above under “—Liquidity and Capital Resources – Legal Proceedings”, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors, including those discussed above under “—Liquidity and Capital Resources – Legal Proceedings”. If the reserves established by the Company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s financial statements.Revenue Recognition: The Company derives revenues from the sale of products and services. Refer to Note 1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s revenue recognition policies. Although most of the Company’s sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, certain agreements contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. As a result, judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if so, how the consideration should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. The Company allocates revenue to each element in the contractual arrangement based on a selling price hierarchy that, in some instances, may require the Company to estimate the selling price of certain deliverables that are not sold separately or where third party evidence of pricing is not observable. The Company’s estimate of selling price impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements. The Company also enters into lease arrangements with customers, which requires the Company to determine whether the arrangements are operating or sales-type leases. Certain of the Company’s lease contracts are customized for larger customers and often result in complex terms and conditions that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criteria.56Table of ContentsIf the Company's judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect, the Company's revenues in particular periods may be adversely affected. Stock-Based Compensation: For a description of the Company’s stock-based compensation accounting practices, refer to Note 18 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards require subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the awards, stock price volatility and expected forfeiture rate. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent the Company’s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. If actual results are not consistent with management’s assumptions and estimates, the Company’s equity-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits: For a description of the Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefit accounting practices, refer to Notes 11 and 12 in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Calculations of the amount of pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations, including assumptions regarding discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rates of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. If the assumptions used in calculating pension and other post-retirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change (as a result of differences in actual experience, changes in key economic indicators or other factors) the Company’s financial statements could be materially affected. A 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the U.S. net obligation by $130 million ($81 million on an after tax basis) and the non-U.S. net obligation by $109 million ($77 million on an after tax basis) from the amounts recorded in the financial statements as of December 31, 2013.For 2013, the estimated long-term rate of return for the U.S. plan is 7.5%, and the Company intends to use an assumption of 7.5% for 2014. This expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected long-term returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets. The U.S. plan targets to invest between 60% and 70% of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments. The balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in bond funds. The Company’s non-U.S. plan assets consist of various insurance contracts, equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan. The estimated long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 1.25% to 6.70%. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2013 was reduced by 50 basis points, pension expense for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans for 2013 would have increased $9 million ($6 million on an after-tax basis) and $4 million ($3 million on an after-tax basis), respectively. For a discussion of the Company’s 2013 and anticipated 2014 defined benefit pension plan contributions, please see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash and Cash Requirements”.Income Taxes: For a description of the Company's income tax accounting policies, refer to Notes 1 and 13 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized which requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding: (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. Future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial statements. The Company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when, based upon the technical merits, it is “more-likely-than-not” that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. Judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions. The Company re-evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances, including when: (i) a tax audit is completed; (ii) applicable tax laws change, including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (iii) the applicable statute of limitations expires.In addition, certain of the Company's tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in Denmark and Germany (see “—Results of Operations – Income Taxes"" and Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws. However, the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in the Company being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact to the Company's financial statements, including its effective tax rate.An increase in our nominal tax rate of 1.0% would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 of $36 million.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSNone. 57Table of ContentsITEM 7A.

Our Internet site and the information contained on or connected to that site are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.Conditions in the global economy, the markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our business is sensitive to general economic conditions. Slower global economic growth, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt, volatility in the currency and credit markets, high levels of unemployment, reduced levels of capital expenditures, changes in government fiscal and monetary policies, government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics, sequestration, other austerity measures and other challenges that affect the global economy adversely affect the Company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, including having the effect of:•reducing demand for our products (in this Item 1A, references to products also includes software) and services, limiting the financing available to our customers and suppliers, increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies;•increasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories;•increasing price competition in our served markets; •supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; •increasing the risk of impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, and the risk that we may not be able to fully recover the value of other assets such as real estate and tax assets; and•increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which, in addition to increasing the risks identified above, could result in preference actions against us.Although we have been able to continue accessing the commercial paper and other capital markets through the date of this report, there can be no assurances that such markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations.If growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period, if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy don't benefit the markets we serve, our business and financial statements could be adversely affected.Our restructuring actions could have long-term adverse effects on our business. In recent years, we have implemented multiple, significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. These restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities (including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses) reduce our available talent, assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases. In addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements, unexpected costs or failure to meet 16Table of Contentstargeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we realize from such actions. Any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements.Our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve, and visibility into our markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers' capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies, and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities. Demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in incentive programs, new product introductions and customer inventory levels. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period.We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share. Even if we compete effectively, we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services. Our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. Because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors; please see “Item 1. Business - Competition” for additional details. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets, including high-growth markets. Our failure to compete effectively and/or pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements, and our expansion into new markets may result in greater-than-expected risks, liabilities and expenses.Our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation.We generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis, our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer. Our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to:•correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;•allocate our research and development funding to products and services with higher growth prospects;•anticipate and respond to our competitors' development of new products and services and technological innovations;•differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings and avoid commoditization;•innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets;•obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies before our competitors do;•successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time;•obtain necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope, including with respect to medical device products by demonstrating satisfactory clinical results where applicable; and•stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies.In addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. In addition, promising new offerings may fail to reach 17Table of Contentsthe market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement.Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, though we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements.Any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price.Our ability to grow revenues, earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies. We may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price. Promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including high valuations, competition among prospective buyers, the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms. In addition, competition for acquisitions may result in higher purchase prices. Changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions.Our acquisition of businesses, joint ventures and strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements.As part of our business strategy we acquire businesses and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course, some of which may be material; please see “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) for additional details. These acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our financial statements:•any acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it, or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable.•we may incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic relationships.•acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic relationships could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in any given period, or over the long-term.•pre-closing and post-closing earnings charges could adversely impact operating results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period to period.•acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic relationships could create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address.•we could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other controls and systems and retaining key employees and customers.•we may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition, joint venture or strategic relationship.•we may assume by acquisition, joint venture or strategic relationship unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company's activities. The realization of any of these liabilities or 18Table of Contentsdeficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations.•in connection with acquisitions and joint ventures, we often enter into post-closing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments, earn-out obligations and indemnification obligations, which may have unpredictable financial results.•as a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet. If we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets.•we may have interests that diverge from those of our joint venture partners or other strategic partners and we may not be able to direct the management and operations of the joint venture or other strategic relationship in the manner we believe is most appropriate, exposing us to additional risk. The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements.Divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements.We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest, spin-off, split-off or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. These transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business. For example, when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not become satisfied. In addition, divestitures or other dispositions may dilute the Company's earnings per share, have other adverse financial and accounting impacts and distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. In addition, we have retained responsibility for and/or have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold or disposed. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.We are pursuing a plan to distribute ownership of our communications business to Danaher shareholders and merge the business into a subsidiary of NetScout in a tax-free transaction. The proposed transaction may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits.Danaher has announced plans to distribute ownership of its communications business to Danaher shareholders in either a spin-off transaction, a split-off transaction, or a combination split-off and spin-off and merge the business into a subsidiary of NetScout. Both the distribution and merger are expected to qualify as tax-free transactions to Danaher and its shareholders, except to the extent that cash is paid to Danaher stockholders in lieu of fractional shares. Unanticipated developments, including delays in obtaining or satisfying (or failure to obtain or satisfy) tax rulings, regulatory approvals, NetScout shareholder approval and other conditions to closing, and challenges in establishing infrastructure or processes, could delay or prevent the proposed transaction or cause the proposed transaction to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable and/or different than expected. On December 24, 2014, NetScout received a request for additional information (“second request”) from the U.S. Department of Justice. The effect of the second request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the Hart–Scott–Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act until 30 days after both NetScout and Danaher have substantially complied with the request, unless that period is extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated sooner by the U.S. Department of Justice. Even if the transaction is completed, some or all of the anticipated value and benefits therefrom may not be achieved. Expenses incurred to accomplish the proposed transaction may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate. Executing the proposed transaction also requires significant time and attention from management, which could distract them from other tasks in operating our business. Following the proposed separation and merger, the combined value of the common stock of Danaher and the shares of common stock of NetScout issued as consideration for our communications business may not be equal to or greater than what the value of Danaher’s common stock would have been had the proposed transaction not occurred.19Table of ContentsCertain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. FDA and by comparable agencies of other countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information. Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements.Certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the U.S. FDA, by comparable agencies of other countries and regions and by regulations governing radioactive or other hazardous materials (or the manufacture and sale of products containing such materials). We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approvals (such as 510(k) clearance) for our new products or modifications to (or additional indications or uses of) existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be time-consuming, costly and subject to restrictions. Our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors, for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results, and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained. Failure to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products (or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products), other violations of these regulations, real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products (even after obtaining clearance for distribution) and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to FDA Form 483 Inspectional Observations, warning letters, notices to customers, declining sales, loss of customers, loss of market share, recalls, seizures of adulterated or misbranded products, injunctions, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, narrowing of permitted uses for a product, suspension or withdrawal of approvals and pre-market notification rescissions. We are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse, pricing and sales and marketing practices in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information, including the federal regulations described in “Item 1 - Business - Regulatory Matters.” Many states and foreign countries have also adopted laws and regulations similar to, and in some cases more stringent than, such federal regulations. For more information regarding regulations we are subject to please see “Item 1 - Business - Regulatory Matters.”Failure to comply with the regulations described above could result in the adverse effects referenced below under “Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation.” Compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses.The healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, which could adversely affect our financial statements.The healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, including the following:•many of our customers, and the end-users to whom our customers supply products, rely on government funding of and reimbursement for healthcare products and services and research activities. The U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “PPACA”), healthcare austerity measures in other countries and other potential healthcare reform changes and government austerity measures may reduce the amount of government funding or reimbursement available to customers or end-users of our products and services and/or the volume of medical procedures using our products and services. Global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement.•the PPACA imposes a 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States as well as reporting and disclosure requirements on medical device manufacturers.•governmental and private healthcare providers and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the delivery of healthcare services, forming group purchasing organizations to improve their purchasing leverage and using competitive bid processes to procure healthcare products and services.These changes as well as other impacts from market demand, government regulations, third party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures have increased our tax liabilities and may cause participants in the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services, reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products services from governmental agencies or third-party payors, reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services and increase our compliance and other costs. In addition, we may be unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us, and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability. All of the factors described above could adversely affect our financial statements.20Table of ContentsOur operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements.Our operations, products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use, generation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the United States and abroad in connection with our operations. We cannot assure you that our environmental, health and safety compliance program has been or will at all times be effective. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements.In addition, we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. We may also become subject to additional remedial, compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules. For additional information regarding these risks, please refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. However, based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2014 will have a material effect on our financial statements.Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation.In addition to the environmental, health, safety, healthcare, medical device, anticorruption and other regulations noted above, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional levels, including the following:•we are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons and dealings between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory.•we also have agreements to sell products and services to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with government entities. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. Our agreements with government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification at the convenience of the government or in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors, and we may underestimate our costs of performing under the contract. Government contracts that have been awarded to us following a bid process could become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder, which could result in loss of the contract. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts. These are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. The regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. We, our representatives and the industries in which we operate may at times be under review and/or investigation by regulatory authorities. Failure to comply (or any alleged or perceived failure to comply) with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and any such failure or alleged failure (or becoming subject to a regulatory enforcement investigation) could also damage to our reputation, disrupt our business, limit our ability to manufacture, import, export and sell products and services, result in loss of customers and disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. Compliance with these and other regulations may also affect our returns on investment, require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our business. Our products and operations are also often 21Table of Contentssubject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the International Standards Organization, and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our financial statements. For additional information regarding these risks, please refer to “Item 1. Business - Regulatory Matters.”We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.As of December 31, 2014, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $24.3 billion. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets, changes in the structure of our business, divestitures, market capitalization declines, or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized. Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements.Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar (such as the strengthening that has taken place in recent periods) increases the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products and services we purchase overseas. Sales and expenses of our non-U.S. businesses are also translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects. In addition, certain of our businesses may invoice customers in a currency other than the business' functional currency, and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable translation effects. The Company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries.Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Please see the MD&A for a discussion of the factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period. The impact of these factors may be substantially different from period to period. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities, such as the audits described in the MD&A and the Company's financial statements. Due to the potential for changes to tax laws (or changes to the interpretation thereof) and the ambiguity of tax laws, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our intercompany arrangements and other factors, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. If these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected. If we determine to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have been considered permanently re-invested under existing accounting standards, it could also increase our effective tax rate. In addition, any significant change to the tax system in the U.S. or in other jurisdictions, including changes in the taxation of international income, could adversely affect our financial statements.We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements.We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiture-related matters, as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement. We may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, divested businesses. These lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. In addition, developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. We cannot 22Table of Contentsassure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation. However, based on our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2014 will have a material effect on our financial statements.If we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our business. The intellectual property rights that we obtain, however, may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. In addition, the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented, designed-around or becoming subject to compulsory licensing, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons, or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements.Third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.From time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. Any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to critical technology, be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services, be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements. Even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our financial statements.Defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products (including software) or services could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.Manufacturing or design defects or ""bugs"" in, unanticipated use of, safety or quality issues (or the perception of such issues) with respect to, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell (including items that we source from third parties) can lead to personal injury, death, property damage or other liability. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts, result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us. Recalls, removals and product liability and similar claims (regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome) can result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services.The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products, our reputation, business and financial statements could suffer.The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters and environmental factors, and if not discovered before the product is released to market could result in recalls and product liability exposure. Because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities, an alternative manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity. Any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant costs and liability, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products.23Table of ContentsOur indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow, and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements.As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $3.5 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, based on the availability under our credit facilities as of December 31, 2014, we had the ability to incur an additional $1.7 billion of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facilities. Our debt level and related debt service obligations can have negative consequences, including (1) requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and capital investment; (2) reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and (3) exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. We may incur significantly more debt in the future, particularly to finance acquisitions, and there can be no assurance that our cost of funding will not substantially increase. Our current revolving credit facility and long-term debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us; for more information please refer to the MD&A. If we breach any of these restrictions and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements. In addition, any failure to maintain the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies would adversely affect our cost of funds and could adversely affect our liquidity and access to the capital markets. If we add new debt, the risks described above could increase.Adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition, performance, purchasing patterns or inventory levels of, key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements.Certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and end-users. Some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors' products or compete with us directly, and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. Adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners, or adverse developments in their financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns, could adversely affect our financial statements. The levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners, and changes in those levels, can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period. In addition, the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries could adversely impact our profitability.Our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations.As discussed in “Item 1. Business - Materials,” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components, raw materials and other commodities. Prices for and availability of these components, raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past. Any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business. In addition, due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve, the cost-containment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to, if commodity prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions, or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs, we could experience lower margins and profitability and our financial statements could be adversely affected. If we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand, our profitability may suffer. In addition, our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials, components and services could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies.We purchase materials, components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations. Our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations, including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality. During a market upturn, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices. If we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand, we may not be able to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed, our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities. Conversely, in order to secure supplies for the production of products, we sometimes enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer.24Table of ContentsIn addition, some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers (including freight carriers) for reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. If these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, war, terrorist actions, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes. Any of these factors could result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies.Because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements. Any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our profitability.Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses.We compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional regulations, such as regulations governing health and safety, the environment, food and drugs, privacy and electronic communications. We develop, configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. Any significant change in any of these regulations (or in the interpretation or application thereof) could reduce demand for, increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services, or could restrict our existing activities, products and services. In addition, in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations. In these markets, the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations, or the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address, could adversely affect demand. In addition, regulatory deadlines may result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period to period.Work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations.We have a number of U.S. collective bargaining units and various non-U.S. collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our productivity, results of operations and reputation.International economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements.In 2014, approximately 57% of our sales were derived from customers outside the U.S. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located outside the U.S. Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the U.S. and increase the localization of our products and services, we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the U.S., particularly in the high-growth markets. Our international business (and particularly our business in high-growth markets) is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations, including:•interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers; •differences in terms of sale, including payment terms;•local product preferences and product requirements;•changes in a country's or region's political or economic conditions, such as the recent devaluation of the Russian ruble, the effects of the international sanctions that have recently been imposed upon Russia and the elimination of the Swiss Franc’s cap against the Euro;•trade protection measures, embargoes and import or export restrictions and requirements;•unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including negative changes in tax laws;•limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash;•the potential for nationalization of enterprises;•changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs;25Table of Contents•limitations on legal rights and our ability to enforce such rights;•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;•differing labor regulations;•difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis; and•differing protection of intellectual property.Any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and growth.If we suffer loss to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed.Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, public health crisis, war, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. If any of these facilities, supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses. The third-party insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses.A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. These systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. In addition, security breaches of our systems (or the systems of our customers, suppliers or other business partners) could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers. Like many multinational corporations, our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent. Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements.The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets, investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements. In addition, upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare coverage to current employees and retirees may increase our future funding obligations and adversely affect our financial statements.ITEM 1B.

Our payment of dividends in the future will be determined by our Board of Directors and will depend on business conditions, our earnings and other factors. Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesNeither the Company nor any “affiliated purchaser” repurchased any shares of Company common stock during 2014.

There is no expiration date for the 2013 Repurchase Program, and the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will be determined by the Company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The 2013 Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Company's equity compensation plans (or any successor plan) and for other corporate purposes.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide a reader of Danaher’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of Company management. The Company’s MD&A is divided into five sections:•Overview•Results of Operations•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Critical Accounting Estimates•New Accounting StandardsOVERVIEWGeneralPlease see “Item 1. Business – General” for a discussion of Danaher’s objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value. Danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations. During 2014, approximately 57% of Danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the United States. As a diversified, global business, Danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors. Danaher’s geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of its products and services, typically help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results. Given the broad range of products manufactured, software and services provided and geographies served, management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the Company. The Company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.As a result of the Company’s geographic and industry diversity, the Company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges, including rapid technological development (particularly with respect to computing, mobile connectivity, communications and digitization) in most of the Company’s served markets, the expansion and evolution of opportunities in high-growth markets, trends and costs associated with a global labor force, consolidation of the Company’s competitors and increasing regulation. The Company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and the Company’s long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in high-growth geographies and high-growth market segments, identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative and differentiated new products, services and software with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of the Company’s sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment. The Company is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources (particularly in high-growth markets) in order to be responsive to the Company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the Company’s operations. Business Performance and OutlookWhile differences exist among the Company’s businesses, on an overall basis, demand for the Company’s products, software and services increased in 2014 compared to 2013 driving year-over-year sales growth from existing businesses. The Company’s continued investments in sales growth initiatives and the other business-specific factors discussed below also contributed to year-over-year sales growth. Geographically, year-over-year sales growth rates from existing businesses during 2014 were led primarily by the high-growth markets. Sales from existing businesses in high-growth markets grew at a mid-single digit rate in 2014 compared to 2013 and sales from high-growth markets represented approximately 26% of the Company's total sales in 2014. Sales from existing businesses in developed markets grew at a low-single digit rate in 2014 compared to 2013 and were driven by North America and Western Europe. The Company expects overall sales growth to continue but remains cautious about challenges due to macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainties and global uncertainties related to monetary and fiscal policies. While individual business results will vary, the Company expects sales from existing businesses to continue to grow on a year-over-year basis during 2015 at a level in line with the growth levels experienced in 2014.31Table of ContentsRestructuring ActivitiesConsistent with the Company's approach of positioning itself to provide superior products and services to its customers in a cost efficient manner, in the second half of 2014 the Company initiated actions to improve productivity and reduce costs in its businesses. The actions, which were substantially completed by December 31, 2014, resulted in pre-tax charges of approximately $155 million, the majority of which was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2014. The charges, including both employee-related termination costs as well as other termination and exit costs, are expected to result in savings of approximately $125 million in 2015 compared to 2014 expense levels.In addition, the Company incurred $107 million of costs associated with restructuring activities in 2013 which resulted in savings of approximately $75 million in 2014 compared to 2013 expense levels. Acquisitions and DivestituresOn December 11, 2014, the Company successfully completed its tender offer for the outstanding shares of common stock of Nobel Biocare Holding AG, acquiring 97% of the outstanding shares for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately CHF 1.9 billion (approximately $1.9 billion based on exchange rates as of the date the shares of common stock were acquired) including debt assumed and net of cash acquired. Danaher is in the process of acquiring the remaining outstanding Nobel Biocare shares by means of a squeeze-out transaction, as permitted under Swiss law. Headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, Nobel Biocare is a world leader in the field of innovative implant-based dental restorations with a portfolio of solutions that include dental implant systems, high-precision individualized prosthetics, biomaterials and digital diagnostics, treatment planning and guided surgery. Nobel Biocare had revenues of €567 million in 2013 (approximately $780 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2013), and is now part of the Company's Dental segment. The Company financed the acquisition of Nobel Biocare from available cash.In addition to the acquisition of Nobel Biocare, during 2014 the Company acquired sixteen businesses for total consideration of approximately $1.3 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of the Test & Measurement, Environmental, Life Sciences & Diagnostics and Dental segments. The aggregate annual sales of these sixteen businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $420 million. In the fourth quarter of 2014, Danaher entered into a definitive agreement with NetScout to combine the majority of the Company's Test & Measurement segment's communications business with NetScout (Danaher will retain the data communications cable installation business and the communication service provider (field and test tool systems) business of Fluke Networks and these will become part of the Test & Measurement segment’s instruments business following the closing of the transaction). The transaction will be structured as a distribution of the communications business to Danaher shareholders in either a spin-off transaction, a split-off transaction, or a combination split-off and spin-off, followed by a merger of the communications business with a subsidiary of NetScout for consideration of 62.5 million NetScout shares, subject to adjustment. Both the distribution and merger are expected to qualify as tax-free transactions to Danaher and its shareholders, except to the extent that cash is paid to Danaher stockholders in lieu of fractional shares. If Danaher elects a spin-off, all Danaher shareholders will participate pro-rata. If Danaher elects a split-off, Danaher will conduct an exchange offer pursuant to which its shareholders will elect whether to exchange Danaher shares for common units of the communications business. If the split-off exchange offer is not fully subscribed, the additional common units of the communications business held by Danaher will be distributed in a spin-off on a pro rata basis to Danaher shareholders. Danaher will determine which approach it will take prior to closing the transaction and no decision has been made at this time. At closing, depending on the number of shares of NetScout common stock outstanding, Danaher shareholders will receive approximately 60% of the common shares of NetScout stock outstanding following the combination.The transaction remains subject to approval by NetScout’s shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of a material adverse change with respect to either the communications business or NetScout. On December 24, 2014, NetScout received a request for additional information (“second request”) from the U.S. Department of Justice. The effect of the second request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the Hart–Scott–Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act until 30 days after both NetScout and Danaher have substantially complied with the request, unless that period is extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated sooner by the U.S. Department of Justice. Upon the closing of the transaction, the Company will classify the communications business as a discontinued operation in its historical financial statements. Sales of the communications business to be combined with NetScout represented 22% of the sales of the Test & Measurement segment for the year ended December 31, 2014. The transaction is expected to be completed in 2015.32Table of ContentsIn August 2014, the Company completed the divestiture of its electric vehicle systems (""EVS"")/hybrid product line for a sale price of $87 million in cash. This product line, which was part of the Industrial Technologies segment, had revenues of approximately $60 million in 2014 prior to the divestiture and approximately $100 million in each of 2013 and 2012. Operating results of the product line were not significant to segment or overall Company reported results in 2014. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of the product line of $34 million ($26 million after-tax or $0.04 per diluted share) in its third quarter 2014 results. Subsequent to the sale, the Company has no continuing involvement in the EVS/hybrid product line. For a discussion of the Company’s 2013 and 2012 acquisition and divestiture activity, refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Investing Activities”.Sale of InvestmentsDuring 2014, the Company received cash proceeds of $167 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and recorded a pre-tax gain related to these sales of $123 million ($77 million after-tax or $0.11 per diluted share). RESULTS OF OPERATIONSConsolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased 4.0% compared to 2013. Sales from existing businesses contributed 3.5% growth and sales from acquired businesses contributed 1.5% growth on a year-over-year basis. The impact of currency translation reduced reported sales by 1.0% as the U.S. dollar was, on average, stronger against other major currencies during 2014 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2013. Consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 4.5% compared to 2012. Sales from existing businesses contributed 2.5% growth and sales from acquired businesses contributed 2.5% growth on a year-over-year basis. The impact of currency translation reduced reported sales by 0.5% as the U.S. dollar was, on average, stronger against other major currencies during 2013 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2012. In this report, references to sales from existing businesses refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) but excluding (1) sales from acquired businesses and (2) the impact of currency translation. References to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to GAAP sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales attributable to certain divested product lines not considered discontinued operations. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses) and (b) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. Sales from existing businesses should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting the non-GAAP financial measure of sales from existing businesses provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with our performance in prior and future periods and to our peers. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from sales from existing businesses because currency translation is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestiture related items because the nature, size and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period to period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. References to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales.Operating profit margins were 17.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 17.1% in 2013. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. 2014 vs. 2013 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by: •Higher 2014 sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2013 and 2014, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments - 65 basis points•The fourth quarter 2013 impairment of intangible assets associated with a technology investment in the communications business - 15 basis points 33Table of Contents2014 vs. 2013 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by: •Incremental year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives - 25 basis points •The incremental net dilutive effect in 2014 of acquired businesses and acquisition related charges recorded in 2014 associated with the Nobel Biocare acquisition, including transaction costs deemed significant and fair value adjustments to acquired inventory, net of the positive effect of the product line disposition in the third quarter of 2014 - 45 basis points The Company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant (generally relating to the Company’s larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for the Company in a given period.Operating profit margins were 17.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to 17.3% in 2012. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. 2013 vs. 2012 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by: •Higher 2013 sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2012 and 2013, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments - 80 basis points 2013 vs. 2012 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by: •The incremental net dilutive effect in 2013 of acquired businesses - 40 basis points •The divestiture of the Apex joint venture in 2013. Prior to the sale, the Company had accounted for its investment in Apex under the equity method - 40 basis points•The fourth quarter 2013 impairment of intangible assets associated with a technology investment in the communications business - 15 basis points •A 2012 gain relating to the resolution of contingencies with respect to a prior disposition of assets - 5 basis pointsBusiness SegmentsSales by business segment for the years ended December 31 are as follows ($ in millions): 2014 2013 2012Test & Measurement$3,461.9 $3,417.3 $3,381.0Environmental3,547.3 3,316.9 3,063.5Life Sciences & Diagnostics7,185.7 6,856.4 6,485.1Dental2,193.1 2,094.9 2,022.9Industrial Technologies3,525.8 3,432.5 3,307.9Total$19,913.8 $19,118.0 $18,260.4TEST & MEASUREMENTThe Company’s Test & Measurement segment offerings help customers design cutting-edge innovations, keep their businesses up and running and safeguard their network operations.

On an overall basis, sales from existing businesses in the segment’s instruments, mobile tool and wheel service businesses grew during 2014 as compared to 2013. This growth was more than offset by year-over-year sales declines in the segment's communications businesses.Sales from existing businesses in the segment's instruments business grew at a low-single digit rate during 2014 as compared to 2013, due to increased year-over-year sales of electrical and calibration products, primarily from strong sales of new product offerings. Geographically, growth was led by increased demand in North America, China, and Western Europe. Sales from existing businesses in the segment's communications business declined at a low-double digit rate during 2014 as compared to 2013 as certain large North American network management solutions customers are in the process of migrating to next-generation communication network technology infrastructures, and as a result delayed capital spending on their networks. The communications business is actively working with these customers to support this transition, including by increasing research and development investments to bring to market solutions for these customers’ next generation technology requirements. This decline in North America was slightly offset by growth in Western Europe and the Middle East. In addition, in the segment’s network security product line sales from existing businesses grew year-over-year, led by North America and Western Europe. The Company expects year-over-year sales growth from existing businesses in the segment's communications businesses for the full-year ending December 31, 2015, but expects sales growth from existing businesses to remain negative on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2015.As noted above, in the fourth quarter of 2014 Danaher entered into a definitive agreement with NetScout to combine Danaher’s communications business with NetScout. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to this transaction.Operating profit margins declined 60 basis points during 2014 as compared to 2013. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. 2014 vs. 2013 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:•2013 impact from the impairment of intangible assets associated with a technology investment in the communications business - 90 basis points35Table of Contents2014 vs. 2013 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by: •Lower sales volumes from existing businesses with respect to high margin communications sales as well as incremental year-over-year costs associated with various new product development, sales and marketing growth investments, net of incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2014 and 2013 - 30 basis points•Incremental year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives - 60 basis points•The incremental net dilutive effect in 2014 of acquired businesses - 60 basis points2013 COMPARED TO 2012 Price increases in the segment contributed 0.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2013 as compared to 2012 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.Sales in the segment's instrument business declined at a low-single digit rate during 2013 as compared to 2012, as lower demand for thermography, calibration and electronic test products more than offset modest increases in demand for industrial products. Decreased demand in the North American, European and Chinese end markets contributed to the decline in sales. However, the Company did see demand stabilize during the second half of 2013 as compared to the first half of 2013, particularly in Europe and North America. Sales in the segment's communications business grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2013 compared to 2012 with robust year-over-year increase in demand for network security and analysis solutions. Geographically, strong year-over-year demand in the North America and Latin America regions was somewhat offset by declines in demand in Asia. Operating profit margins declined 110 basis points during 2013 as compared to 2012. The favorable impacts of higher operating profit margin communication business products comprising a higher percentage of sales in 2013 compared to 2012 and lower year-over-year costs for restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives were offset by lower year-over-year instrument sales volumes and incremental year-over-year costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments. In addition, 2013 vs. 2012 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by: •The fourth quarter 2013 impairment of intangible assets associated with a technology investment in the communications business - 90 basis points•The incremental net dilutive effect in 2013 of acquired businesses - 20 basis points ENVIRONMENTALThe Company’s Environmental segment products and services help protect the global water supply, facilitate environmental stewardship, enhance the safety of personal data and improve business efficiencies.

Demand in the clinical business increased on a year over-year-basis led by continuing strong demand in China and other high-growth markets and a return to growth in North America. Continued strong global consumable sales in 2014 related to the installed base of acute care instruments drove the majority of the year-over-year sales growth in the acute care diagnostic business, which was led by China and other high-growth markets as well as modest increases in Western Europe. Increased demand for advanced staining systems and consumables across all major geographies drove the majority of the year-over-year sales growth in the pathology diagnostics business. Slight overall increases in demand for core histology instruments, led by North America, also contributed to this growth.38Table of ContentsSales from existing businesses in the segment's life sciences business grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to continued strong demand for the business' recently introduced products. Geographically, sales grew on a year-over-year basis in North America and Western Europe but declined in China and Japan. Sales of the business' broad range of mass spectrometers continued to grow on a year-over-year basis led by strong sales growth in the applied markets in North America and Western Europe. Sales of confocal, stereo and surgical microscopy products increased on a year-over-year basis led by strong demand in the developed markets. Year-over-year demand for the business' cellular analysis and sample preparation product lines grew at a low single digit rate in 2014, led by increases in demand in North America and Western Europe that, were largely offset by sales declines in China and Japan.

The clinical diagnostics business experienced strong sales of consumables and automation hardware in high-growth markets, particularly China, that more than offset slightly negative year-over-year sales performance in North America and Europe. Sales growth in the acute care diagnostic business was due primarily to continued robust global consumables sales related to the business' growing installed base of instrumentation as well as strong demand for compact blood gas analyzers and cardiac care instruments. The year-over-year sales growth in the pathology diagnostics business was driven by strong demand for advanced staining systems and consumables in North America, China and Japan and increased demand for core histology instruments and consumables in North America and China. Sales from existing businesses in the segment's life sciences business grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2013 as compared to 2012 due primarily to strong demand for new product introductions across the life sciences businesses. Fourth quarter 2013 growth rates lagged full year growth rates due to comparisons to the same period in 2012 which benefited from new product introductions. Sales of the business' broad range of mass spectrometers grew on a year-over-year basis as strong sales growth in the applied and clinical research markets and the pharmaceutical market were partially offset by sales declines in the academic research market. Geographically, year-over-year sales growth in the mass spectrometry business was strong in high-growth markets and in the second half of 2013 the business also experienced strong demand in Europe and Japan. The business' confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and sample preparation product lines also contributed to year-over-year growth, principally from demand in high-growth markets.

In 2013, the U.S. imposed a 2.3% excise tax on the sale or importation of certain medical devices, which affected various products in the Company's Life Sciences & Diagnostics and Dental segments. The excise tax increased the Company's 2013 cost of sales as a percentage of revenue on a year-over-year basis by approximately 20 basis points. The impact of the medical devices excise tax was partially mitigated by general price increases implemented during 2013.Gross profit margins increased 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis during 2014 as compared to 2013, due primarily to the favorable impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continued productivity improvements taken in 2013 and 2014, partially offset by acquisition related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory in connection with the acquisition of Nobel Biocare during the fourth quarter of 2014 and incremental year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives.Gross profit margins increased 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2013 as compared to 2012, due primarily to the favorable impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes and the year-over-year decline in costs relating to restructuring actions and continued productivity improvements. The excise tax noted above increased the Company's 2013 cost of sales as a percentage of revenue on a year-over-year basis by approximately 20 basis points.

In addition, transaction costs incurred in connection with the closing of the Nobel Biocare acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2014 unfavorably impacted the year-over-year comparison 43Table of Contentsby approximately five basis points. These increases were partially offset by the benefit of increased leverage of the Company's general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2014 sales, the effect of the 2013 impairment charge related to intangible assets associated with a communications business' technology investment and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with 2013 and 2014 restructuring actions.

The benefit of increased leverage of the Company's cost base resulting from higher 2013 sales and the year-over-year decline in restructuring costs was offset by incremental year-over-year increases in investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives. Year-over-year comparisons were also adversely impacted by an impairment charge related to intangible assets associated with a communications business' technology investment which increased selling, general and administrative expenses by 15 basis points in 2013. Research and development expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) as a percentage of sales increased 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis in 2014 as compared to 2013. Incremental year-over-year increases in investments in the Company's new product development initiatives were the primary contributors to this increase. Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales increased 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis in 2013 as compared to 2012 due primarily to new product development initiatives. OTHER INCOME During 2014, the Company received cash proceeds of $167 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and recorded a pre-tax gain related to these sales of $123 million ($77 million after-tax or $0.11 per diluted share). In addition, the Company completed the divestiture of its EVS/hybrid product line for a sale price of $87 million in cash in August 2014. This product line, which was part of the Industrial Technologies segment, had revenues of approximately $60 million in 2014 prior to the divestiture and approximately $100 million in each of 2013 and 2012. Operating results of the product line were not significant to segment or overall Company reported results in 2014. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of the product line of $34 million ($26 million after-tax or $0.04 per diluted share) in its third quarter 2014 results. Subsequent to the sale, the Company has no continuing involvement in the EVS/hybrid product line. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company sold approximately 5 million of the approximately 8 million shares of Align Technology, Inc. (""Align"") common stock that the Company received in 2009 as a result of a settlement between Align and Ormco Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company received cash proceeds of $251 million from the sale of these marketable equity securities and recorded a pre-tax gain of $202 million ($125 million after-tax or $0.18 per diluted share). On July 4, 2010, the Company entered into a joint venture with Cooper Industries, plc (“Cooper”), combining certain of the Company’s hand tool businesses with Cooper’s Tools business to form a new entity called Apex Tool Group, LLC (“Apex”). Each of Cooper and the Company had owned a 50% interest in Apex, had an equal number of representatives on Apex’s Board of Directors and neither joint venture partner controlled the significant operating and financing activities of Apex. The Company had accounted for its investment in the joint venture based on the equity method of accounting. During 2012, the Company recorded $70 million of earnings from unconsolidated joint venture related to its interest in Apex. In February 2013, the Company and Cooper sold Apex to an unrelated third party for approximately $1.6 billion. The Company received $797 million from the sale, consisting of cash of $759 million (including $67 million of dividends received prior to closing) and a note receivable of $38 million (which has been subsequently collected). The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $230 million ($144 million after-tax or $0.20 per diluted share) in its first quarter 2013 results in connection with this transaction. The Company's share of the 2013 earnings generated by Apex prior to the closing of the sale was insignificant. Subsequent to the sale of its investment in Apex, the Company has no continuing involvement in Apex's operations. INTEREST COSTSFor a description of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness, refer to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities and Indebtedness” below.Interest expense of $123 million for 2014 was $23 million lower than in 2013, due primarily to the repayment of the $400 million principal amount of 1.3% senior unsecured notes due 2014 (the ""2014 Notes"") upon maturity in June 2014 in addition to the repayment of the €500 million principal amount of Eurobond notes due 2013 (the ""Eurobond Notes"") and the $300 million principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2013 (the ""2013 Notes"") upon maturity in July and June 2013, respectively. Interest expense of $146 million in 2013 was $12 million lower than the 2012 interest expense of $158 million due primarily to the repayment of the Eurobond Notes and the 2013 Notes. 44Table of ContentsInterest income was $17 million, $6 million and $3 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in interest income in 2014 compared to prior periods reflects higher overall cash holdings throughout 2014 compared to 2013 and 2012.INCOME TAXESGeneralIncome tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the Company’s financial statements. The Company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.The Company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws. For a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, refer to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash and Cash Requirements” below.The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis. Based on these reviews, the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities, tax rulings and court decisions, and the expiration of statutes of limitations, reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary. For a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.Year-Over-Year Changes in the Tax Provision and Effective Tax RateThe Company’s effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was 25.4%, 24.4% and 23.6%, respectively.The Company’s effective tax rate for each of 2014, 2013 and 2012 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35.0% due principally to the Company’s earnings outside the United States that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate. The effective tax rates for 2014 and 2013 also include the benefit from the reinstatement of certain tax benefits and credits resulting from the enactments of the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 and the America Tax Relief Act of 2012. In addition, the effective tax rate of 25.4% in 2014 includes tax expense for audit settlements in various jurisdictions and changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions, partially offset by the release of valuation allowances and the release of reserves upon the expiration of statutes of limitations. The effective tax rates of 24.4% in 2013 and 23.6% in 2012 include recognition of tax benefits associated with favorable resolutions of certain international and domestic uncertain tax positions and the lapse of certain statutes of limitations, partially offset by adjustments of reserve estimates related to prior period uncertain tax positions. The matters referenced above have been treated as discrete items in the periods they occurred and in the aggregate increased the provision for income taxes by approximately 165 basis points in 2014 and reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately 20 basis points in 2013 and 30 basis points in 2012.The Company conducts business globally, and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the United States federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. The countries in which the Company has a significant presence that have significantly lower statutory tax rates than the United States include China, Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom. The Company's ability to obtain a tax benefit from lower statutory tax rates outside of the United States is dependent on its levels of taxable income in these foreign countries. The Company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements given the geographic dispersion of the Company's taxable income.The Company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed examinations of certain of the Company's federal income tax returns through 2009 and is currently examining certain of the Company's federal income tax returns for 2010 and 2011. The Company's U.S. tax returns for 2012 and 2013 remain open for examination by the IRS. In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, the United Kingdom and various other countries, states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2002 through 2013.45Table of ContentsTax authorities in Denmark have raised significant issues related to interest accrued by certain of the Company's subsidiaries. On December 10, 2013, the Company received assessments from the Danish tax authority (“SKAT”) totaling approximately DKK 1.2 billion (approximately $190 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2014) including interest through December 31, 2014, imposing withholding tax relating to interest accrued in Denmark on borrowings from certain of the Company's subsidiaries for the years 2004-2009. If the SKAT claims are successful, it is likely that the Company would be assessed additional amounts for years 2010-2012 totaling approximately DKK 650 million (approximately $106 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2014). Management believes the positions the Company has taken in Denmark are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and intends to vigorously defend its positions. The Company appealed these assessments with the National Tax Tribunal in 2014 and intends on pursuing this matter through the European Court of Justice should this appeal be unsuccessful. The ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, could take many years, and could result in a material adverse impact to the Company's financial statements, including its effective tax rate.As previously disclosed, German tax authorities had raised issues related to the deductibility and taxability of interest accrued by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the German tax authorities to resolve these open matters through 2014. The Company recorded €49 million (approximately $60 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2014) of expense for taxes and interest related to this settlement during the fourth quarter of 2014. The Company's effective tax rate for 2015 is expected to be approximately 24.0%. This anticipated rate reflects no benefit from the research and experimentation credit in the United States which expired at the end of 2014.COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEComprehensive income decreased by $2.0 billion for 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to most major currencies during the year, in addition to pension and post-retirement plan benefit adjustments. The Company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $1.2 billion for 2014 compared to a translation loss of $62 million for 2013. Pension and post-retirement plan benefit adjustments resulted in a loss of $361 million in 2014 compared to a gain of $289 million in 2013. Comprehensive income increased by $599 million for 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily due to increased net earnings for 2013 and the impact of pension and post-retirement plan benefit adjustments. The Company recorded a pension and post-retirement plan benefit gain of $289 million for 2013 compared to a loss of $140 million for 2012.INFLATIONThe effect of inflation on the Company’s revenues and net earnings was not significant in any of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 or 2012.FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENTThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit risk, equity prices and commodity prices, each of which could impact its financial statements. The Company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. In addition, the Company’s broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole.Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. A change in interest rates on long-term debt impacts the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt but not the Company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2014, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt (excluding the LYONs, which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from the value of its underlying common stock) by approximately $90 million. However, since the Company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturity, the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt does not affect the Company’s results of operations or stockholders’ equity.46Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2014, the Company’s variable-rate debt obligations consisted primarily of U.S. dollar and Euro-based commercial paper borrowings (refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2014). As a result, the Company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term interest rates. As these shorter duration obligations mature, the Company anticipates issuing additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. In 2014, a 10% increase in average market interest rates on the Company’s commercial paper borrowings would have increased the Company’s interest expense by approximately $0.1 million. A 10% hypothetical fluctuation is used as the Company’s actual commercial paper interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2014. Currency Exchange Rate RiskThe Company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than Danaher’s functional currency or the functional currency of our applicable subsidiary. The Company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars, Danaher’s functional currency. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the Company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2014 would have resulted in a reduction of stockholders’ equity of approximately $1.0 billion.Currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2014 reported sales by 1.0% on a year-over-year basis as the U.S. dollar was, on average, stronger against most major currencies during 2014 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2013. If the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2014 were to prevail throughout 2015, currency exchange rates would adversely impact 2015 estimated sales by approximately 3.5% relative to the Company’s performance in 2014 due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. Additional strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would further adversely impact the Company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis. Any weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would positively impact the Company’s sales and results of operations. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales, profit, and assets and liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.On April 2, 2014, the Company terminated the Japanese Yen/U.S. dollar currency swap agreement that had been acquired in connection with a prior business acquisition. The currency swap agreement initially required the Company to purchase approximately 184 million Japanese Yen (JPY/¥) at a rate of $1/¥102.25 on a monthly basis through June 1, 2018. The currency swap did not qualify for hedge accounting, and as a result, changes in the fair value of the currency swap were reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings each reporting period. The fair value of the currency swap as of the termination date was not significant and the fair value had not changed significantly during 2014 prior to the swap being terminated. During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company recorded pre-tax income of $14 million and $22 million, respectively, related to changes in the fair value of this currency swap. Credit RiskThe Company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, receivables from customers and derivatives. The Company places cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the third party depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.47Table of ContentsIn addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the Company’s customers. The Company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate.The Company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and, with the exception of the Yen swap noted above, such transactions are generally insignificant to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. These transactions are entered into only with high-quality financial institutions and exposure at any one institution is limited.Equity Price RiskThe Company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio includes publicly traded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale investments due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the equity securities. A 10% decline in the value of these equity securities as of December 31, 2014 would have reduced the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio by $26 million.Commodity Price RiskFor a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices, refer “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESManagement assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses, consummating strategic acquisitions, paying interest and servicing debt and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. Following is an overview of the Company's cash flows and liquidity for the years ended December 31: Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity ($ in millions)2014 2013 2012Total operating cash flows provided by continuing operations$3,758.4 $3,585.3 $3,502.1 Cash paid for acquisitions$(3,130.9) $(957.2) $(1,796.8)Payments for additions to property, plant and equipment(597.5) (551.5) (458.3)Proceeds from sales of investments and a product line253.8 958.6 —Proceeds from sale of discontinued operations— — 337.5All other investing activities30.3 (2.4) 30.0Net cash used in investing activities$(3,444.3) $(552.5) $(1,887.6) Proceeds from the issuance of common stock$132.9 $177.4 $212.0Payment of dividends(227.7) (52.1) (86.4)Purchase of stock— — (648.4)Net proceeds from (repayments of) borrowings (maturities of 90 days or less)312.2 (763.3) 195.9Repayments of borrowings (maturities longer than 90 days)(414.7) (967.8) (61.5)All other financing activities(20.9) — —Net cash used in financing activities$(218.2) $(1,605.8) $(388.4)•Operating cash flows from continuing operations increased $173 million, or approximately 5%, during 2014 as compared to 2013. Cash flow increases generated from higher operating profit, as well as higher non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization, were largely offset by increased investments in working capital. In addition, operating cash flows for 2013 benefited from $67 million of dividends received related to earnings of the Apex joint venture.48Table of Contents•Cash paid for acquisitions constituted the most significant use of cash during 2014. The Company acquired seventeen businesses during 2014, including the acquisition of Nobel Biocare, for total consideration (net of cash acquired) of approximately $3.1 billion.•During 2014, the Company received cash proceeds of $254 million from the sale of certain marketable securities and the divestiture of its EVS/hybrid product line.•As of December 31, 2014, the Company held $3.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents.Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows.Operating cash flows from continuing operations were $3.8 billion for 2014, an increase of $173 million, or 5% as compared to 2013. The year-over-year change in operating cash flows from 2013 to 2014 was primarily attributable to the following factors:•2014 operating cash flows benefited from higher net earnings as compared to 2013 excluding the impacts of the gains included in other non-operating income in both years. While these non-operating gains are included in earnings, the proceeds from the sales of investments, product lines and discontinued operations are reflected in the investing activities section of the Statement of Cash Flows and, therefore, do not contribute to operating cash flows.•The aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable provided $27 million in operating cash flows during 2014, compared to $197 million provided in 2013. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively the Company manages the cash conversion cycle, which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day it pays for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from its customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period.•Net earnings for 2014 reflected an increase of $44 million of depreciation and amortization expense as compared to 2013. Amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions. Depreciation expense relates to both the Company's manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operating-type lease arrangements. Depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows.•2013 operating cash flows included $67 million of dividends received related to earnings of the Apex joint venture, which was sold in 2013. These dividends increased the 2013 operating cash flows but did not repeat in 2014 due to the sale.Operating cash flows from continuing operations were $3.6 billion for 2013, an increase of $83 million, or 2% as compared to 2012. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in operating profit in 2013 as compared to 2012. Investing ActivitiesCash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures, including instruments leased to customers, and cash proceeds from divestitures of businesses or assets.Net cash used in investing activities was $3.4 billion during 2014 compared to $553 million and $1.9 billion of net cash used in 2013 and 2012, respectively.Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of Investments2014 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of InvestmentsFor a discussion of the Company’s 2014 acquisitions, divestitures and the sale of certain marketable equity securities, refer to “—Overview.”49Table of Contents2013 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of InvestmentsDuring 2013, the Company acquired fourteen businesses for total consideration of $957 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of the Industrial Technologies, Life Sciences & Diagnostics, Environmental and Test & Measurement segments. The aggregate annual sales of these fourteen businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $300 million.During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company sold approximately 5 million of the approximately 8 million shares of Align common stock that the Company received in 2009 as a result of a settlement between Align and Ormco. The Company received cash proceeds of $251 million from the sale of these securities and recorded a pre-tax gain of $202 million ($125 million after-tax or $0.18 per diluted share). On July 4, 2010, the Company entered into a joint venture with Cooper, combining certain of the Company’s hand tool businesses with Cooper’s Tools business to form a new entity, Apex. In February 2013, the Company and Cooper sold Apex to an unrelated third party for approximately $1.6 billion. The Company received $797 million from the sale, consisting of cash of $759 million (including $67 million of dividends received prior to closing) and a note receivable of $38 million (which has been subsequently collected). The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $230 million ($144 million after-tax or $0.20 per diluted share) in its first quarter 2013 results in connection with this transaction. 2012 Acquisitions and DivestituresDuring 2012, the Company acquired fourteen businesses for total consideration of $1.8 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company's five segments. The aggregate annual sales of these fourteen businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the acquired company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $666 million. In January 2012, the Company completed the sale of its integrated scanning system business (the ASI business) for $132 million in cash. In addition, in February 2012, the Company completed the sale of its KEO business for $205 million in cash. These businesses were part of the Industrial Technologies segment. The businesses had combined annual revenues of $275 million in 2011. The Company recorded an aggregate after-tax gain on the sale of these businesses of $94 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in its first quarter 2012 results. The Company has reported the ASI and KEO businesses as discontinued operations in its consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the results of operations for all periods presented reflect these businesses as discontinued operations. Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development, improving information technology systems and the manufacture of instruments that are used in operating-type lease arrangements that certain of the Company’s businesses enter into with customers. Capital expenditures totaled $598 million in 2014, $552 million in 2013 and $458 million in 2012. The increase in capital spending in 2014 and 2013 is due primarily to increases in equipment leased to customers. In 2015, the Company expects capital spending to be between $650 million and $700 million, though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions.Financing Activities and IndebtednessCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper, common stock and debt, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, payments of principal on indebtedness, payments for repurchases of common stock and payments of cash dividends to shareholders. Financing activities used cash of $218 million during 2014 compared to $1.6 billion of cash used during 2013. The year-over-year decrease was due primarily to the incrementally lower year-over-year repayment of borrowings with maturities longer than 90 days and incrementally higher year-over-year net proceeds received from the issuance of commercial paper borrowings. The Company repaid the 2014 Notes upon their maturity in June 2014. 50Table of ContentsTotal debt was $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. The Company’s debt as of December 31, 2014 was as follows:•$765 million of outstanding commercial paper;•$500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.3% senior unsecured notes due 2016 (the “2016 Notes”);•$500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2018 (the “2018 Notes”);•$750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.4% senior unsecured notes due 2019 (the “2019 Notes”);•$600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.9% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes” and together with the 2016 Notes, the “2011 Financing Notes”);•$130 million (CHF 120 million aggregate principal amount) of 4.0% bonds due 2016 (the “2016 Bonds”);•$111 million of zero coupon Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2021 (“LYONs”); and•$118 million of other borrowings.The 2011 Financing Notes, the 2018 Notes and the 2019 Notes are collectively referred to as the “Notes”.Commercial Paper Programs and Credit FacilityThe Company satisfies any short-term liquidity needs that are not met through operating cash flow and available cash primarily through issuances of commercial paper under its U.S. and Euro commercial paper programs. Under these programs, the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes. Interest expense on the notes is paid at maturity and is generally based on the ratings assigned to the Company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to LIBOR. Borrowings under the program are available for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. During 2014, as commercial paper balances matured the Company either paid such balances from available cash or refinanced such balances by issuing new commercial paper. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had $450 million in U.S. dollar denominated commercial paper outstanding and $315 million (€260 million) of commercial paper outstanding under the Euro commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2014, borrowings outstanding under the Company’s U.S. and Euro commercial paper programs had a weighted average annual interest rate of 0.13% and a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately twelve days. Commercial paper outstanding at any one time during the year had balances ranging from $450 million to $822 million, carried interest at annual rates ranging between 0.04% and 0.2% and had original maturities between seven and thirty-four days. The Company has classified its borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program as of December 31, 2014 as long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company had the intent and ability, as supported by availability under the Credit Facility referenced below, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date.Credit support for the commercial paper program is provided by a $2.5 billion unsecured multi-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that expires on July 15, 2016 (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Under the Credit Facility, borrowings (other than bid loans) bear interest at a rate equal to (at the Company’s option) either (1) a LIBOR-based rate plus a margin that varies according to the Company’s long-term debt credit rating (the “Eurodollar Rate”), or (2) the highest of (a) the Federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (b) the prime rate and (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1%, plus in each case a margin that varies according to the Company’s long-term debt credit rating. In addition to certain initial fees the Company paid at inception of the Credit Facility, the Company is obligated to pay an annual commitment fee that varies according to its long-term debt credit rating. The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the facility) of 0.65 to 1.00 or less, and also contains customary representations, warranties, conditions precedent, events of default, indemnities and affirmative and negative covenants. As of December 31, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Facility and the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the facility. The non-performance by any member of the Credit Facility syndicate would reduce the maximum capacity of the Credit Facility by such member's commitment amount. In addition to the Credit Facility, the Company has entered into reimbursement agreements with various commercial banks to support the issuance of letters of credit.The availability of the Credit Facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of the Company’s commercial paper programs. The Company expects to limit any borrowings under the Credit Facility to amounts that would leave sufficient credit available under the facility to allow the Company to borrow, if needed, to repay all of the outstanding commercial paper as it matures.51Table of ContentsThe Company’s ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related costs of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of the Company’s credit rating and market conditions. Any downgrade in the Company’s credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the Company’s commercial paper program and the Credit Facility, and could limit or preclude the Company’s ability to issue commercial paper. If the Company’s access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a downgrade, change in market conditions or otherwise, the Company expects it would rely on a combination of available cash, operating cash flow and the Company’s Credit Facility to provide short-term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under the Company’s Credit Facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings.Other Long-Term Indebtedness2013 Notes, 2014 Notes, 2016 Notes and 2021 Notes—On June 23, 2011, the Company completed the underwritten public offering of the 2011 Financing Notes, the 2013 Notes and the 2014 Notes, all of which are (or in the case of the 2013 Notes and 2014 Notes were) unsecured. The 2013 Notes were issued at 100% of their principal amount, accrued interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.25% per year and matured and were repaid in June 2013. The 2014 Notes were issued at 99.918% of their principal amount, accrued interest at the rate of 1.3% per year and matured and were repaid in June 2014. The 2016 Notes were issued at 99.84% of their principal amount, will mature on June 23, 2016 and accrue interest at the rate of 2.3% per year. The 2021 Notes were issued at 99.975% of their principal amount, will mature on June 23, 2021 and accrue interest at the rate of 3.9% per year. The net proceeds from the 2011 Financing Notes, 2013 Notes and 2014 Notes offering, after deducting expenses and the underwriters’ discount, were approximately $1.8 billion and were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Beckman Coulter. The Company paid interest on the 2013 Notes quarterly in arrears on March 21, June 21, September 21 and December 21 of each year. The Company paid interest on the 2014 Notes, and pays interest on the 2016 Notes and 2021 Notes semi-annually in arrears, on June 23 and December 23 of each year.2019 Notes—In March 2009, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of the 2019 Notes, which were issued at 99.93% of their principal amount, will mature on March 1, 2019 and accrue interest at the rate of 5.4% per year. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, were $745 million. A portion of the net proceeds were used to repay a portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial paper and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The Company pays interest on the 2019 Notes semi-annually in arrears, on March 1 and September 1 of each year.2018 Notes—In December 2007, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of the 2018 Notes, which were issued at 99.39% of their principal amount, will mature on January 15, 2018 and accrue interest at the rate of 5.625% per year. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, were $493 million, which were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance the acquisition of the Tektronix business. The Company pays interest on the 2018 Notes semi-annually in arrears, on January 15 and July 15 of each year.2016 Bonds—In connection with the acquisition of Nobel Biocare in December 2014, the Company acquired bonds with an aggregate principal amount of CHF 120 million and a stated interest rate of 4.0% per year. In accordance with accounting for business combinations, the bonds were recorded at their fair value of CHF 127 million ($133 million based on exchange rates in effect at the time of the acquisition), as such, for accounting purposes interest charges recorded in the Company's statement of earnings reflect an effective interest rate of approximately 0.2% per year. The Company will pay interest on the 2016 Bonds annually in arrears on October 10 of each year (based on the stated 4.0% interest rate). The 2016 Bonds mature on October 10, 2016. LYONs—In 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in LYONs. The net proceeds to the Company were $505 million, of which $100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The LYONs carry a yield to maturity of 2.375% (with contingent interest payable as described below). Holders of the LYONs may convert each $1,000 of principal amount at maturity into 29.0704 shares of the Company’s common stock (in the aggregate for all LYONs that were originally issued, approximately 24 million shares of the Company’s common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January 22, 2021. As of December 31, 2014, an aggregate of approximately 20 million shares of the Company’s common stock had been issued upon conversion of LYONs. As of December 31, 2014, the accreted value of the outstanding LYONs was lower than the traded market value of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time at scheduled redemption prices. Under the terms of the LYONs, the Company pays contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six month period from January 23 to July 22 and from July 23 to January 22 if the average market price of a LYON for a specified measurement period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. The amount of contingent interest to be paid with respect to any quarterly period is equal to the higher of either 0.0315% of the bonds’ average market price during the specified measurement period or the amount of the common stock dividend paid during such quarterly 52Table of Contentsperiod multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon conversion of a LYON. The Company paid $2 million, $1 million and $1 million of contingent interest on the LYONs for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Except for the contingent interest described above, the Company will not pay interest on the LYONs prior to maturity.Eurobond Notes—On July 21, 2006, a financing subsidiary of the Company issued the Eurobond Notes in a private placement outside the United States. Payment obligations under these Eurobond Notes were guaranteed by the Company. The net proceeds of the offering, after the deduction of underwriting commissions but prior to the deduction of other issuance costs, were €496 million ($627 million based on exchange rates in effect at the time the offering closed) and were used to pay down a portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The Eurobond Notes matured and were repaid in July 2013.Covenants and Redemption Provisions Applicable to the Notes and the 2016 BondsThe Company may redeem some or all of the 2016 Notes, the 2018 Notes and/or the 2019 Notes at any time by paying the principal amount and a “make-whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Prior to March 23, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), the Company may redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes by paying the principal amount and a “make-whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On or after March 23, 2021, the Company may redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes for their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. At any time after 85% or more of the 2016 Bonds have been redeemed or purchased and canceled, the Company may redeem some or all of the remaining 2016 Bonds for their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. If a change of control triggering event occurs with respect to the Notes, each holder of Notes may require the Company to repurchase some or all of its Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued interest. A change of control triggering event means the occurrence of both a change of control and a rating event, each as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture. Except in connection with a change of control triggering event as described above, the Company does not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt. The indentures pursuant to which the Notes were issued each contain customary covenants including, for example, limits on the incurrence of secured debt and sale/leaseback transactions, and the 2016 Bonds are subject to similar covenants. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to the Company’s operations and as of December 31, 2014, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants. For additional details regarding the Company’s debt as of December 31, 2014 see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Shelf Registration StatementThe Company has filed a “well-known seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance. The Company expects to use net proceeds realized by the Company from future securities sales off this shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, including without limitation repayment or refinancing of debt or other corporate obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends, and working capital. Stock Repurchase ProgramOn July 16, 2013, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new repurchase program (the “2013 Repurchase Program”) authorizing the repurchase of up to 20 million shares of the Company's common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The 2013 Repurchase Program replaced the repurchase program approved by the Company's Board of Directors in May 2010 (the “2010 Repurchase Program”). There is no expiration date for the 2013 Repurchase Program, and the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will be determined by the Company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The 2013 Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Company's equity compensation plans (or any successor plan) and for other corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2014, 20 million shares remained available for repurchase pursuant to the 2013 Repurchase Program. The Company expects to fund any future stock repurchases using the Company's available cash balances or proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper.Neither the Company nor any “affiliated purchaser” repurchased any shares of Company common stock during 2014 and 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company repurchased approximately 12.5 million shares of Company common stock under the 2010 Repurchase Program in open market transactions at a cost of $648 million. 53Table of ContentsDividendsThe Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share that was paid on January 30, 2015 to holders of record on December 26, 2014. Aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2014 were $228 million. Dividend payments were higher in 2014 as compared to 2013 as the Company increased its quarterly dividend rate in the first quarter of 2014 to $0.10 per share and because the Company made no cash payments for dividends during the first quarter of 2013. The Company's Board accelerated the quarterly dividend payment that normally would have been paid in January 2013 and paid it in December 2012. Cash and Cash RequirementsAs of December 31, 2014, the Company held approximately $3.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an approximate weighted average annual interest rate of 0.4%. Of this amount $813 million was held within the United States and approximately $2.2 billion was held outside of the United States. The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures and acquisitions, to pay interest and service debt, pay taxes and any related interest or penalties, fund its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock, pay dividends to shareholders and support other business needs. The Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, particularly in connection with acquisitions, the Company may also borrow under its commercial paper programs or the Credit Facility, enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper programs and/or access the capital markets. The Company also may from time to time access the capital markets, including to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions. While repatriation of some cash held outside the United States may be restricted by local laws, most of the Company's foreign cash balances could be repatriated to the United States but, under current law, could be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. For most of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company makes an election regarding the amount of earnings intended for indefinite reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. A deferred tax liability has been accrued for the funds that are available to be repatriated to the United States. No provisions for U.S. income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, and the amount of U.S. income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the Company could employ if it repatriated these earnings. The cash that the Company's foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments, including acquisitions. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately $11.8 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, management believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs, including its cash needs in the United States.During 2014, the Company contributed $52 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan and $62 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2015, the Company’s cash contribution requirements for its U.S. and its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately $25 million and $55 million, respectively. The ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan’s funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates and other factors.Contractual ObligationsThe following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations relating to continuing operations as of December 31, 2014 under (1) long-term debt obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company’s balance sheet under GAAP. The amounts presented in the table below do not reflect $804 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits. Certain of our acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table below does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts of any such payments are uncertain. Refer to “—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” for a discussion of other contractual obligations that are not reflected in the table below. 54Table of Contents($ in millions)Total Less ThanOne Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than5 YearsDebt & leases: Long-term debt obligations (a)(b)$3,440.5 $67.3 $1,397.4 $1,251.4 $724.4Capital lease obligations (b)32.9 4.6 10.6 8.8 8.9Total long-term debt3,473.4 71.9 1,408.0 1,260.2 733.3Interest payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations (c)467.6 112.0 198.3 101.6 55.7Operating lease obligations (d)685.5 181.8 263.5 140.1 100.1Other: Purchase obligations (e)916.4 867.4 48.1 0.4 0.5Other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company’s balance sheet under GAAP (f)3,939.8 — 912.8 605.9 2,421.1Total$9,482.7 $1,233.1 $2,830.7 $2,108.2 $3,310.7 (a) As described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(b) Amounts do not include interest payments. Interest on long-term debt and capital lease obligations is reflected in a separate line in the table.(c) Interest payments on long-term debt are projected for future periods using the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2014. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates.(d) As described in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain leases require the Company to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises. These future costs are not included in the schedule above.(e) Consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction.(f) Primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies and allowances, performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs, self-insurance and litigation claims, post-retirement benefits, pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities (excluding unrecognized tax benefits) and deferred compensation obligations. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management’s estimates over the terms of these arrangements and is largely based upon historical experience.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of off-balance sheet commitments of the Company as of December 31, 2014. Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period($ in millions)Total Less ThanOne Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than5 YearsGuarantees$432.9 $319.8 $62.9 $21.8 $28.4Guarantees consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit, bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds. These guarantees have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors, customers, financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure the Company’s obligations and/or performance requirements related to specific transactions.Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters or tax matters. The Company has not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they relate to unknown conditions and the Company cannot estimate the potential liabilities from such matters, but the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. In addition, as a result of these divestitures, as well as restructuring activities, certain properties leased by the Company have been sublet to third parties. In the event any of these third parties vacate any of these premises, the 55Table of ContentsCompany would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by such sub-lessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the Company’s financial statements.In the normal course of business, the Company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers, suppliers or other business partners for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the Company’s products or services or claims alleging that Company products, services or software infringe third party intellectual property. The Company has not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual obligations table above. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations.The Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the Company, or by reason of serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to limited exceptions. Danaher’s Amended and Restated By-laws provide for similar indemnification rights. In addition, Danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of Danaher Corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which Danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding. While the Company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage.Legal ProceedingsPlease refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies, and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESManagement’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience, the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments.The Company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to Note 1 in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.Accounts Receivable: The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect probable credit losses inherent in its portfolio of receivables. Determination of the allowances requires management to exercise judgment about the timing, frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the allowances for doubtful accounts and, therefore, net income. The allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s best estimate of the credit losses expected from the Company’s trade accounts, contract and finance receivable portfolios. The level of the allowances is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors including historical loss experience by receivable type, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic conditions and credit risk quality. The Company regularly performs detailed reviews of its accounts receivable portfolio to determine if an impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowances. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate with a severity, frequency and/or timing different from the Company's assumptions, additional allowances would be required and the Company’s financial statements would be adversely impacted.Inventories: The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market value. The Company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions of future demand and related pricing. Estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand, technological advances and pricing competition in many of the Company’s markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the Company’s control. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, the Company could be required to reduce the value of its inventory, which would adversely impact the Company’s financial statements.56Table of ContentsAcquired Intangibles: The Company’s business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill, in-process research and development and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the Company may incur. Refer to Notes 1, 2 and 6 in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for a description of the Company’s policies relating to goodwill, acquired intangibles and acquisitions.In performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market based approach. The Company estimates fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the Company’s reporting units, in addition to recent market available sale transactions of comparable businesses. In evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach, management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected. In certain circumstances the Company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (i.e., an income approach) in order to validate the results of the market approach. The discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had twenty-two reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment. Management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units decreases as these businesses are integrated into the Company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth. The carrying value of the goodwill included in each individual reporting unit ranges from $7 million to $4.3 billion. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2014 indicated that in all instances, the fair values of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 10% to approximately 1140%. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this hypothetical 10% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 2% to approximately 1015%. The Company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company also tests intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. These analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues, expenses, market conditions and discount rates related to these assets.If actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the Company’s financial statements.Contingent Liabilities: As discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors, including those discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If the reserves established by the Company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s financial statements.Revenue Recognition: The Company derives revenues from the sale of products and services. Refer to Note 1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s revenue recognition policies. 57Table of ContentsAlthough most of the Company’s sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, certain agreements contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. As a result, judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if so, how the consideration should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. The Company allocates revenue to each element in the contractual arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy that, in some instances, may require the Company to estimate the selling price of certain deliverables that are not sold separately or where third party evidence of pricing is not observable. The Company’s estimate of selling price impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements. The Company also enters into lease arrangements with customers, which requires the Company to determine whether the arrangements are operating or sales-type leases. Certain of the Company’s lease contracts are customized for larger customers and often result in complex terms and conditions that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criteria.If the Company's judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect, the Company's revenues in particular periods may be adversely affected. Stock-Based Compensation: For a description of the Company’s stock-based compensation accounting practices, refer to Note 17 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards require subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the awards, stock price volatility and expected forfeiture rate. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent the Company’s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. If actual results are not consistent with management’s assumptions and estimates, the Company’s equity-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefits: For a description of the Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefit accounting practices, refer to Notes 10 and 11 in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Calculations of the amount of pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations, including assumptions regarding discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rates of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. If the assumptions used in calculating pension and other post-retirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change (as a result of differences in actual experience, changes in key economic indicators or other factors) the Company’s financial statements could be materially affected. A 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the U.S. net obligation by $150 million ($94 million on an after tax basis) and the non-U.S. net obligation by $138 million ($107 million on an after tax basis) from the amounts recorded in the financial statements as of December 31, 2014.For 2014, the estimated long-term rate of return for the U.S. plan is 7.5%, and the Company intends to use an assumption of 7.5% for 2015. This expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected long-term returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets. The U.S. plan targets to invest between 60% and 70% of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments. The balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in bond funds. The Company’s non-U.S. plan assets consist of various insurance contracts, equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan. The estimated long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 1.25% to 7.10%. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2014 was reduced by 50 basis points, pension expense for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans for 2014 would have increased $10 million ($6 million on an after-tax basis) and $4 million ($3 million on an after-tax basis), respectively. For a discussion of the Company’s 2014 and anticipated 2015 defined benefit pension plan contributions, please see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash and Cash Requirements”.Income Taxes: For a description of the Company's income tax accounting policies, refer to Notes 1 and 12 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized which requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding: (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. Future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial statements. The Company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when, based upon the technical merits, it is “more-likely-than-not” that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. Judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions. The Company re-evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances, including when: (i) a tax audit is completed; (ii) applicable tax laws change, including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (iii) the applicable statute of limitations expires.58Table of ContentsIn addition, certain of the Company's tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in Denmark (see “—Results of Operations – Income Taxes"" and Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws. However, the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in the Company being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact to the Company's financial statements, including its effective tax rate.An increase in the Company's nominal tax rate of 1.0% would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 of $35 million.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which impacts virtually all aspects of an entity's revenue recognition. The core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Management has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of the new standard, including possible transition alternatives, on the Company's financial statements. ITEM 7A.

313616,DHR,DANAHER CORP /DE/,2016,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion 13and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For a discussion of risks related to our non-U.S. operations and foreign currency exchange, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”Major CustomersNo customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated sales in 2015, 2014 or 2013.Available InformationWe maintain an internet website at www.danaher.com. We make available free of charge on the website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material with, or furnishing such material to, the SEC. Our Internet site and the information contained on or connected to that site are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, economic conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.We are pursuing a plan to separate into two independent publicly traded companies. The proposed separation may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits.We have announced a plan to separate into two independent public companies in the third quarter of 2016 through a spin-off of certain of our businesses. Unanticipated developments, including possible delays in obtaining various tax rulings, regulatory approvals or clearances and trade qualifications, uncertainty of the financial markets and challenges in establishing infrastructure or processes, could delay or prevent the proposed separation or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable and/or different than expected. Even if the transaction is completed, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the spin-off. Expenses incurred to accomplish the proposed separation may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate. Executing the proposed separation also requires significant time and attention from management, which could distract them from other tasks in operating our business. Following the proposed separation, the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companies may not be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred.Conditions in the global economy, the markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our business is sensitive to general economic conditions. Slower global economic growth, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt, volatility in the currency and credit markets, high levels of unemployment or underemployment, reduced levels of capital expenditures, changes in government fiscal and monetary policies, changes in capital requirements for financial institutions, government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics, sequestration, austerity measures and other challenges that affect the global economy adversely affect the Company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, including having the effect of:•reducing demand for our products (in this Item 1A, references to products also includes software) and services, limiting the financing available to our customers and suppliers, increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies;•increasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories;•increasing price competition in our served markets; •supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; 14•increasing the risk of impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, and the risk that we may not be able to fully recover the value of other assets such as real estate and tax assets; and•increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which, in addition to increasing the risks identified above, could result in preference actions against us.Although we have been able to continue accessing the commercial paper and other capital markets through the date of this report, there can be no assurances that such markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations.If growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period, if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy don't benefit the markets we serve, our business and financial statements could be adversely affected.Our restructuring actions could have long-term adverse effects on our business.In recent years, we have implemented multiple, significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. These restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities (including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses) reduce our available talent, assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases. In addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize from such actions. Any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements.Our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve, and visibility into our markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers' capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies, and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities. Demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in incentive programs, new product introductions and customer inventory levels. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period.We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share. Even if we compete effectively, we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services.Our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. Because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors; please see “Item 1. Business - Competition” for additional details. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets, including high-growth markets. Our failure to compete effectively and/or pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements, and our expansion into new markets may result in greater-than-expected risks, liabilities and expenses.15Our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation.We generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis, our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer. Our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to:•correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;•allocate our research and development funding to products and services with higher growth prospects;•anticipate and respond to our competitors' development of new products and services and technological innovations;•differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings and avoid commoditization;•innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets;•obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies before our competitors do;•successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time;•obtain necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope, including with respect to medical device products by demonstrating satisfactory clinical results where applicable; and•stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies.In addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. In addition, promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement.Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements.Any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price.Our ability to grow revenues, earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies. We may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price. Promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including high valuations, competition among prospective buyers, the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms. In addition, competition for 16acquisitions may result in higher purchase prices. Changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions.Our acquisition of businesses (including our recent acquisition of Pall), joint ventures and strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements.As part of our business strategy we acquire businesses and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course, some of which may be material; please see “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) for additional details. In particular, as of the date of this report the acquisition of Pall in 2015 is Danaher’s largest acquisition and has expanded Danaher’s business into new markets. Acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our financial statements:•any acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it, or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable.•we may incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic relationships.•acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic relationships could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in any given period, or over the long-term.•pre-closing and post-closing earnings charges could adversely impact operating results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period to period.•acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic relationships could create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address.•we could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other controls and systems and retaining key employees and customers.•we may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition, joint venture or strategic relationship.•we may assume by acquisition, joint venture or strategic relationship unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company's activities. The realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations.•in connection with acquisitions and joint ventures, we often enter into post-closing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments, earn-out obligations and indemnification obligations, which may have unpredictable financial results.•as a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet. If we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets.•we may have interests that diverge from those of our joint venture partners or other strategic partners and we may not be able to direct the management and operations of the joint venture or other strategic relationship in the manner we believe is most appropriate, exposing us to additional risk. The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements.17Divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements.We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest, spin-off, split-off or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. These transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business. For example, when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not become satisfied. In addition, divestitures or other dispositions may dilute the Company's earnings per share, have other adverse financial and accounting impacts and distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. In addition, we have retained responsibility for and/or have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold or disposed. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.Certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. FDA and by comparable agencies of other countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information. Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements.Certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the U.S. FDA, by comparable agencies of other countries and regions and by regulations governing radioactive or other hazardous materials (or the manufacture and sale of products containing such materials). We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approvals (such as 510(k) clearance) for our new products or modifications to (or additional indications or uses of) existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be time-consuming, costly and subject to restrictions. Our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors, for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results, and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained. Failure to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products (or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products), other violations of these regulations, real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products (even after obtaining clearance for distribution) and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to FDA Form 483 Inspectional Observations, warning letters, notices to customers, declining sales, loss of customers, loss of market share, recalls, seizures of adulterated or misbranded products, injunctions, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, narrowing of permitted uses for a product, suspension or withdrawal of approvals and pre-market notification rescissions. We are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse, pricing and sales and marketing practices in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information, including the federal regulations described in “Item 1. Business - Regulatory Matters.” Many states and foreign countries have also adopted laws and regulations similar to, and in some cases more stringent than, such federal regulations. For more information regarding regulations we are subject to please see “Item 1. Business - Regulatory Matters.”Failure to comply with the regulations described above could result in the adverse effects referenced below under “Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation.” Compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses.The health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, which could adversely affect our financial statements.The health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, including the following:•many of our customers, and the end-users to whom our customers supply products, rely on government funding of and reimbursement for health care products and services and research activities. The U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “PPACA”), health care austerity measures in other countries and other potential health care reform changes and government austerity measures may reduce the amount of government funding or reimbursement available to customers or end-users of our products and services and/or the volume of medical procedures using our products and services. Global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement.18•governmental and private health care providers and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the delivery of health care services, forming group purchasing organizations to improve their purchasing leverage and using competitive bid processes to procure health care products and services.These changes as well as other impacts from market demand, government regulations, third party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures have increased our tax liabilities and may cause participants in the health care industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services, reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products and services from governmental agencies or third-party payors, reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services and increase our compliance and other costs. In addition, we may be unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us, and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability. All of the factors described above could adversely affect our financial statements.Our operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements.Our operations, products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use, generation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the United States and abroad in connection with our operations. We cannot assure you that our environmental, health and safety compliance program has been or will at all times be effective. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements.In addition, we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. We may also become subject to additional remedial, compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules. For additional information regarding these risks, please refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. However, based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2015 will have a material effect on our financial statements.Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation.In addition to the environmental, health, safety, health care, medical device, anticorruption and other regulations noted above, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional levels, including the following:•we are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons and dealings between our employees and between our subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory.•we also have agreements to sell products and services to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with government entities. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. Our agreements with government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification at the convenience of the government or in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors, and we may underestimate our costs of performing under the contract. In certain cases, a governmental entity may require us to pay back amounts it 19has paid to us. Government contracts that have been awarded to us following a bid process could become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder, which could result in loss of the contract. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts. These are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. The regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. We, our representatives and the industries in which we operate may at times be under review and/or investigation by regulatory authorities. Failure to comply (or any alleged or perceived failure to comply) with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and any such failure or alleged failure (or becoming subject to a regulatory enforcement investigation) could also damage our reputation, disrupt our business, limit our ability to manufacture, import, export and sell products and services, result in loss of customers and disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. Compliance with these and other regulations may also affect our returns on investment, require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our business. Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the International Standards Organization, and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our financial statements. For additional information regarding these risks, please refer to “Item 1. Business - Regulatory Matters.”We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.As of December 31, 2015, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $36.3 billion. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets, changes in the structure of our business, divestitures, market capitalization declines, or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized.Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements.Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products and services we purchase overseas. Sales and expenses of our non-U.S. businesses are also translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects. In addition, certain of our businesses may invoice customers in a currency other than the business' functional currency, and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable translation effects. The Company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries.Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Please see the MD&A for a discussion of the factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period. The impact of these factors may be substantially different from period to period. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities, such as the audits described in the MD&A and the Company's financial statements. Due to the potential for changes to tax laws (or changes to the interpretation thereof) and the ambiguity of tax laws, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our intercompany arrangements and other factors, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. If these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected. If we determine to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have been considered permanently re-invested under existing accounting standards, it could also increase our effective tax rate. In addition, any significant change to the tax system in the U.S. or in other jurisdictions, including changes in the taxation of international income, could adversely affect our financial statements.20We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements.We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiture-related matters, as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement. We may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, divested businesses. These lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. In addition, developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. We cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation. However, based on our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2015 will have a material effect on our financial statements.If we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our business. The intellectual property rights that we obtain, however, may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. In addition, the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented, designed-around or becoming subject to compulsory licensing, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons, or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements.Third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.From time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. Any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to critical technology, be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services, be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements. Even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our financial statements.21Defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products (including software) or services could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.Manufacturing or design defects or ""bugs"" in, unanticipated use of, safety or quality issues (or the perception of such issues) with respect to, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell (including items that we source from third parties) can lead to personal injury, death, property damage or other liability. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts, result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us. Recalls, removals and product liability and similar claims (regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome) can result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services.The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products, our reputation, business and financial statements could suffer.The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters and environmental factors, and if not discovered before the product is released to market could result in recalls and product liability exposure. Because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities, an alternative manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity. Any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant costs and liability, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products.Our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow, and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements.As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $12.9 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we had the ability to incur approximately an additional $2.0 billion of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under our $6.0 billion of credit facilities which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2015. Our debt level and related debt service obligations can have negative consequences, including (1) requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and capital investment; (2) reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and (3) exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. We may incur significantly more debt in the future, particularly to finance acquisitions, and there can be no assurance that our cost of funding will not substantially increase.Our current revolving credit facilities and long-term debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us; for more information please refer to the MD&A. If we breach any of these restrictions and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements. In addition, any failure to maintain the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies would adversely affect our cost of funds and could adversely affect our liquidity and access to the capital markets. If we add new debt, the risks described above could increase.Adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition, performance, purchasing patterns or inventory levels of, key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements.Certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and end-users. Some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors' products or compete with us directly, and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. Adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners, or adverse developments in their financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns, could adversely affect our financial statements. The levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners, and changes in those levels, can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period. In addition, the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries could adversely impact our profitability.Our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations.As discussed in “Item 1. Business - Materials,” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components, raw materials and other commodities. Prices for and availability of these components, raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past. Any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our 22business. In addition, due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve, the cost-containment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to, if commodity prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions, or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs, we could experience lower margins and profitability and our financial statements could be adversely affected.If we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand, our profitability may suffer. In addition, our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials, components and services could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies.We purchase materials, components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations. Our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations, including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality. During a market upturn, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices. If we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand, we may not be able to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed, our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities. Conversely, in order to secure supplies for the production of products, we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer.In addition, some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. If these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, war, terrorist actions, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes. Any of these factors could result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies.Because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements. Any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our profitability.Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses.We compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional regulations, such as regulations governing health and safety, the environment, food and drugs, privacy and electronic communications. We develop, configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. Any significant change in any of these regulations (or in the interpretation or application thereof) could reduce demand for, increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services, or could restrict our existing activities, products and services. In addition, in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations. In these markets, the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations, or the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address, could adversely affect demand. In addition, regulatory deadlines may result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period to period.Work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations.We have a number of U.S. collective bargaining units and various non-U.S. collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our productivity, results of operations and reputation.23International economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements.In 2015, approximately 56% of our sales were derived from customers outside the U.S. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located outside the U.S. Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the U.S. and increase the localization of our products and services, we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the U.S., particularly in the high-growth markets. Our international business (and particularly our business in high-growth markets) is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations, including:•interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers; •differences in terms of sale, including payment terms;•local product preferences and product requirements;•changes in a country's or region's political or economic conditions, such as the devaluation of particular currencies;•trade protection measures, embargoes and import or export restrictions and requirements;•unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including negative changes in tax laws;•limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash;•the potential for nationalization of enterprises;•changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs;•limitations on legal rights and our ability to enforce such rights;•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;•differing labor regulations;•difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis; and•differing protection of intellectual property.Any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and growth.If we suffer loss to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed.Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, public health crisis, war, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. If any of these facilities, supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses. The third-party insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses.A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. These systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. In addition, security breaches of our systems (or the systems of our customers, suppliers or other business partners) could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers. Like many multinational corporations, our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent. Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations, delay production 24and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements.The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets, investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements. In addition, upward pressure on the cost of providing health care coverage to current employees and retirees may increase our future funding obligations and adversely affect our financial statements.ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNot applicable.ITEM 2. PROPERTIESOur corporate headquarters are located in Washington, D.C. in a facility that we lease. As of December 31, 2015, we had facilities in over 50 countries, including approximately 336 significant manufacturing and distribution facilities. 160 of these facilities are located in the United States in over 25 states and 176 are located outside the United States in over 30 other countries, primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia, the rest of North America, South America and Australia. These facilities cover approximately 30 million square feet, of which approximately 18 million square feet are owned and approximately 12 million square feet are leased. Particularly outside the United States, facilities often serve more than one business segment and may be used for multiple purposes, such as administration, sales, manufacturing, warehousing and/or distribution. The number of significant facilities by business segment is:•Test & Measurement, 38;•Environmental, 46;•Life Sciences & Diagnostics, 143;•Dental, 48; and•Industrial Technologies, 61.We consider our facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used and do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. We believe our properties and equipment have been well-maintained. Please refer to Note 15 in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information with respect to our lease commitments.ITEM 3.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide a reader of Danaher’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of Company management. The Company’s MD&A is divided into five sections:•Overview•Results of Operations•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Critical Accounting Estimates•New Accounting StandardsOVERVIEWGeneralPlease see “Item 1. Business – General” for a discussion of Danaher’s objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value. Danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations. During 2015, approximately 56% of Danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the United States. As a diversified, global business, Danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors. Danaher’s geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of its products and services, typically help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results. Given the broad range of products manufactured, software and services provided and geographies served, management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the Company. The Company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.As a result of the Company’s geographic and industry diversity, the Company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges, including rapid technological development (particularly with respect to computing, mobile connectivity, communications and digitization) in most of the Company’s served markets, the expansion and evolution of opportunities in high-growth markets, trends and costs associated with a global labor force, consolidation of the Company’s competitors and increasing regulation. The Company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and the Company’s long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in high-growth geographies and high-growth market segments, identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative and differentiated new products, services and software with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of the Company’s sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment. The Company is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources (particularly in high-growth markets) in order to be responsive to the Company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the Company’s operations. Business Performance and OutlookWhile differences exist among the Company’s businesses, on an overall basis, demand for the Company’s products, software and services increased in 2015 as compared to 2014 resulting in aggregate year-over-year sales growth from existing businesses of 3.0%. The Company’s continued investments in sales growth initiatives and the other business-specific factors discussed below also contributed to year-over-year sales growth. Geographically, both high-growth and developed markets contributed to year-over-year sales growth from existing businesses during 2015. Sales growth rates from existing businesses in high-growth markets grew at a mid-single digit rate in 2015 as compared to 2014 led by strength in China and India, partially offset by weakness in Russia and Latin America. High-growth markets represented approximately 27% of the Company’s total sales in 2015. Sales from existing businesses in developed markets grew at a low-single digit rate in 2015 as compared to 2014 and were driven by North America and Western Europe. While individual business results will vary, the Company expects sales from existing businesses to continue to grow on a year-over-year basis during 2016 at a level in line with the growth levels experienced in 2015 but remains cautious about challenges due to macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainties, including global uncertainties related to monetary and fiscal policies.The acquisition of Pall, as further discussed below, provides additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Company’s Life Sciences and Diagnostics segment by expanding the segment’s geographic and product line diversity, 29Table of Contentsincluding new and complementary product and service offerings in the area of filtration, separation and purification technologies, and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses. As Pall is integrated into the Company, the Company also expects to realize significant cost synergies through the application of the Danaher Business System and the combined purchasing power of the Company and Pall.Danaher SeparationOn May 13, 2015, the Company announced its intention to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies (the “Separation”). Completion of the Separation will create:•a multi-industry, science and technology growth company that will retain the Danaher name and consist of Danaher’s existing Life Sciences & Diagnostics (including Pall) and Dental segments and water quality as well as the product identification businesses, which in aggregate generated approximately $16.5 billion of revenue in 2015 (adjusted to include the full annual revenues of Pall for 2015); and•a diversified industrial growth company (Fortive Corporation (“Fortive”)) that will consist of Danaher’s existing Test & Measurement segment, Industrial Technologies segment (excluding the product identification businesses) and retail/commercial petroleum business, which in aggregate generated approximately $6.0 billion of revenue in 2015.The transaction is expected to occur through a tax-free separation. The Company is targeting to complete the Separation in the third quarter of 2016, subject to final approval by Danaher’s Board of Directors and other customary conditions. The Separation will be in the form of a pro rata distribution to Danaher shareholders of 100% of the outstanding shares of Fortive.AcquisitionsOn August 31, 2015, Pentagon Merger Sub, Inc., a New York corporation and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pall, a New York corporation, for $127.20 per share in cash, for a total purchase price of approximately $13.6 billion, net of assumed debt of $417 million and acquired cash of approximately $1.2 billion (the “Pall Acquisition”). Pall is a leading global provider of filtration, separation and purification solutions that remove contaminants or separate substances from a variety of solids, liquids and gases, and is now part of the Company’s Life Sciences & Diagnostics segment. In its fiscal year ended July 31, 2015, Pall generated consolidated revenues of approximately $2.8 billion. Pall serves customers in the biopharmaceutical, food and beverage and medical markets as well as the process technologies, aerospace and microelectronics markets.The Company financed the approximately $13.6 billion acquisition price of Pall with approximately $2.5 billion of available cash, approximately $8.1 billion of net proceeds from the issuance and sale of U.S. dollar and Euro-denominated commercial paper and €2.7 billion (approximately $3.0 billion based on currency exchange rates as of the date of issuance) of net proceeds from the issuance and sale of Euro-denominated senior unsecured notes. Subsequent to the Pall Acquisition, the Company used the approximately $2.0 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes and the approximately CHF 755 million ($732 million based on currency exchange rates as of date of issuance) of net proceeds, including the related premium, from the issuance and sale of Swiss franc-denominated senior unsecured bonds to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance the Pall Acquisition.In addition to the Pall Acquisition, during 2015 the Company acquired 11 businesses for total consideration of approximately $727 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company’s five segments. The aggregate annual sales of these 11 businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $375 million.Disposition of Communications BusinessIn July 2015, the Company consummated the split-off of the majority of its Test & Measurement segment’s communications business (other than the data communications cable installation business and the communication service provider business of Fluke Networks which are now part of the instruments business of the Company’s Test & Measurement segment) to Danaher shareholders who elected to exchange Danaher shares for ownership interests in the communications business, and the subsequent merger of the communications business with a subsidiary of NetScout. Danaher shareholders who participated in the exchange offer tendered 26 million shares of Danaher common stock (valued at approximately $2.3 billion based on the closing price of Danaher’s common stock on the date of tender) and received 62.5 million shares of NetScout common stock which represented approximately 60% of the shares of NetScout common stock outstanding following the combination.The accounting requirements for reporting the disposition of the communications business as a discontinued operation were met when the separation and merger were completed. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented reflect this business as discontinued operations. The Company allocated a portion of the consolidated interest 30Table of Contentsexpense to discontinued operations based on the ratio of the discontinued business’ net assets to the Company’s consolidated net assets. The Company recorded an aggregate after-tax gain on the disposition of this business of $767 million, or $1.08 per diluted share, in its 2015 results in connection with the closing of this transaction representing the value of the 26 million shares of Company common stock tendered for the communications business in excess of the carrying value of the business’ net assets. This gain was included in the results of discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 and included $47 million of charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 resulting from the reconciliation of deferred income tax balances used in calculating the gain recorded in the third quarter of 2015. The communications business had revenues of $346 million in 2015 prior to the disposition and $760 million in 2014.For a discussion of the Company’s 2014 and 2013 acquisition and divestiture activity, refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Investing Activities”.Sale of InvestmentsDuring 2015, the Company received cash proceeds of $43 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and recorded a pretax gain related to these sales of $12 million ($8 million after-tax or $0.01 per diluted share).For a discussion of the Company’s 2014 and 2013 sale of investments activity, refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Investing Activities”.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSConsolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased 7.5% compared to 2014. Sales from existing businesses contributed 3.0% growth and sales from acquired businesses contributed 10.5% growth on a year-over-year basis. The impact of currency translation reduced reported sales by 6.0% as the U.S. dollar was, on average, stronger against other major currencies during 2015 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2014.Consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased 5.0% compared to 2013. Sales from existing businesses contributed 4.0% growth and sales from acquired businesses contributed 1.5% growth on a year-over-year basis. The impact of currency translation reduced reported sales by 0.5% as the U.S. dollar was, on average, stronger against other major currencies during 2014 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2013.In this report, references to sales from existing businesses refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) but excluding (1) sales from acquired businesses and (2) the impact of currency translation. References to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to GAAP sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales and operating profit, as applicable, attributable to divested product lines not considered discontinued operations. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses) and (b) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. Sales from existing businesses should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting the non-GAAP financial measure of sales from existing businesses provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with our performance in prior and future periods and to our peers. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from sales from existing businesses because currency translation is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestiture related items because the nature, size and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period to period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. References to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales.Operating profit margins were 16.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 17.5% in 2014. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.2015 vs. 2014 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by: •Higher 2015 sales volumes from existing businesses and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2014 and 2015, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments and the effect of a stronger U.S. dollar in 2015 - 75 basis points31Table of Contents•Lower year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives - 25 basis points2015 vs. 2014 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:•Acquisition related charges associated with Pall, including transaction costs deemed significant, change in control payments, and fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue, net of the positive impact of freezing pension benefits - 65 basis points•The incremental net dilutive effect in 2015 of acquired businesses, including Pall, net of the positive effect of the product line disposition in the third quarter of 2014 - 85 basis points•Charges associated with the anticipated 2016 Separation - 10 basis pointsThe Company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant (generally relating to the Company’s larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for the Company in a given period.Operating profit margins were 17.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 17.1% in 2013.

Management believes the destocking impact will be less significant in 2016 as compared to 2015. Lower year-over-year demand for dental equipment in the Middle East due to slower project activity during 2015 also adversely impacted year-over-year performance. The acquisition of Nobel Biocare in December 2014 has provided additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Company’s Dental segment by expanding the businesses’ geographic and product line diversity, including new and complementary product and service offerings in the area of implant based tooth replacements.Operating profit margins declined 40 basis points during 2015 as compared to 2014. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.2015 vs. 2014 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:•Incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2014 and 2015, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments and the effect of a stronger U.S. dollar in 2015 - 45 basis points•Lower year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives - 10 basis points2015 vs. 2014 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:•The incremental net dilutive effect in 2015 of acquired businesses - 95 basis pointsDepreciation and amortization increased during 2015 as compared with 2014 due primarily to the impact of recently acquired businesses, primarily Nobel Biocare.2014 Compared to 2013 Price increases in the segment contributed 0.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2014 as compared with 2013 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.Sales from existing businesses grew on a year-over-year basis as a result of increased demand for all major product categories, with strong sales of imaging products, instruments and implant products, along with modest growth in dental consumables. Geographically, year-over-year sales grew in Europe and high-growth markets, specifically China and the Middle East. Operating profit margins declined 70 basis points during 2014 as compared to 2013.

Geographically, year-over-year sales growth was led by North America and Europe (although North America declined slightly in the fourth quarter of 2015), but was partly offset by softer demand for the business’ packaging and color solutions in Brazil and Russia.Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s automation business increased slightly during 2015 as compared to 2014. A strong increase in year-over-year demand in technology and defense related end-markets in North America and distribution-related end markets in Europe, was largely offset by lower demand in North American distribution and industrial automation related end-markets as well as agricultural-related end markets in North America and Europe. During the third quarter of 2014, the Company sold its electric vehicle systems (“EVS”)/hybrid product line. The impact of this divestiture is reflected in “Acquisitions (divestitures), net” in the Components of Sales Growth table above as the disposition was not deemed a 40Table of Contentsdiscontinued operation for financial reporting purposes. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to this transaction. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s other businesses collectively declined at a low-single digit rate during 2015 as compared with 2014. Sales in the segment’s energetic materials and sensors and controls businesses declined on a year-over-year basis, while sales in the segment’s engine retarder business were essentially flat on a year-over-year basis.Operating profit margins increased 140 basis points during 2015 as compared to 2014.

Continued increased demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables as well as packaging and color solutions was partially offset by continued lower year-over-year demand in consumer electronics-related equipment. Geographically, year-over-year sales growth was led by North America and Europe.Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s automation business grew at a low-single digit rate during 2014 as compared to 2013. Improved year-over-year demand in industrial automation, in North America distribution and in medical related end-markets was partially offset by lower year-over-year demand in technology, agricultural and defense-related end-markets and the effect of exiting certain low-margin original equipment manufacturer product lines which negatively impacted the first half of 2014. Geographically, strong year-over-year demand in China and other high-growth markets as well as moderate sales growth in North America, more than offset year-over-year sales declines in Europe. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s other businesses collectively grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to strong demand in the segment’s engine retarder business, and to a lesser extent, continued improving demand in the segment’s sensors and controls businesses.Operating profit margins increased 160 basis points during 2014 as compared to 2013.

These factors were partially offset by lower year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2014 and 2015.The year-over-year increase in cost of sales during 2014 as compared with 2013, is due primarily to the impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory in connection with the acquisition of Nobel Biocare during the fourth quarter of 2014 and incremental year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives, partially offset by incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2013 and 2014.Gross profit margins increased 70 basis points on a year-over-year basis during 2015 as compared with 2014, due primarily to the favorable impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, higher gross profit margins of recently acquired businesses and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2014 and 2015. These positive factors more than offset the 2015 acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue in connection with the acquisition of Pall and Nobel Biocare during the third quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2014, respectively, which adversely impacted gross profit margins comparisons by 30 basis points during 2015 as compared with 2014.Gross profit margins increased 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis during 2014 as compared with 2013, due primarily to the favorable impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2013 and 2014, partially offset by acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory in connection with the acquisition of Nobel Biocare during the fourth quarter of 2014 and incremental year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives.OPERATING EXPENSES For the Year Ended December 31($ in millions)2015 2014 2013Sales$20,563.1 $19,154.0 $18,283.1Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses6,054.3 5,389.0 5,117.1Research and development (“R&D”) expenses1,239.1 1,157.0 1,104.4SG&A as a % of sales29.4% 28.1% 28.0%R&D as a % of sales6.0% 6.0% 6.0%Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased 130 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2015 compared with 2014. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales from 2014 to 2015 was driven by continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives and higher relative spending levels at recently acquired businesses. In addition, costs incurred in connection with the Separation adversely impacted year-over-year comparisons by 10 basis points. Change in control payments to Pall employees in connection with the Pall Acquisition, as well as associated transaction costs and amortization charges associated with acquisition-related intangible assets, net of the positive impact of freezing pension benefits, adversely impacted selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by 20 basis points during 2015. These increases were partially offset by the benefit of increased leverage of the Company’s 42Table of Contentsgeneral and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2015 sales, lower year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2014 and 2015.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2014 compared with 2013. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales from 2013 to 2014 reflects incremental year-over-year investments in the Company’s sales and marketing growth initiatives, higher corporate expenses and incremental year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives. In addition, transaction costs incurred in connection with the closing of the Nobel Biocare acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2014 unfavorably impacted the year-over-year comparison by approximately five basis points. These increases were partially offset by the benefit of increased leverage of the Company’s general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2014 sales and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with 2013 and 2014 restructuring actions.Research and development expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) as a percentage of sales remained flat in 2015 as compared with 2014 and 2013.OTHER INCOME During 2015, the Company received cash proceeds of $43 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and recorded a pretax gain related to these sales of $12 million ($8 million after-tax or $0.01 per diluted share).During 2014, the Company received cash proceeds of $167 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and recorded a pretax gain related to these sales of $123 million ($77 million after-tax or $0.11 per diluted share). In addition, the Company completed the divestiture of its EVS/hybrid product line for a sale price of $87 million in cash in August 2014. This product line, which was part of the Industrial Technologies segment, had revenues of approximately $60 million in 2014 prior to the divestiture and approximately $100 million in 2013. Operating results of the product line were not significant to segment or overall Company reported results. The Company recorded a pretax gain on the sale of the product line of $34 million ($26 million after-tax or $0.04 per diluted share) in its third quarter 2014 results. Subsequent to the sale, the Company has no continuing involvement in the EVS/hybrid product line. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company sold 5 million of the 8 million shares of Align Technology, Inc. (“Align”) common stock that the Company received in 2009 as a result of a settlement between Align and Ormco Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company received cash proceeds of $251 million from the sale of these marketable equity securities and recorded a pretax gain of $202 million ($125 million after-tax or $0.18 per diluted share).On July 4, 2010, the Company entered into a joint venture with Cooper Industries, plc (“Cooper”), combining certain of the Company’s hand tool businesses with Cooper’s Tools business to form a new entity, Apex Tool Group, LLC (“Apex”). Each of Cooper and the Company had owned a 50% interest in Apex, had an equal number of representatives on Apex’s Board of Directors and neither joint venture partner controlled the significant operating and financing activities of Apex. The Company had accounted for its investment in the joint venture based on the equity method of accounting.In February 2013, the Company and Cooper sold Apex to an unrelated third party for approximately $1.6 billion. The Company received $797 million from the sale, consisting of cash of $759 million (including $67 million of dividends received prior to closing) and a note receivable of $38 million (which has been subsequently collected). The Company recognized a pretax gain of $230 million ($144 million after-tax or $0.20 per diluted share) in its first quarter 2013 results in connection with this transaction. The Company’s share of the 2013 earnings generated by Apex prior to the closing of the sale was insignificant. Subsequent to the sale of its investment in Apex, the Company has no continuing involvement in Apex’s operations.INTEREST COSTSInterest expense of $163 million for 2015 was $44 million higher than in 2014, due primarily to the higher interest costs associated with the debt issued in connection with the Pall Acquisition. For a further description of the Company’s debt as of December 31, 2015 see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest expense of $119 million in 2014 was $22 million lower than the 2013 interest expense of $141 million due primarily to the repayment of the $400 million principal amount of 1.3% senior unsecured notes due 2014 upon maturity in June 2014 in addition to the repayment of the €500 million principal amount of Eurobond notes due 2013 and the $300 million principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2013 upon maturity in July and June 2013, respectively.43Table of ContentsINCOME TAXESGeneralIncome tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the Company’s financial statements. The Company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.The Company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws, including legislative policy changes that may result from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s initiative on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. For a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, refer to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash and Cash Requirements” below.The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis. Based on these reviews, the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities, tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations, reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary. For a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.Year-Over-Year Changes in the Tax Provision and Effective Tax RateThe Company’s effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was 21.8%, 25.2% and 24.2%, respectively.The Company’s effective tax rate for each of 2015, 2014 and 2013 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35.0% due principally to the Company’s earnings outside the United States that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate. The effective tax rate of 21.8% in 2015 includes net tax benefits from foreign exchange losses, releases of valuation allowances related to foreign operating losses and the release of reserves upon the expiration of statutes of limitation, partially offset by changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions and other matters. The effective tax rate of 25.2% in 2014 includes tax expense for audit settlements in various jurisdictions, partially offset by the release of valuation allowances and the release of reserves upon the expiration of statutes of limitation. The effective tax rate of 24.2% in 2013 includes recognition of tax benefits associated with favorable resolutions of certain international and domestic uncertain tax positions and the lapse of certain statutes of limitations, partially offset by adjustments of reserve estimates related to prior period uncertain tax positions. The matters referenced above have been treated as discrete items in the periods they occurred and in the aggregate reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately 140 and 20 basis points in 2015 and 2013, respectively, and increased the provision for income taxes by approximately 170 basis points in 2014.The Company conducts business globally, and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the United States federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. The countries in which the Company has a significant presence that have significantly lower statutory tax rates than the United States include China, Denmark, Germany, Singapore, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The Company’s ability to obtain a tax benefit from lower statutory tax rates outside of the United States is dependent on its levels of taxable income in these foreign countries and the amount of foreign earnings which are indefinitely reinvested in those countries. The Company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements given the geographic dispersion of the Company’s taxable income.The Company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed examinations of certain of the Company’s federal income tax returns through 2009 and is currently examining certain of the Company’s federal income tax returns for 2010 through 2013. In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, the United Kingdom and various other countries, states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2003 through 2014.Tax authorities in Denmark have raised significant issues related to interest accrued by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. On December 10, 2013, the Company received assessments from the Danish tax authority (“SKAT”) totaling approximately DKK 1.2 billion (approximately $180 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2015) including interest through December 31, 2015, imposing withholding tax relating to interest accrued in Denmark on borrowings from certain of the 44Table of ContentsCompany’s subsidiaries for the years 2004-2009. If the SKAT claims are successful, it is likely that the Company would be assessed additional amounts for years 2010-2012 totaling approximately DKK 700 million (approximately $102 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2015). Management believes the positions the Company has taken in Denmark are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and intends to vigorously defend its positions. The Company appealed these assessments with the National Tax Tribunal in 2014 and intends on pursuing this matter through the European Court of Justice should this appeal be unsuccessful. The ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, could take many years, and could result in a material adverse impact to the Company’s financial statements, including its effective tax rate.As previously disclosed, German tax authorities had raised issues related to the deductibility and taxability of interest accrued by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the German tax authorities to resolve these open matters through 2014. The Company recorded €49 million (approximately $60 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2014) of expense for taxes and interest related to this settlement during the fourth quarter of 2014. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to be approximately 23% to 24%. This anticipated rate reflects the benefit from the research and experimentation credit in the United States which was permanently extended in 2015.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS As further discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, discontinued operations includes the results of the Company’s Test & Measurement segment’s communications business (other than the data communications cable installation business and the communication service provider business of Fluke Networks which are now part of the instruments business of the Company’s Test & Measurement segment) which was disposed of during the third quarter of 2015. All periods presented have been restated to reflect the communications business within discontinued operations. In 2015, earnings from operations of discontinued business, net of tax, were $759 million and reflected the operating results of the communications business as well as the gain on the sale of the communications business. In 2014 and 2013, earnings from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax, were $55 million and $104 million, respectively and reflected the operations of the communications business.COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEComprehensive income increased by approximately $1.5 billion in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to the impact of increases in net earnings, foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to most major currencies during the year but at a lower rate than in the prior year, and pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments. The Company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of approximately $1.0 billion for 2015 compared to a translation loss of approximately $1.2 billion for 2014. The Company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit gain of $81 million for 2015 compared to a loss of $361 million for 2014.Comprehensive income decreased by approximately $2.0 billion in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to most major currencies during the year, in addition to the impact from pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments. The Company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of approximately $1.2 billion for 2014 compared to a translation loss of $62 million for 2013. Pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments resulted in a loss of $361 million in 2014 compared to a gain of $289 million in 2013.INFLATIONThe effect of inflation on the Company’s revenues and net earnings was not significant in any of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013.45Table of ContentsFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENTThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit risk, equity prices and commodity prices, each of which could impact its financial statements. The Company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. In addition, the Company’s broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole.Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. A change in interest rates on long-term debt impacts the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt but not the Company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2015, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt (excluding the LYONs, which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from the value of its underlying common stock) by approximately $445 million.As of December 31, 2015, the Company’s variable-rate debt obligations consisted primarily of U.S. dollar and Euro-based commercial paper borrowings (refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2015). As a result, the Company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term interest rates. As these shorter duration obligations mature, the Company anticipates issuing additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. In 2015, the average annual interest rate associated with outstanding commercial paper borrowings was approximately 20 basis points. A hypothetical increase of this average to 40 basis points would have increased the Company’s interest expense by $7 million. Currency Exchange Rate RiskThe Company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than Danaher’s functional currency or the functional currency of its applicable subsidiary. The Company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign operations into U.S. dollars, Danaher’s functional currency. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the Company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2015 would have resulted in a reduction of stockholders’ equity of approximately $1.4 billion.Currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2015 reported sales by 6.0% on a year-over-year basis as the U.S. dollar was, on average, stronger against most major currencies during 2015 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2014. If the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2015 were to prevail throughout 2016, currency exchange rates would adversely impact 2016 estimated sales by approximately 1.5% relative to the Company’s performance in 2015. Additional strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would further adversely impact the Company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis. Any weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would positively impact the Company’s sales and results of operations. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales, profit, and assets and liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.On April 2, 2014, the Company terminated the Japanese Yen/U.S. dollar currency swap agreement that had been acquired in connection with a prior business acquisition. The currency swap agreement initially required the Company to purchase approximately 184 million Japanese Yen (JPY/¥) at a rate of $1/¥102.25 on a monthly basis through June 1, 2018. The currency swap did not qualify for hedge accounting, and as a result, changes in the fair value of the currency swap were reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings each reporting period. The fair value of the currency swap as of the termination date was not significant and the fair value had not 46Table of Contentschanged significantly during 2014 prior to the swap being terminated. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company recorded pretax income of $14 million related to changes in the fair value of this currency swap. Credit RiskThe Company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, receivables from customers and derivatives. The Company places cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the third party depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the Company’s customers. The Company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate.The Company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and, with the exception of the Yen swap noted above, such transactions are generally insignificant to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. These transactions are entered into only with high-quality financial institutions and exposure at any one institution is limited.Equity Price RiskThe Company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio includes publicly traded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale investments due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the equity securities. A 10% decline in the value of these equity securities as of December 31, 2015 would have reduced the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio by $34 million.Commodity Price RiskFor a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices, refer “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESManagement assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses, consummating strategic acquisitions, paying interest and servicing debt and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis.47Table of ContentsFollowing is an overview of the Company’s cash flows and liquidity for the years ended December 31:Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity($ in millions)2015 2014 2013Total operating cash flows provided by continuing operations$3,828.0 $3,618.0 $3,467.4 Cash paid for acquisitions$(14,305.0) $(3,128.4) $(882.5)Payments for additions to property, plant and equipment(633.0) (580.6) (538.1)Payments for purchases of investments(87.1) — —Proceeds from sales of investments and a product line43.0 253.8 958.6All other investing activities69.9 30.3 (2.4)Total investing cash used in discontinued operations(38.8) (19.4) (88.1)Net cash used in investing activities$(14,951.0) $(3,444.3)$(552.5) Proceeds from the issuance of common stock$249.0 $132.9 $177.4Payment of dividends(354.1) (227.7) (52.1)Net proceeds from (repayments of) borrowings (maturities of 90 days or less)3,511.2 312.2 (763.3)Proceeds from borrowings (maturities longer than 90 days)5,682.9 — —Repayments of borrowings (maturities longer than 90 days)(35.5) (414.7) (967.8)All other financing activities(3.3) (20.9) —Net cash provided by (used in) used in financing activities$9,050.2 $(218.2) $(1,605.8)•Operating cash flows from continuing operations increased $210 million, or approximately 6%, during 2015 as compared to 2014, due primarily to higher net earnings which also included higher noncash charges for depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and acquisition related costs. Lower levels of investment in working capital during 2015 compared with 2014 also contributed to the increase in operating cash flows for the year.•Cash paid for acquisitions constituted the most significant use of cash during 2015. The Company acquired 12 businesses during 2015, including the acquisition of Pall, for total consideration (including assumed debt and net of cash acquired) of approximately $14.3 billion.•The Company financed the approximately $13.6 billion acquisition price of Pall with approximately $2.5 billion of available cash, approximately $8.1 billion of net proceeds from the issuance and sale of U.S. dollar and Euro-denominated commercial paper and €2.7 billion (approximately $3.0 billion based on currency exchange rates as of the date of issuance) of net proceeds from the issuance and sale of Euro-denominated senior unsecured notes. Subsequent to the Pall Acquisition, the Company used the approximately $2.0 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes and the approximately CHF 755 million ($732 million based on currency exchange rates as of the date of issuance) of net proceeds, including the related premium from the issuance and sale of Swiss franc-denominated senior unsecured bonds, to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance a portion of the Pall Acquisition.•As of December 31, 2015, the Company held approximately $791 million of cash and cash equivalents.Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows.Operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $3.8 billion for 2015, an increase of $210 million, or approximately 6%, as compared to 2014. The year-over-year change in operating cash flows from 2014 to 2015 was primarily attributable to the following factors:•2015 operating cash flows benefited from higher net earnings as compared to 2014 excluding in both years the impact of gains included in other nonoperating income. These nonoperating gains, which include gains from sales of 48Table of Contentsinvestments, product lines and discontinued operations, are reflected in the investing activities section of the Statement of Cash Flows and, therefore, do not contribute to operating cash flows.•The aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable provided $172 million in operating cash flows during 2015, compared to $45 million provided in 2014. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively the Company manages the cash conversion cycle, which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day it pays for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from its customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period.•The aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities provided $31 million in operating cash flows during 2015, compared to $18 million used in 2014. The timing of cash payments for income taxes and various employee related liabilities, including with respect to recently acquired companies, drove the majority of this change. •Net earnings from continuing operations for 2015 reflected an increase of $162 million of depreciation and amortization expense as compared to 2014. Amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions. Depreciation expense relates to both the Company’s manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operating-type lease arrangements. Depreciation and amortization are noncash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows.Operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $3.6 billion for 2014, an increase of $151 million, or 4% as compared to 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in operating profit in 2014 as compared to 2013. Investing ActivitiesCash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures, including instruments leased to customers, cash used for investments and cash proceeds from divestitures of businesses or assets.Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $15.0 billion during 2015 compared to approximately $3.4 billion and $553 million of net cash used in 2014 and 2013, respectively.Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of Investments2015 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of InvestmentsFor a discussion of the Company’s 2015 acquisitions, divestitures and the sale of certain marketable equity securities, refer to “—Overview.”2014 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of InvestmentsIn December 2014, the Company successfully completed its tender offer for the outstanding shares of common stock of Nobel Biocare and acquired substantially all of the Nobel shares, with the remainder of the Nobel shares acquired in 2015 pursuant to a squeeze-out transaction, for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately CHF 1.9 billion (approximately $1.9 billion based on exchange rates as of the date the shares of common stock were acquired) including debt assumed and net of cash acquired. Headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, Nobel Biocare is a world leader in the field of innovative implant-based dental restorations with a portfolio of solutions that include dental implant systems, high-precision individualized prosthetics, biomaterials and digital diagnostics, treatment planning and guided surgery. Nobel Biocare had revenues of €567 million in 2013 (approximately $780 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2013), and is now part of the Company’s Dental segment. The Company financed the acquisition of Nobel Biocare from available cash.In addition to the acquisition of Nobel Biocare, during 2014 the Company acquired 16 businesses for total consideration of approximately $1.3 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of the Test & Measurement, Environmental, Life Sciences & Diagnostics and Dental segments. The aggregate annual sales of these 16 businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $420 million.In August 2014, the Company completed the divestiture of its electric vehicle systems (“EVS”)/hybrid product line for a sale price of $87 million in cash. This product line, which was part of the Industrial Technologies segment, had revenues of approximately $60 million in 2014 prior to the divestiture and approximately $100 million in 2013. Operating results of the product line were not significant to segment or overall Company reported results in 2014. The Company recorded a pretax gain 49Table of Contentson the sale of the product line of $34 million ($26 million after-tax or $0.04 per diluted share) in its third quarter 2014 results. Subsequent to the sale, the Company has no continuing involvement in the EVS/hybrid product line. In accordance with ASU No. 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, which the Company adopted at the beginning of the third quarter of 2014, the divestiture of the EVS/hybrid product line was not classified as a discontinued operation in this Form 10-K since the disposition does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial statements.During 2014, the Company received cash proceeds of $167 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and recorded a pretax gain related to these sales of $123 million ($77 million after-tax or $0.11 per diluted share).2013 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of InvestmentsDuring 2013, the Company acquired 12 businesses for total consideration of $883 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of the Industrial Technologies, Life Sciences & Diagnostics, Environmental and Test & Measurement segments. The aggregate annual sales of these 12 businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $300 million. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company sold approximately 5 million of the approximately 8 million shares of Align common stock that the Company received in 2009 as a result of a settlement between Align and Ormco. The Company received cash proceeds of $251 million from the sale of these securities and recorded a pretax gain of $202 million ($125 million after-tax or $0.18 per diluted share).On July 4, 2010, the Company entered into a joint venture with Cooper, combining certain of the Company’s hand tool businesses with Cooper’s Tools business to form a new entity, Apex. In February 2013, the Company and Cooper sold Apex to an unrelated third party for approximately $1.6 billion. The Company received $797 million from the sale, consisting of cash of $759 million (including $67 million of dividends received prior to closing) and a note receivable of $38 million (which has been subsequently collected). The Company recognized a pretax gain of $230 million ($144 million after-tax or $0.20 per diluted share) in its first quarter 2013 results in connection with this transaction.Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development, improving information technology systems and the manufacture of instruments that are used in operating-type lease arrangements that certain of the Company’s businesses enter into with customers. Capital expenditures totaled $633 million in 2015, $581 million in 2014 and $538 million in 2013. The increase in capital spending in 2015 is due to continued investments in other operating assets, including operating assets at newly acquired businesses such as Nobel Biocare and Pall, partially offset by year-over-year differences in the timing of investments in equipment leased to customers. The increase in capital spending in 2014 is due primarily to increases in equipment leased to customers. In 2016, the Company expects capital spending (including with respect to the Fortive businesses that the Company anticipates spinning-off in 2016) to be approximately $750 million, though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions.Financing ActivitiesCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper and other debt, issuances and repurchases of common stock, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and payments of cash dividends to shareholders. Financing activities provided cash of approximately $9.1 billion during 2015 compared to $218 million of cash used during 2014. Cash provided by financing activities in 2015 primarily relates to the approximately $5.0 billion of proceeds from the sale of U.S. dollar and Euro-denominated senior unsecured notes, $732 million of proceeds from the sale of Swiss franc-denominated senior unsecured bonds and approximately $5.7 billion of proceeds from the sale of U.S. dollar and Euro-denominated commercial paper, in each case related to the financing of the Pall Acquisition. U.S. and Euro-denominated commercial paper outstanding at any one time during the year ended December 31, 2015 had balances ranging from $450 million to approximately $9.8 billion, carried interest at annual rates ranging between -0.03% and 0.5% and had original maturities between one and 182 days.Total debt was approximately $12.9 billion and $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company had the ability to incur approximately an additional $2.0 billion of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under the Company’s $6.0 billion of credit facilities which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2015. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s financing activities and indebtedness, including the Company’s 50Table of Contentsoutstanding debt as of December 31, 2015, the financing for the Pall Acquisition and the Company’s commercial paper program and related credit facilities.Shelf Registration StatementThe Company has filed a “well-known seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance. The Company utilized this shelf registration statement for the offering and sale of the U.S. dollar and Euro-denominated senior unsecured notes issued to finance the Pall Acquisition. The Company expects to use net proceeds realized by the Company from future securities sales off this shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, including without limitation repayment or refinancing of debt or other corporate obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends and working capital.Stock Repurchase ProgramOn July 16, 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”) authorizing the repurchase of up to 20 million shares of the Company’s common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. There is no expiration date for the Repurchase Program, and the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will be determined by the Company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Company's equity compensation plans (or any successor plan) and for other corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2015, 20 million shares remained available for repurchase pursuant to the Repurchase Program. The Company expects to fund any future stock repurchases using the Company's available cash balances or proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper.Except in connection with the disposition of the Company's communications business to NetScout, neither the Company nor any “affiliated purchaser” repurchased any shares of Company common stock during 2015, 2014 or 2013. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the 26 million shares of Danaher common stock tendered to and repurchased by the Company in connection with the disposition of the Company's communications business to NetScout.DividendsThe Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.135 per share that was paid on January 29, 2016 to holders of record on December 21, 2015. Aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2015 were $354 million. Dividend payments were higher in 2015 as compared to 2014 as the Company increased its quarterly dividend rate in the first quarter of 2015 to $0.135 per share.Cash and Cash RequirementsAs of December 31, 2015, the Company held approximately $791 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment-grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an approximate weighted average annual interest rate of 0.01%. Of this amount, $36 million was held within the United States and $755 million was held outside of the United States. The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures and acquisitions, pay interest and service debt, pay taxes and any related interest or penalties, fund its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock, pay dividends to shareholders and support other business needs. With respect to the Company’s other cash requirements, the Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, particularly in connection with acquisitions, the Company may also borrow under its commercial paper programs or credit facilities, enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper programs and/or access the capital markets. The Company also may from time to time access the capital markets, including to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions. While repatriation of some cash held outside the United States may be restricted by local laws, most of the Company’s foreign cash balances could be repatriated to the United States but, under current law, would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. For most of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company makes an election regarding the amount of earnings intended for indefinite reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. The Company has recorded a deferred tax liability for the funds that are available to be repatriated to the United States. No provisions for U.S. income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, and the amount of U.S. income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the Company could employ if it repatriated these earnings. The cash that the 51Table of ContentsCompany’s foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments, including acquisitions. As of December 31, 2015, the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely and the basis difference in investments outside of the United States for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately $23.5 billion. As of December 31, 2015, management believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs, including its cash needs in the United States.During 2015, the Company contributed $49 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan and $53 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2016, the Company’s cash contribution requirements for its U.S. and its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans (including any pension plans to be assumed by the Fortive businesses that the Company anticipates spinning-off in 2016) are expected to be approximately $40 million and $55 million, respectively. The ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan’s funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates and other factors.Contractual ObligationsThe following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 under (1) long-term debt obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company’s balance sheet under GAAP. The amounts presented in the table below include $971 million of noncurrent gross unrecognized tax benefits. However, the timing of these liabilities is uncertain, and therefore, they have been included in the “More Than 5 Years” column in the table below. Refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits. Certain of the Company’s acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table below does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts of any such payments are uncertain. Refer to “—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” for a discussion of other contractual obligations that are not reflected in the table below.($ in millions)Total Less ThanOne Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than5 YearsDebt and leases: Long-term debt obligations (a)(b)$12,843.7 $841.6 $1,639.6 $6,308.0 $4,054.5Capital lease obligations (b)26.7 3.6 7.6 1.4 14.1Total long-term debt12,870.4 845.2 1,647.2 6,309.4 4,068.6Interest payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations (c)1,674.6 229.8 407.2 265.8 771.8Operating lease obligations (d)777.0 204.8 289.8 170.8 111.6Other: Purchase obligations (e)887.7 814.7 66.3 2.1 4.6Other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company’s balance sheet under GAAP (f)6,262.6 — 915.6 726.4 4,620.6Total$22,472.3 $2,094.5 $3,326.1 $7,474.5 $9,577.2 (a) As described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(b) Amounts do not include interest payments. Interest on long-term debt and capital lease obligations is reflected in a separate line in the table.(c) Interest payments on long-term debt are projected for future periods using the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2015. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates.(d) As described in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain leases require the Company to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises. These future costs are not included in the schedule above.(e) Consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction.(f) Primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies and allowances, performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs, self-insurance and litigation claims, postretirement benefits, pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities and deferred compensation obligations. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management’s estimates over the terms of these arrangements and is largely based upon historical experience.52Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of off-balance sheet commitments of the Company as of December 31, 2015. Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period($ in millions)Total Less ThanOne Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than5 YearsGuarantees$580.9 $415.1 $100.4 $26.2 $39.2Guarantees consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit, bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds. These guarantees have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors, customers, financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure the Company’s obligations and/or performance requirements related to specific transactions.Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters or tax matters. The Company has not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they relate to unknown conditions and the Company cannot estimate the potential liabilities from such matters, but the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. In addition, as a result of these divestitures, as well as restructuring activities, certain properties leased by the Company have been sublet to third parties. In the event any of these third parties vacate any of these premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by such sub-lessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the Company’s financial statements.In the normal course of business, the Company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers, suppliers or other business partners for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the Company’s products or services or claims alleging that Company products, services or software infringe third party intellectual property. The Company has not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual obligations table above. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations.The Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the Company, or by reason of serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to limited exceptions. Danaher’s Amended and Restated By-laws provide for similar indemnification rights. In addition, Danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of Danaher Corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which Danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding. While the Company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage.Legal ProceedingsPlease refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies, and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESManagement’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience, the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments.53Table of ContentsThe Company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to Note 1 in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.Acquired Intangibles—The Company’s business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill, in-process research and development and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the Company may incur. Refer to Notes 1, 2 and 6 in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s policies relating to goodwill, acquired intangibles and acquisitions.In performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market-based approach. The Company estimates fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the Company’s reporting units, in addition to recent market available sale transactions of comparable businesses. In evaluating the estimates derived by the market-based approach, management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected. In certain circumstances the Company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (i.e., an income approach) in order to validate the results of the market approach. The discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had 23 reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment. Management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units decreases as these businesses are integrated into the Company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth. The carrying value of the goodwill included in each individual reporting unit ranges from $7 million to approximately $9.4 billion. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2015 indicated that in all instances, the fair values of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 0% to approximately 900%. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this hypothetical 10% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units ranged from approximately -10% to approximately 800%. After applying the hypothetical 10% decrease, two reporting units’ hypothetical fair values were lower than their respective carrying values. Management evaluated other factors relating to the fair value of these reporting units, including as applicable results of the estimate of fair value using an income approach, the short period of time since the acquisition of these businesses, market positions of the businesses, comparability of market sales transactions and financial and operating performance, and concluded no impairment charge was required.The Company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company also tests intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. These analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues, expenses, market conditions and discount rates related to these assets.If actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the Company’s financial statements.Contingent Liabilities—As discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors, including those discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If the reserves established by 54Table of Contentsthe Company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s financial statements.Revenue Recognition—The Company derives revenues from the sale of products and services. Refer to Note 1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s revenue recognition policies. Although most of the Company’s sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, certain agreements contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. As a result, judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if so, how the consideration should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. The Company allocates revenue to each element in the contractual arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy that, in some instances, may require the Company to estimate the selling price of certain deliverables that are not sold separately or where third party evidence of pricing is not observable. The Company’s estimate of selling price impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements. The Company also enters into lease arrangements with customers, which requires the Company to determine whether the arrangements are operating or sales-type leases. Certain of the Company’s lease contracts are customized for larger customers and often result in complex terms and conditions that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criteria.If the Company’s judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect, the Company’s revenues in particular periods may be adversely affected. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits—For a description of the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit accounting practices, refer to Notes 10 and 11 in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations, including assumptions regarding discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rates of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. If the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change (as a result of differences in actual experience, changes in key economic indicators or other factors) the Company’s financial statements could be materially affected. A 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the U.S. net obligation by $147 million ($92 million on an after-tax basis) and the non-U.S. net obligation by $157 million ($118 million on an after-tax basis) from the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2015.For 2015, the estimated long-term rate of return for the U.S. plan is 7.5%, and the Company intends to use an assumption of 7.0% for 2016. Due to this decrease in the estimated long term rate of return on assets, there will be an increase in the expense of approximately $9 million in 2016. This expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected long-term returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets. The U.S. plan targets to invest between 60% and 70% of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments. The balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in bond funds. The Company’s non-U.S. plan assets consist of various insurance contracts, equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan. The estimated long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 1.10% to 6.00%. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2015 was reduced by 50 basis points, pension expense for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans for 2015 would have increased $9 million ($6 million on an after-tax basis) and $5 million ($4 million on an after-tax basis), respectively.Effective December 31, 2015, the Company changed its estimate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its U.S. and non-U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Previously, the Company estimated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation. The new estimate utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows. The new estimate provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. The change does not affect the measurement of the Company’s U.S. and non-U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and it is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle, which is applied prospectively. For fiscal 2016, the change in estimate is expected to reduce U.S. and non-U.S. pension and other postretirement net periodic benefit plan cost by $25 million when compared to the prior estimate.For a discussion of the Company’s 2015 and anticipated 2016 defined benefit pension plan contributions, please see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash and Cash Requirements”.55Table of ContentsIncome Taxes—For a description of the Company’s income tax accounting policies, refer to Notes 1 and 12 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized which requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding: (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. Future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial statements. The Company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when, based upon the technical merits, it is “more likely than not” that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. Judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions. The Company re-evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances, including when: (1) a tax audit is completed; (2) applicable tax laws change, including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (3) the applicable statute of limitations expires.In addition, certain of the Company’s tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in Denmark (see “—Results of Operations – Income Taxes” and Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws. However, the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in the Company being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact to the Company’s financial statements, including its effective tax rate.An increase in the Company’s nominal tax rate of 1.0% would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 of $33 million.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSIn December 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (“ASU 2015-17”). ASU 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The standard is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods and may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company has chosen to early adopt this ASU prospectively, and therefore, the 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects the new disclosure requirements.In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments (Topic 805), which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement-period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements. The ASU requires disclosure of the nature and amount of measurement-period adjustments as well as information with respect to the portion of the adjustments recorded in current-period earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustments to provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The Company has chosen to early adopt this ASU and therefore, disclosures included within these consolidated financial statements have been updated to reflect the new disclosure requirements.In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07, Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value Per Share (or its Equivalent) (“ASU 2015-07”). ASU 2015-07 removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy investments for which fair values are estimated using the net asset value practical expedient provided by Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurement. Disclosures about investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share are limited under the new standard to those investments for which the Plan has elected to estimate the fair value using the net asset value practical expedient. The ASU is effective for entities (other than public business entities) for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with retrospective application to all periods presented, with early adoption permitted. The Company has chosen to early adopt this ASU and therefore, disclosures included within these consolidated financial statements have been updated to reflect the new disclosure requirements.In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. This ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015 but the Company has chosen to early adopt the standard and has applied the guidance to all 2015 debt issuances. The Company did not retrospectively apply this guidance to debt offerings prior to 2015 as the impact to the consolidated financial statements was not material.56Table of ContentsIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which impacts virtually all aspects of an entity’s revenue recognition. The core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. On July 9, 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the standard by one year which results in the new standard being effective for the Company at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of the new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, including possible transition alternatives.ITEM 7A.

Risk Factors.”Major CustomersNo customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated sales in 2016, 2015 or 2014.Available InformationThe Company maintains an internet website at www.danaher.com. The Company makes available free of charge on the website its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material with, or furnishing such material to, the SEC. Danaher’s internet site and the information contained on or connected to that site are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, economic conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws, regulations or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.12Conditions in the global economy, the markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our business is sensitive to general economic conditions. Slower global economic growth, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt, volatility in the currency and credit markets, high levels of unemployment or underemployment, reduced levels of capital expenditures, changes or anticipation of potential changes in government fiscal, tax, trade and monetary policies, changes in capital requirements for financial institutions, government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics, sequestration, austerity measures and other challenges that affect the global economy adversely affect the Company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, including having the effect of:•reducing demand for our products and services (in this Annual Report, references to products and services also includes software), limiting the financing available to our customers and suppliers, increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies;•increasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories;•increasing price competition in our served markets; •supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; •increasing the risk of impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, and the risk that we may not be able to fully recover the value of other assets such as real estate and tax assets; and•increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which, in addition to increasing the risks identified above, could result in preference actions against us.Although we have been able to access the commercial paper and other capital markets through the date of this report, there can be no assurances that such markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations.If growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period, if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve, our business and financial statements could be adversely affected.Our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve, and visibility into our markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies, and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities. Demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in incentive programs, new product introductions and customer inventory levels. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period.We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share. Even if we compete effectively, we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services.Our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. Because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors; refer to “Item 1. Business—Competition” for additional details. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets, including high-growth markets. In addition, significant shifts in industry market share can occur in connection with product problems, safety alerts and publications about products, reflecting the competitive significance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems in our industry. Our failure to compete effectively and/or pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements, and our expansion into new markets may result in greater-than-expected risks, liabilities and expenses.13Our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation.We generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis, our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer. Our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to:•correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;•allocate our research and development funding to products and services with higher growth prospects;•anticipate and respond to our competitors’ development of new products and services and technological innovations;•differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings and avoid commoditization;•innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets;•obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies before our competitors do;•successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time;•obtain necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope, including with respect to medical device products by demonstrating satisfactory clinical results where applicable; and•stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies.In addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. In addition, promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, uncertainty over third-party reimbursement or entrenched patterns of clinical practice.Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.Certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. FDA and by comparable agencies of other countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information. Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements.Certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the U.S. FDA, by other federal and state governmental agencies, by comparable agencies of other countries and regions and by regulations governing radioactive or other hazardous materials and drugs-of abuse (or the manufacture and sale of products containing any such materials). We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance (such as 510(k) clearance) or approvals for 14our new products or modifications to (or additional indications or uses of) existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be time-consuming, costly and subject to restrictions. Our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors, for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results, and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained. Even after initial regulatory clearance or approval, if safety issues arise we may be required to amend conditions for use of a product, such as providing additional warnings on the product’s label or narrowing its approved intended use, which could reduce the product’s market acceptance. Failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products (or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products), other violations of these regulations, real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products (even after obtaining clearance for distribution) and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to FDA Form 483 Inspectional Observations, warning letters, notices to customers, declining sales, loss of customers, loss of market share, recalls, seizures of adulterated or misbranded products, injunctions, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, narrowing of permitted uses for a product, suspension or withdrawal of approvals and pre-market notification rescissions. We are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse, pricing and sales and marketing practices in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information, including the federal regulations described in “Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters.” Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in the adverse effects referenced below under “Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and our business, including our reputation.” Compliance with regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses.The health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, which could adversely affect our financial statements.The health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, including the following:•many of our customers, and the end-users to whom our customers supply products, rely on government funding of and reimbursement for health care products and services and research activities. The U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “PPACA”), health care austerity measures in other countries and other potential health care reform changes and government austerity measures may reduce the amount of government funding or reimbursement available to customers or end-users of our products and services and/or the volume of medical procedures using our products and services. Some countries also control the price of health care products, directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing or coverage limitations or through compulsory licensing. Global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement.•the PPACA imposes on medical device manufacturers, such as Danaher, a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of certain medical devices. While the excise tax has been suspended until the end of 2017, it may be reinstated in 2018 or beyond.•governmental and private health care providers and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the delivery of health care services, forming group purchasing organizations to improve their purchasing leverage and using competitive bid processes to procure health care products and services.These changes as well as other impacts from market demand, government regulations, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures have increased our tax liabilities and may cause participants in the health care industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services, reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products and services from governmental agencies or third-party payors, reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services and increase our compliance and other costs. In addition, we may be unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us, and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability. All of the factors described above could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price.Our ability to grow revenues, earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies. We may not be able to 15consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price. Promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including high valuations, competition among prospective buyers, the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms. In addition, competition for acquisitions may result in higher purchase prices. Changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions.Our acquisition of businesses (including our recent acquisitions of Pall and Cepheid), joint ventures and strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements.As part of our business strategy we acquire businesses and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course, and we also from time to time complete more material transactions; refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) for additional details. Acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our business and our financial statements:•any acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable, or we could fail to make such business profitable.•we may incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic relationships, which could also cause a deterioration of Danaher’s credit ratings, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense and diminish our future access to the capital markets.•acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic relationships could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations in any given period, or over the long-term.•pre-closing and post-closing earnings charges could adversely impact operating results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period-to-period.•acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic relationships could create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address.•we could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other controls and systems and retaining key employees and customers.•we may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition, joint venture or strategic relationship.•we may assume by acquisition, joint venture or strategic relationship unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company’s activities. The realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations.•in connection with acquisitions and joint ventures, we often enter into post-closing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments, earn-out obligations and indemnification obligations, which may have unpredictable financial results.•as a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet. If we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets.•we may have interests that diverge from those of our joint venture partners or other strategic partners and we may not be able to direct the management and operations of the joint venture or other strategic relationship in the manner we believe is most appropriate, exposing us to additional risk. The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the 16liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements.Divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements.We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest, spin-off, split-off or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. These transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements. For example, when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not become satisfied. In addition, divestitures or other dispositions may dilute the Company’s earnings per share, have other adverse financial and accounting impacts and distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. In addition, we have retained responsibility for and/or have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold or disposed. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.We could incur significant liability if the 2016 spin-off of Fortive or the 2015 split-off of our communications business is determined to be a taxable transaction.We have received opinions from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution of each of Fortive in 2016 and our communications business in 2015 qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code. These opinions rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, our stockholders and we may not be able to rely on the respective opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) could determine on audit that either or both separations are taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the respective opinion. If either transaction is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.Potential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the 2016 spin-off of Fortive and the 2015 split-off of our communications business could materially and adversely affect our business and financial statements.We entered into a separation and distribution agreement and related agreements with Fortive to govern the Separation and the relationship between the two companies going forward. We entered into similar agreements with NetScout Systems, Inc. in connection with the split-off of our communications business. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party and could lead to disputes between us. If we are required to indemnify the other parties under the circumstances set forth in these agreements, we may be subject to substantial liabilities. In addition, with respect to the liabilities for which the other parties have agreed to indemnify us under these agreements, there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against such other parties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of the liabilities, or that such other parties will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. It is also possible that a court could disregard the allocation of assets and liabilities agreed to between Danaher and such other parties and require Danaher to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to such other parties. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business and financial statements.A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers, other business partners and patients), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. In addition, some of our remote monitoring products and services incorporate software and information technology that may house personal data. These systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. In addition, security breaches of our systems (or the systems of our customers, suppliers or other business partners) could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure 17of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers. Like most multinational corporations, our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.If we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches, we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences. As a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. For example, in the United States, HIPAA privacy and security rules require certain of our operations to maintain controls to protect the availability and confidentiality of patient health information, individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy. European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe, and the new EU General Data Protection Regulation will impose significantly stricter requirements in how we collect and process personal data. Several countries, such as China and Russia, have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.Our operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.Our operations, products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment, establish standards for the use, generation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and impose end-of-life disposal and take-back programs. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the United States and abroad in connection with our operations. We cannot assure you that our environmental, health and safety compliance program has been or will at all times be effective. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements.In addition, we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury, property damage or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury or damage due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. We may also become subject to additional remedial, compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules. For additional information regarding these risks, refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. We cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. However, based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2016 will have a material effect on our financial statements.Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and our business, including our reputation.In addition to the environmental, health, safety, health care, medical device, anticorruption, data privacy and other regulations noted elsewhere in this Annual Report, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional levels, including the following:•we are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons and dealings between our employees and between our subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations 18may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory.•we also have agreements to sell products and services to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with government entities. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. Our agreements with government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification at the convenience of the government or in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors, and we may underestimate our costs of performing under the contract. In certain cases, a governmental entity may require us to pay back amounts it has paid to us. Government contracts that have been awarded to us following a bid process could become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder, which could result in loss of the contract. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts. These are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. The regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. We, our representatives and the industries in which we operate may at times be under review and/or investigation by regulatory authorities. Failure to comply (or any alleged or perceived failure to comply) with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and any such failure or alleged failure (or becoming subject to a regulatory enforcement investigation) could also damage our reputation, disrupt our business, limit our ability to manufacture, import, export and sell products and services, result in loss of customers and disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. Compliance with these and other regulations may also affect our returns on investment, require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our business. Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the International Standards Organization, and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our business and financial statements. For additional information regarding these risks, refer to “Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters.”Our restructuring actions could have long-term adverse effects on our business.In recent years, we have implemented significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. These restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities (including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses) reduce our available talent, assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases. In addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize from such actions. Any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements.We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.As of December 31, 2016, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $35.6 billion. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets, changes in the structure of our business, divestitures, market capitalization declines, or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized.Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements.Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products and services we purchase overseas. Sales and expenses of our non-U.S. businesses are also translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects. In addition, certain of our businesses may invoice customers in a currency other than the business’ functional currency, 19and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable translation effects. The Company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries.Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Refer to the MD&A for a discussion of the factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period. The impact of these factors may be substantially different from period-to-period. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities, such as the audits described in the MD&A and the Company’s financial statements. Due to the potential for changes to tax laws (or changes to the interpretation thereof) and the ambiguity of tax laws, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our intercompany arrangements and other factors, our estimates of income tax assets or liabilities may differ from actual payments, assessments or receipts. If these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected. If we determine to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have been considered permanently re-invested under existing accounting standards, it could also increase our effective tax rate. In addition, any significant change to the tax system in the United States or in other jurisdictions (including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below) could adversely affect our financial statements.Changes in tax law relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect our tax position.Recent legislative proposals seek to limit the ability of foreign-owned corporations to deduct interest expense, tax the accumulated unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations, impose a minimum tax on the future offshore earnings of U.S. multinational groups and make other changes in the taxation of multinational corporations. Additionally, the U.S. Congress, government agencies in non-U.S. jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting,” where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in low-tax jurisdictions, or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. The OECD has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for addressing base erosion and profit shifting. As a result, the tax laws in the United States and other countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect our business and financial statements.We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our business and financial statements.We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiture-related matters, as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement. We may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, divested businesses. The types of claims made in lawsuits include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. In addition, developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. We cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and business. However, based on our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2016 will have a material effect on our financial statements.If we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third-parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our business. The intellectual property rights that we obtain, 20however, may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. In addition, the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented, designed-around or becoming subject to compulsory licensing, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons, or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third-parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business, including our competitive position, and financial statements.Third-parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.From time to time, we receive notices from third-parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. Any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to critical technology, be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services, be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our business, including our competitive position, and financial statements. Even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.The United States government has certain rights to use and disclose some of the intellectual property that we license and could exclusively license it to a third-party if we fail to achieve practical application of the intellectual property.Certain technology licensed by us under agreements with third-party licensors may be subject to government rights. Government rights in inventions conceived or reduced to practice under a government-funded program may include a non-exclusive, royalty-free worldwide license to practice or have practiced such inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the United States government has the right to require us or our licensors (as applicable) to grant licenses which would be exclusive under any of such inventions to a third-party if they determine that: (1) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize such inventions in a particular field of use; (2) such action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (3) such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations. Further, the government rights include the right to use and disclose, without limitation, technical data relating to licensed technology that was developed in whole or in part at government expense.Defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products or services (including software) could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.Manufacturing or design defects or “bugs” in, unanticipated use of, safety or quality issues (or the perception of such issues) with respect to, “off label” use of, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell (including items that we source from third-parties) can lead to personal injury, death, property damage or other liability. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts, result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us. Recalls, removals and product liability and similar claims (regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome) can result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. Our business can also be affected by studies of the utilization, safety and efficacy of medical device products and components that are conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. Any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of product issues.21The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products, our reputation, business and financial statements could suffer.The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters and environmental factors, and if not discovered before the product is released to market could result in recalls and product liability exposure. Because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities and other stringent regulations of the FDA regarding the manufacture of certain of our products, an alternative manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity. Any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant costs, liability and lost revenue, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products.Our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow, and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements.As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $12.3 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, as of December 31, 2016 we had the ability to incur approximately an additional $1.1 billion of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under the Company’s $7.0 billion of credit facilities which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances. Our debt level and related debt service obligations can have negative consequences, including (1) requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and capital investment; (2) reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and (3) exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. We may incur significantly more debt in the future, particularly to finance acquisitions, and there can be no assurance that our cost of funding will not substantially increase.Our current revolving credit facilities and long-term debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us; for more information refer to the MD&A. If we breach any of these restrictions and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements. In addition, any failure to maintain the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies would adversely affect our cost of funds and could adversely affect our liquidity and access to the capital markets. If we add new debt, the risks described above could increase.Adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition, performance, purchasing patterns or inventory levels of, key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements.Certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and end-users. Some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products or compete with us directly, and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. Adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners, or adverse developments in their financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns, could adversely affect our business and financial statements. The levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners, and changes in those levels, can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period. In addition, the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries could adversely impact our business and financial statements.Certain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other third-parties for development, supply and marketing of certain products and potential products, and such collaborative partners or other third-parties could fail to perform sufficiently.We believe that for certain of our businesses, success in penetrating target markets depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies. Relying on collaborative relationships is risky because, among other things, our collaborative partners (1) may not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations; (2) may not obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner; (3) may be acquired by other companies and decide to terminate our collaborative partnership or become insolvent; (4) may compete with us; (5) may not agree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship; (6) may not have sufficient capital resources; and (7) may not agree to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms. Because these and other factors may be beyond our control, the development or commercialization of our products involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. If we or any of our collaborative partners terminate a collaborative arrangement, we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or we may need to cancel some development programs, which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.22Our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations.As discussed in “Item 1. Business—Materials,” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components, raw materials and other commodities. Prices for and availability of these components, raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past. Any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business. In addition, due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve, the cost-containment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to, if commodity prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions, or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs, we could experience lower margins and profitability and our financial statements could be adversely affected.If we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand, our profitability may suffer. In addition, our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials, components and services could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies.We purchase materials, components and equipment from third-parties for use in our manufacturing operations. Our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations, including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality. During a market upturn, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices. If we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand, we may not be able to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed, our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities. Conversely, in order to secure supplies for the production of products, we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer.In addition, some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, regulatory requirements, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. If these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, war, terrorist actions, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes. Any of these factors could result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies.Because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements. Any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our financial statements.Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses.We compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional regulations, such as regulations governing health and safety, the environment, food and drugs, privacy and electronic communications. We develop, configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. Any significant change in any of these regulations (or in the interpretation or application thereof) could reduce demand for, increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services, or could restrict our existing activities, products and services. In addition, in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations. In these markets, the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations, the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address or the repeal of existing regulations, could adversely affect demand. In addition, regulatory deadlines may result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period-to-period.Work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations.We have a number of U.S. collective bargaining units and various non-U.S. collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our financial statements and business, including our productivity and reputation.23International economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements.In 2016, approximately 62% of our sales were derived from customers outside the United States. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located outside the United States. Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the United States and increase the localization of our products and services, we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the United States, particularly in the high-growth markets. Our international business (and particularly our business in high-growth markets) is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations, including:•interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers; •differences in terms of sale, including payment terms;•local product preferences and product requirements;•changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, such as the devaluation of particular currencies;•trade protection measures, embargoes and import or export restrictions and requirements;•unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws;•limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash;•the potential for nationalization of enterprises;•changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs;•limitations on legal rights and our ability to enforce such rights;•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;•differing labor regulations;•difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis; and•differing protection of intellectual property.Any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and business, including our growth rate.The results of the EU membership referendum in the United Kingdom could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial statements.The results of the United Kingdom’s referendum on EU membership, advising for the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU, has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global stock markets, currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty. Although it is unknown what the terms of the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the EU will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and EU and increased regulatory complexities. Any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial statements.If we suffer loss to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed.Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, public health crisis, war, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. If any of these facilities, supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses. The third-party insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against such losses.Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements.The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets, investment losses on plan 24assets and changes in discount rates may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements. In addition, upward pressure on the cost of providing health care coverage to current employees and retirees may increase our future funding obligations and adversely affect our financial statements.ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNot applicable.ITEM 2. PROPERTIESDanaher’s corporate headquarters are located in Washington, D.C. in a facility that the Company leases. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had facilities in over 60 countries, including approximately 242 significant manufacturing and distribution facilities. 112 of these facilities are located in the United States in over 25 states and 130 are located outside the United States in over 34 other countries, primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia, the rest of North America, South America and Australia. These facilities cover approximately 21 million square feet, of which approximately 11 million square feet are owned and approximately 10 million square feet are leased. Particularly outside the United States, facilities often serve more than one business segment and may be used for multiple purposes, such as administration, sales, manufacturing, warehousing and/or distribution. The number of significant facilities by business segment is:•Life Sciences, 72;•Diagnostics, 77;•Dental, 46; and•Environmental & Applied Solutions, 47.The Company considers its facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used and does not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. The Company believes its properties and equipment have been well-maintained.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide a reader of Danaher’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of Company management. The Company’s MD&A is divided into five sections:•Overview•Results of Operations•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Critical Accounting Estimates•New Accounting StandardsThis discussion and analysis should be read along with Danaher’s audited financial statements and related Notes thereto as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 included in this Annual Report. Unless otherwise indicated, references to sales in this Annual Report refer to sales from continuing operations.OVERVIEWGeneralRefer to “Item 1. Business—General” for a discussion of Danaher’s objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value. Danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations. During 2016, approximately 62% of Danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the United States. As a diversified, global business, Danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors. Danaher’s geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of its products and services, help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. Given the broad range of products manufactured, services provided and geographies served, management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the Company. The Company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.As a result of the Company’s geographic and industry diversity, the Company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges, including rapid technological development (particularly with respect to computing, mobile connectivity, communications and digitization) in most of the Company’s served markets, the expansion and evolution of opportunities in high-growth markets, trends and costs associated with a global labor force, consolidation of the Company’s competitors and increasing regulation. The Company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and the Company’s long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in high-growth geographies and high-growth market segments, identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative and differentiated new products and services with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of the Company’s sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment. The Company is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources (particularly in high-growth markets) in order to be responsive to the Company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the Company’s operations. Business PerformanceConsolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 17.0% as compared to 2015. While differences exist among the Company’s businesses, on an overall basis, demand for the Company’s products and services increased at a similar rate in 2016 as compared to 2015. This demand, together with the Company’s continued investments in sales growth initiatives and the other business-specific factors discussed below, contributed to year-over-year sales growth from existing businesses of 3.0% (for the definition of “sales from existing businesses,” refer to “—Results of Operations” below). Geographically, both high-growth and developed markets contributed to year-over-year sales growth from existing businesses during 2016. Sales growth rates from existing businesses in high-growth markets grew at a high-single digit rate in 2016 as compared to 2015 led by strength in China, India and Latin America partially offset by weakness in Eastern Europe. High-growth markets represented approximately 29% of the Company’s total sales in 2016. Sales from existing businesses in developed markets grew at a low-single digit rate in 2016 as compared to 2015 and were driven by North America and Western Europe.29Table of ContentsThe acquisitions of Pall and Cepheid, as further discussed below, provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Company’s Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments, respectively, by expanding each segment’s geographic and product line diversity, including new and complementary product and service offerings in the area of life sciences, filtration, separation and purification technologies (in the case of Pall) and molecular diagnostics (in the case of Cepheid), and through the potential future acquisition of complementary businesses. As Pall and Cepheid are integrated into the Company, the Company also expects to realize significant cost synergies through the application of the Danaher Business System and the combined purchasing power of the Company, Pall and Cepheid.Fortive SeparationOn July 2, 2016, Danaher completed the Separation of its former Test & Measurement segment, Industrial Technologies segment (excluding the product identification businesses) and retail/commercial petroleum business by distributing to Danaher stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Fortive, the entity Danaher incorporated to hold such businesses. To effect the Separation, Danaher distributed to its stockholders one share of Fortive common stock for every two shares of Danaher common stock outstanding as of June 15, 2016, the record date for the distribution.During the second quarter of 2016, the Company received net cash distributions of approximately $3.0 billion from Fortive as consideration for the Company’s contribution of assets to Fortive in connection with the Separation (“Fortive Distribution”). Danaher used a portion of the cash distribution proceeds to repay the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.3% senior unsecured notes that matured in June 2016 and to redeem approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness in August 2016 (consisting of the Company’s 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2018, 5.4% senior unsecured notes due 2019 and 3.9% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (collectively the “Redeemed Notes”)). Danaher also paid an aggregate of $188 million in make-whole premiums in connection with the August 2016 redemptions, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company has also used, and intends to use, the balance of the Fortive Distribution to fund certain of the Company’s regular, quarterly cash dividends to shareholders. The accounting requirements for reporting the Separation of Fortive as a discontinued operation were met when the Separation was completed. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented reflect this business as a discontinued operation. The Company allocated a portion of the consolidated interest expense and income to discontinued operations based on the ratio of the discontinued business’ net assets to the Company’s consolidated net assets. Fortive had revenues of approximately $3.0 billion in 2016 prior to the Separation and approximately $6.1 billion in 2015. As a result of the Separation, the Company incurred $48 million in Separation-related costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 which are included in earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. These Separation costs primarily relate to professional fees associated with preparation of regulatory filings and Separation activities within finance, tax, legal and information system functions as well as certain investment banking fees and tax liabilities incurred upon the Separation. AcquisitionsOn November 4, 2016, Copper Merger Sub, Inc., a California corporation and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Cepheid, a California corporation, for $53.00 per share in cash, for a total purchase price of approximately $4.0 billion, including assumed debt and net of acquired cash (the “Cepheid Acquisition”). Cepheid is a leading global molecular diagnostics company that develops, manufactures and markets accurate and easy to use molecular systems and tests and is now part of the Company’s Diagnostics segment. Cepheid generated revenues of $539 million in 2015. The Company financed the Cepheid acquisition price with available cash and proceeds from the issuance of U.S. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper. In addition to the Cepheid Acquisition, during 2016 the Company acquired seven businesses for total consideration of $882 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company’s four segments. The aggregate annual sales of these seven businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $237 million. For a discussion of the Company’s 2015 and 2014 acquisition and disposition activity, refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Investing Activities”.Sale of InvestmentsThe Company received $265 million of cash proceeds from the sale of certain marketable equity securities during 2016. The Company recorded a pretax gain related to this sale of $223 million ($140 million after-tax or $0.20 per diluted share).30Table of ContentsFor a discussion of the Company’s 2015 and 2014 sale of investments activity, refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Investing Activities”.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSIn this report, references to sales from existing businesses refer to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) but excluding (1) sales from acquired businesses and (2) the impact of currency translation. References to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to GAAP sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales and operating profit, as applicable, attributable to divested product lines not considered discontinued operations. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses) and (b) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. Sales from existing businesses should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting the non-GAAP financial measure of sales from existing businesses provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in Danaher’s business and facilitating easier comparisons of Danaher’s revenue performance with its performance in prior and future periods and to Danaher’s peers. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from sales from existing businesses because currency translation is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestiture related items because the nature, size and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period-to-period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. Throughout this discussion, references to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales and references to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies resulting from the application of the Danaher Business System.Sales Growth (GAAP) 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014Total sales growth17.0% 12.0%Components of Sales Growth (non-GAAP) 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014Existing businesses3.0 % 3.5 %Acquisitions15.0 % 15.5 %Currency exchange rates(1.0)% (7.0)%Total17.0 % 12.0 %Sales from existing businesses grew on a year-over-year basis in all segments in both 2016 and 2015. Sales from acquired businesses grew on a year-over-year basis in both years primarily due to the acquisitions of Pall in the third quarter of 2015 and Cepheid in the fourth quarter of 2016. The impact of currency translation reduced on a year-over-year basis reported sales in both years as the U.S. dollar was, on average, stronger against other major currencies.Operating profit margins were 16.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 15.0% in 2015. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.2016 vs. 2015 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by: •Higher 2016 sales volumes from existing businesses and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2016 and 2015, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments and the effect of a stronger U.S. dollar in 2016 - 115 basis points•Acquisition-related charges in 2015 associated with the acquisition of Pall, including transaction costs deemed significant, change in control payments, and fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue, net of the positive impact of freezing pension benefits - 90 basis points31Table of Contents•Acquisition-related charges in the first quarter of 2015 associated with the acquisition of Nobel Biocare, primarily related to fair value adjustments to acquired inventory - 15 basis points•The 2016 gains on resolution of acquisition-related matters - 10 basis points2016 vs. 2015 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:•Acquisition-related charges in 2016 associated primarily with the acquisition of Cepheid, including transaction costs deemed significant, change in control and restructuring payments, and fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue - 50 basis points•The incremental net dilutive effect in 2016 of acquired businesses - 50 basis pointsThe Company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant (generally relating to the Company’s larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for the Company in a given period.Operating profit margins were 15.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 15.9% in 2014.

This growth was partially offset by declines in the overall market in Japan and softness in demand in the clinical end-market in North America. Sales of microscopy products were essentially flat on a year-over-year basis with growth in demand in North America and China offset by declines in Japan. Year-over-year demand for the business’ flow cytometry and particle counting products grew in 2016, led by increases in demand in North America, Western Europe and China.The acquisition of Pall in August 2015 contributed the majority of the increase in sales from acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Pall’s revenues grew on a year-over-year basis compared to the business’ 2015 results, led by continued growth in the life sciences business primarily due to demand for biopharmaceutical solutions including single-use technologies, partially offset by soft demand in the industrial business as a result of overall market weakness.Operating profit margins increased 540 basis points during 2016 as compared to 2015. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.2016 vs. 2015 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:•Higher 2016 sales volumes from existing businesses and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2016 and 2015, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments and the effect of a stronger U.S. dollar in 2016 - 175 basis points•Acquisition-related charges in 2015 associated with the acquisition of Pall, including transaction costs deemed significant, change in control payments, and fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue, net of the positive impact of freezing pension benefits - 390 basis points33Table of Contents2016 vs. 2015 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:•Acquisition-related charges in 2016, including transaction costs deemed significant, change in control and restructuring payments, and fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue - 10 basis points•The incremental net dilutive effect in 2016 of acquired businesses - 15 basis pointsDepreciation and amortization expense increased during 2016 as compared to 2015 due primarily to the impact of recently acquired businesses, particularly Pall.2015 Compared to 2014 Price increases in the segment contributed 0.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2015 as compared with 2014 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s life sciences business grew at a low-single digit rate during 2015 as compared to 2014.

Continued strong year-over-year demand for implant solutions, particularly in China and North America, and increased demand for orthodontic products, primarily in China and Russia, drove growth during 2016. Dental equipment sales also increased during 2016, primarily in high-growth markets and North America partially offset by weaker demand in Western Europe. Lower demand for dental consumable product lines in North America and the Middle East partially offset this year-over-year growth in 2016.Operating profit margins increased 160 basis points during 2016 as compared to 2015. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.2016 vs. 2015 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:•Higher 2016 sales volumes from existing businesses and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2016 and 2015, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments and the effect of a stronger U.S. dollar in 2016 - 90 basis points•Acquisition-related charges in the first quarter of 2015 associated with the acquisition of Nobel Biocare, primarily related to fair value adjustments to acquired inventory - 80 basis points2016 vs. 2015 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:•The incremental net dilutive effect in 2016 of acquired businesses - 10 basis points2015 Compared to 2014 Price increases in the segment contributed 0.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2015 as compared with 2014 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.Sales from existing businesses were flat on a year-over-year basis as increased demand for dental treatment units and consumable products, including orthodontic products, primarily in China and other high-growth markets, was offset by softness in demand for imaging products, largely due to destocking in the North American distribution channel, and weaker demand in Western Europe. Lower year-over-year demand for dental equipment in the Middle East due to slower project activity during 2015 also adversely impacted year-over-year performance. The acquisition of Nobel Biocare in December 2014 has provided additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Company’s Dental segment by expanding the businesses’ geographic and product line diversity, including new and complementary product and service offerings in the area of implant based tooth replacements.37Table of ContentsOperating profit margins declined 40 basis points during 2015 as compared to 2014.

Year-over-year sales in the analytical instrumentation product line grew, as increases in sales to the U.S. municipal end-market and Western Europe were partially offset by lower demand in Eastern Europe and China. Year-over-year sales growth in the business’ chemical treatment solutions product line was due primarily to an expansion of the customer base in the United States. Chemical treatment solutions saw an improvement in commodity oriented end-markets in Latin America in the fourth quarter of 2016 after declining growth in the earlier portion of 2016. Sales in the business’ ultraviolet water disinfection product line grew on a year-over-year basis due primarily to higher demand in municipal and industrial end-markets in Western Europe, China and Australia. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s product identification businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2016 as compared with 2015. Continued strong year-over-year demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables in most major geographies, led by North America, Western Europe and Latin America, drove the majority of the sales growth. Demand for the business’ packaging and color solutions was flat year-over-year, as sales growth in the second half of the year was offset by weakness in the first half of the year. Geographically, increased demand in the high-growth markets was offset by weaker demand in North America and Europe.Operating profit margins declined 80 basis points during 2016 as compared to 2015. The following factors unfavorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons:•The incremental net dilutive effect in 2016 of acquired businesses - 75 basis points•Incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments and the effect of a stronger U.S. dollar in 2016, net of higher 2016 sales volumes from existing businesses and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2016 and 2015 - 5 basis points 2015 Compared to 2014Price increases in the segment contributed 1.0% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2015 as compared with 2014 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s water quality businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2015 as compared with 2014. Sales growth in the analytical instrumentation product line continued to be led by strong sales of instruments and related consumables and services in North America, primarily in the U.S. municipal end-market, Europe and China (although growth slowed sequentially in China during the fourth quarter of 2015, partly due to delays in government projects). Year-over-year sales growth in the business’ chemical treatment solutions product line was due to continued growth in the United States as well as continued business expansion in Latin America. Sales in the business’ ultraviolet water disinfection product line grew on a year-over-year basis due to continued demand in industrial disinfection end-markets in the United States and municipal end-markets in the United States and Western Europe.Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s product identification businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2015 as compared with 2014, due to continued increased demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables as well as packaging and color solutions. Geographically, year-over-year sales growth was led by North America and Europe (although North America declined slightly in the fourth quarter of 2015), but was partly offset by softer demand for the business’ packaging and color solutions in Brazil and Russia.Operating profit margins increased 230 basis points during 2015 as compared to 2014.

This increase in cost of sales was partially offset by year-over-year cost savings at recently acquired businesses, particularly Pall, incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring and continued productivity improvement actions taken in 2016 and 2015, and the year-over-year decrease in acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory which decreased cost of sales by $85 million during 2016 as compared to 2015.The year-over-year increase in cost of sales during 2015 as compared with 2014, is due primarily to the impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, including sales volumes from recently acquired businesses, and 2015 acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory in connection with the acquisition of Pall and Nobel Biocare during the third quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2014, respectively, which increased cost of sales by $106 million during 2015. These factors were partially offset by lower year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2015 and 2014.The year-over-year increase in gross profit margins during 2016 as compared with 2015 is due primarily to the favorable impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2016 and 2015 and improved gross profit margins on a year-over-year basis at recently acquired businesses, particularly Pall. In addition, the acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue were higher in 2015 than 2016, which improved gross profit margins by 50 basis points during 2016 as compared with 2015.The year-over-year increase in gross profit margins during 2015 as compared with 2014 is due primarily to the favorable impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, higher gross profit margins of recently acquired businesses and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2015 and 2014. These positive factors more than offset the increase in acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue in connection with the acquisition of Pall and Nobel Biocare during the third quarter of 2015 and the fourth quarter of 2014, respectively, which adversely impacted gross profit margins comparisons by 80 basis points during 2015 as compared with 2014.OPERATING EXPENSES For the Year Ended December 31($ in millions)2016 2015 2014Sales$16,882.4 $14,433.7 $12,866.9Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses(5,608.6) (4,747.5) (4,035.1)Research and development (“R&D”) expenses(975.1) (861.4) (769.4)SG&A as a % of sales33.2% 32.9% 31.4%R&D as a % of sales5.8% 6.0% 6.0%40Table of ContentsThe increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales from 2015 to 2016 was driven by continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives and higher relative spending levels at recently acquired businesses. Change in control payments and restructuring costs in connection with the acquisition of Cepheid, as well as associated transaction costs, also increased SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales by 35 basis points during 2016. These increases were partially offset by the benefit of increased leverage of the Company’s general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2016 sales, lower year-over-year costs associated continuing productivity improvement initiatives and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2016 and 2015 as well as the benefit of lower Pall acquisition charges in 2016 compared to 2015 as described below.SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales increased 150 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2015 compared with 2014. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales from 2014 to 2015 was driven by continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives and higher relative spending levels at recently acquired businesses. Change in control payments to Pall employees in connection with the acquisition of Pall, as well as associated transaction costs and amortization charges associated with acquisition-related intangible assets, net of the positive impact of freezing pension benefits, adversely impacted SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales by 30 basis points during 2015. These increases were partially offset by the benefit of increased leverage of the Company’s general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2015 sales, lower year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2015 and 2014.R&D expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) as a percentage of sales declined in 2016 as compared with 2015 due primarily to lower R&D expenses as a percentage of sales in the businesses most recently acquired, particularly Pall, as well as year-over-year differences in the timing of investments in the Company’s new product development initiatives. R&D expenses as a percentage of sales were flat in 2015 as compared to 2014.NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) In the third quarter of 2016, the Company paid $188 million of make-whole premiums associated with the early extinguishment of the Redeemed Notes. The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of these borrowings, net of certain deferred gains, of $179 million ($112 million after-tax or $0.16 per diluted share).The Company received $265 million of cash proceeds from the sale of certain marketable equity securities during the first quarter of 2016. The Company recorded a pretax gain related to this sale of $223 million ($140 million after-tax or $0.20 per diluted share).During 2015, the Company received cash proceeds of $43 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and recorded a pretax gain related to these sales of $12 million ($8 million after-tax or $0.01 per diluted share).During 2014, the Company received cash proceeds of $167 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and recorded a pretax gain related to these sales of $123 million ($77 million after-tax or $0.11 per diluted share). INTEREST COSTSInterest expense of $184 million for 2016 was $45 million higher than in 2015, due primarily to the higher interest costs associated with the debt issued in the second half of 2015 in connection with the 2015 acquisition of Pall, partially offset by decreases in interest costs as a result of the early extinguishment of the Redeemed Notes in the third quarter of 2016 using the proceeds from the Fortive Distribution. For a further description of the Company’s debt as of December 31, 2016 refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest expense of $140 million in 2015 was $45 million higher than the 2014 interest expense of $95 million due primarily to the higher interest costs associated with the debt issued in the second half of 2015 in connection with the acquisition of Pall.INCOME TAXESGeneralIncome tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the Company’s financial statements. The Company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.The Company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and 41Table of Contentsexaminations of previously filed tax returns (as discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws, including legislative policy changes that may result from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s initiative on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and potential tax reform in the United States. For a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, refer to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash and Cash Requirements” below.The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis. Based on these reviews, the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities, tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations, reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary. For a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.Year-Over-Year Changes in the Tax Provision and Effective Tax RateThe Company’s effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was 17.5%, 14.4% and 21.5%, respectively.The Company’s effective tax rate for each of 2016, 2015 and 2014 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35.0% due principally to the Company’s earnings outside the United States that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate. •The effective tax rate of 17.5% in 2016 includes 350 basis points of net tax benefits from permanent foreign exchange losses and the release of reserves upon the expiration of statutes of limitation and audit settlements, partially offset by income tax expense related to repatriation of earnings and legal entity realignments associated with the Separation and changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions.•The effective tax rate of 14.4% in 2015 includes 290 basis points of net tax benefits from permanent foreign exchange losses, releases of valuation allowances related to foreign operating losses and the release of reserves upon the expiration of statutes of limitation, partially offset by changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions.•The effective tax rate of 21.5% in 2014 includes 250 basis points of tax expense for audit settlements in various jurisdictions, partially offset by the release of valuation allowances and the release of reserves upon the expiration of statutes of limitation.The Company conducts business globally, and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the United States federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. The countries in which the Company has a material presence that have significantly lower statutory tax rates than the United States include China, Denmark, Germany, Singapore, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The Company’s ability to obtain a tax benefit from lower statutory tax rates outside of the United States depends on its levels of taxable income in these foreign countries and the amount of foreign earnings which are indefinitely reinvested in those countries. The Company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements given the geographic dispersion of the Company’s taxable income. The Company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities. The IRS has completed substantially all of the examinations of the Company’s federal income tax returns through 2010 and is currently examining certain of the Company’s federal income tax returns for 2011 through 2013. In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and various other countries, states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2004 through 2015. Tax authorities in Denmark have raised significant issues related to interest accrued by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. On December 10, 2013, the Company received assessments from the Danish tax authority (“SKAT”) totaling approximately DKK 1.4 billion (approximately $195 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2016) including interest through December 31, 2016, imposing withholding tax relating to interest accrued in Denmark on borrowings from certain of the Company’s subsidiaries for the years 2004-2009. The Company is currently in discussions with SKAT and anticipates receiving an assessment for years 2010-2012 totaling approximately DKK 814 million (approximately $115 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2016). Management believes the positions the Company has taken in Denmark are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and is vigorously defending its positions. The Company appealed these assessments with the National Tax Tribunal in 2014 and intends on pursuing this matter through the European Court of Justice should this appeal 42Table of Contentsbe unsuccessful. The ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, could take many years, and could result in a material adverse impact to the Company’s financial statements, including its effective tax rate. As previously disclosed, German tax authorities had raised issues related to the deductibility and taxability of interest accrued by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the German tax authorities to resolve these open matters through 2014. The Company recorded €49 million (approximately $60 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2014) of expense for taxes and interest related to this settlement during the fourth quarter of 2014. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2017 is expected to be approximately 21%. Any future legislative changes or potential tax reform in the United States or other jurisdictions could cause the Company’s effective tax rate to differ from this estimate. This expected rate reflects the anticipated discrete income tax benefits from excess tax deductions related to the Company’s stock compensation programs, which will be reflected as a reduction in tax expense beginning in 2017 (refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to this change in accounting guidance).DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS As further discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, discontinued operations includes the results of the Fortive businesses which were disposed of during the third quarter 2016 as well as the results of the Company’s former communications business which was disposed of during the third quarter of 2015. All periods presented have been restated to reflect the Fortive and communications businesses within discontinued operations. In 2016, earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, were $400 million and reflected the operating results of the Fortive businesses prior to the Separation. In 2015 and 2014, earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, were approximately $1.6 billion and $960 million, respectively and reflected the operations of both the Fortive and communications businesses as well as the gain on the sale of the communications business in 2015.COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEComprehensive income decreased by $617 million in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to the impact of decreases in net earnings attributable to discontinued operations, foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to most major currencies during the year but at a lower rate than in the prior year, and pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments. The Company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $517 million for 2016 compared to a translation loss of $976 million for 2015. The Company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit loss of $58 million for 2016 compared to a gain of $81 million for 2015.Comprehensive income increased by approximately $1.5 billion in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to the impact of increases in net earnings (including those attributable to discontinued operations), foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to most major currencies during the year but at a lower rate than in the prior year, and pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments. The Company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $976 million for 2015 compared to a translation loss of approximately $1.2 billion for 2014. Pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments resulted in a gain of $81 million in 2015 compared to a loss of $361 million in 2014.INFLATIONThe effect of inflation on the Company’s revenues and net earnings was not significant in any of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014.FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENTThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices as well as credit risk, each of which could impact its financial statements. The Company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. In addition, the Company’s broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole.Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. A change in interest rates on long-term debt impacts the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt but not the Company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall 43Table of Contentsand decrease as interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2016, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt (excluding the LYONs, which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from the value of its underlying common stock) by approximately $335 million.As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s variable-rate debt obligations consisted primarily of U.S. dollar and euro-based commercial paper borrowings (refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2016). As a result, the Company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term interest rates. As these shorter duration obligations mature, the Company anticipates issuing additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. In 2016, the average annual interest rate associated with outstanding commercial paper borrowings was approximately 10 basis points. A hypothetical increase of this average to 20 basis points would have increased the Company’s annual interest expense by $7 million.Currency Exchange Rate RiskThe Company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than Danaher’s functional currency or the functional currency of its applicable subsidiary. The Company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign operations into U.S. dollars, Danaher’s functional currency. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the Company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of stockholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2016 would have resulted in a reduction of stockholders’ equity of approximately $1.6 billion.Currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2016 reported sales by 1.0% on a year-over-year basis as the U.S. dollar was, on average, stronger against most major currencies during 2016 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2015. If the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2016 were to prevail throughout 2017, currency exchange rates would adversely impact 2017 estimated sales by approximately 2.5% relative to the Company’s performance in 2016. Additional strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would further adversely impact the Company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis. Any weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would positively impact the Company’s sales and results of operations.The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk, although the Company’s foreign currency-denominated debt partially hedges its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales, profit, and assets and liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.Equity Price RiskThe Company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio includes publicly traded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale investments due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the equity securities. A 10% decline in the value of these equity securities as of December 31, 2016 would have reduced the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio by $17 million.Commodity Price RiskFor a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices, refer “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”44Table of ContentsCredit RiskThe Company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, receivables from customers and derivatives. The Company places cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the Company’s customers. The Company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate.The Company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and such transactions are generally insignificant to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. These transactions are typically entered into with high-quality financial institutions and exposure at any one institution is limited.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESManagement assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses, consummating strategic acquisitions, paying interest and servicing debt and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis.Following is an overview of the Company’s cash flows and liquidity for the years ended December 31:Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity($ in millions)2016 2015 2014Total operating cash flows provided by continuing operations$3,087.5 $2,832.2 $2,671.2 Cash paid for acquisitions$(4,880.1) $(14,247.8) $(2,839.4)Payments for additions to property, plant and equipment(589.6) (512.9) (465.4)Payments for purchases of investments— (87.1) —Proceeds from sales of investments264.8 43.0 167.1All other investing activities31.7 66.3 16.5Total investing cash used in discontinued operations(69.8) (212.5) (323.1)Net cash used in investing activities$(5,243.0) $(14,951.0)$(3,444.3) Proceeds from the issuance of common stock$164.5 $249.0 $132.9Payment of dividends(399.8) (354.1) (227.7)Make-whole premiums to redeem borrowings prior to maturity(188.1) — —Net proceeds from borrowings (maturities of 90 days or less)2,218.1 3,511.2 312.2Proceeds from borrowings (maturities longer than 90 days)3,240.9 5,682.9 —Repayments of borrowings (maturities longer than 90 days)(2,480.6) (35.5) (414.7)All other financing activities(27.0) (3.3) (20.9)Cash distributions to Fortive Corporation, net(485.3) — —Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$2,042.7 $9,050.2 $(218.2)•Operating cash flows from continuing operations increased $255 million, or approximately 9%, during 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to higher net earnings which also included higher noncash charges for depreciation, amortization and stock compensation. Higher levels of investment in working capital during 2016 compared with 2015 partially offset the increase in operating cash flows for the year.45Table of Contents•Cash paid for acquisitions constituted the most significant use of cash during 2016. The Company acquired eight businesses during 2016, including the acquisition of Cepheid, for total consideration (including assumed debt and net of cash acquired) of approximately $4.9 billion.•On July 2, 2016 Danaher completed the Fortive Separation. Prior to the Separation, Fortive provided approximately $3.0 billion of net cash distributions to Danaher.•The Company used a portion of the Fortive Distribution proceeds to repay the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.3% senior unsecured notes that matured in June 2016 and to redeem approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness in August 2016 (consisting of the Redeemed Notes). Danaher also paid an aggregate of $188 million in make-whole premiums in connection with the August 2016 redemptions, plus accrued and unpaid interest. •The Company also generated $2.2 billion of net proceeds from the issuances of commercial paper borrowings, which were primarily used to fund the Cepheid Acquisition.•The Company distributed cash of $485 million, in addition to approximately $2.0 billion of noncash net assets, to Fortive in connection with the Separation.•As of December 31, 2016, the Company held $964 million of cash and cash equivalents.Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows.Operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $3.1 billion for 2016, an increase of $255 million, or approximately 9%, as compared to 2015. The year-over-year change in operating cash flows from 2015 to 2016 was primarily attributable to the following factors:•2016 operating cash flows benefited from higher net earnings as compared to 2015 (excluding the 2016 impact of the gain from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and the loss on early extinguishment of borrowings which are included in nonoperating income (expense)). The cash flow impact of the nonoperating gain from the sale of certain marketable equity securities is reflected in investing activities while the cash flow impact of the nonoperating loss on the early extinguishment of borrowings is reflected in financing activities, and therefore, these do not contribute to operating cash flows.•The aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable used $96 million in operating cash flows during 2016, compared to providing operating cash flows of $198 million in 2015. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively the Company manages the cash conversion cycle, which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day it pays for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from its customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period.•The aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets, deferred income taxes and accrued expenses and other liabilities used $184 million in operating cash flows during 2016, compared to $84 million used in 2015. The timing of cash payments for income taxes and various employee related liabilities, including with respect to recently acquired companies, drove the majority of this change.•Net earnings from continuing operations for 2016 reflected an increase of $247 million of depreciation and amortization expense as compared to 2015. Amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions. Depreciation expense relates to both the Company’s manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operating-type lease arrangements. Depreciation and amortization are noncash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows.Operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $2.8 billion for 2015, an increase of $161 million, or 6% as compared to 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in net earnings in 2015 as compared to 2014. 46Table of ContentsInvesting ActivitiesCash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures, including instruments leased to customers, cash used for investments and cash proceeds from divestitures of businesses or assets.Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $5.2 billion during 2016 compared to approximately $15.0 billion and approximately $3.4 billion of net cash used in 2015 and 2014, respectively.Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of Investments2016 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of InvestmentsFor a discussion of the Company’s 2016 acquisitions, divestitures and the sale of certain marketable equity securities, refer to “—Overview.”2015 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of InvestmentsOn August 31, 2015, Pentagon Merger Sub, Inc., a New York corporation and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pall, a New York corporation, for $127.20 per share in cash, for a total purchase price of approximately $13.6 billion, net of assumed debt of $417 million and acquired cash of approximately $1.2 billion (the “Pall Acquisition”). Pall is part of the Company’s Life Sciences segment. In its fiscal year ended July 31, 2015, Pall generated consolidated revenues of approximately $2.8 billion.The Company financed the approximately $13.6 billion acquisition price of Pall with approximately $2.5 billion of available cash, approximately $8.1 billion of net proceeds from the issuance and sale of U.S. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper and €2.7 billion (approximately $3.0 billion based on currency exchange rates as of the date of issuance) of net proceeds from the issuance and sale of euro-denominated senior unsecured notes. Subsequent to the Pall Acquisition, the Company used the approximately $2.0 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes and the approximately CHF 755 million ($732 million based on currency exchange rates as of date of issuance) of net proceeds, including the related premium, from the issuance and sale of Swiss franc-denominated senior unsecured bonds to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance the Pall Acquisition.In addition to the Pall Acquisition, during 2015 the Company acquired nine businesses for total consideration of approximately $670 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company’s four segments. The aggregate annual sales of these nine businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $355 million.In July 2015, the Company consummated the split-off of the majority of its former communications business to Danaher shareholders who elected to exchange Danaher shares for ownership interests in the communications business, and the subsequent merger of the communications business with a subsidiary of NetScout. Danaher shareholders who participated in the exchange offer tendered 26 million shares of Danaher common stock (approximately $2.3 billion on the date of tender) and received 62.5 million shares of NetScout common stock which represented approximately 60% of the shares of NetScout common stock outstanding following the combination. The accounting requirements for reporting the disposition of the communications business as a discontinued operation were met when the split-off and merger were completed. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented reflect this business as discontinued operations. The Company allocated a portion of the consolidated interest expense to discontinued operations based on the ratio of the discontinued business’ net assets to the Company’s consolidated net assets. The Company recorded an aggregate after-tax gain on the disposition of this business of $767 million, or $1.08 per diluted share, in its 2015 results in connection with the closing of this transaction representing the value of the 26 million shares of Company common stock tendered for the communications business in excess of the carrying value of the business’ net assets. This gain was included in the results of discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. The communications business had revenues of $346 million in 2015 prior to the disposition and $760 million in 2014.During 2015, the Company received cash proceeds of $43 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and recorded a pretax gain related to these sales of $12 million.2014 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of InvestmentsIn December 2014, the Company completed its tender offer for the outstanding shares of common stock of Nobel Biocare and acquired substantially all of the Nobel Biocare shares, with the remainder of the Nobel Biocare shares acquired in 2015 pursuant to a squeeze-out transaction, for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately CHF 1.9 billion (approximately 47Table of Contents$1.9 billion based on exchange rates as of the date the shares of common stock were acquired) including debt assumed and net of cash acquired. Nobel Biocare had revenues of €567 million in 2013 (approximately $780 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2013), and is now part of the Company’s Dental segment. The Company financed the acquisition of Nobel Biocare from available cash. In addition to the acquisition of Nobel Biocare, during 2014 the Company acquired 10 businesses for total consideration of $978 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company’s four segments. The aggregate annual sales of these 10 businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $285 million.During 2014, the Company received cash proceeds of $167 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and recorded a pretax gain related to these sales of $123 million ($77 million after-tax or $0.11 per diluted share).Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development, improving information technology systems and the manufacture of instruments that are used in operating-type lease arrangements that certain of the Company’s businesses enter into with customers. Capital expenditures totaled $590 million in 2016, $513 million in 2015 and $465 million in 2014. The increase in capital spending in 2016 is due to increased investments in machinery and equipment, including operating assets at newly acquired businesses such as Pall, and to a lesser extent, increases in equipment leased to customers. The increase in capital spending in 2015 is due to investments in machinery and equipment, including operating assets at newly acquired businesses such as Nobel Biocare and Pall, partially offset by year-over-year differences in the timing of investments in equipment leased to customers. In 2017, the Company expects capital spending to be approximately $750 million, though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions.Financing ActivitiesCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper and other debt, issuances and repurchases of common stock, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and payments of cash dividends to shareholders. Financing activities provided cash of approximately $2.0 billion during 2016 compared to approximately $9.1 billion of cash provided during 2015. Cash provided by financing activities in 2016 primarily relates to approximately $3.4 billion of net proceeds received from the issuance of the Fortive Debt in June 2016 and the net issuance of outstanding borrowings with maturities of 90 days or less, primarily commercial paper borrowings, of approximately $2.2 billion, and the issuance of approximately ¥29.9 billion aggregate principal amount (approximately $262 million based on the currency exchange rate as of the date of the issuance) of 0.352% senior unsecured notes. These issuances were partially offset by the repayment of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.3% senior unsecured notes that matured in June 2016, the repayment of approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness in August 2016 (consisting of the Redeemed Notes), the repayment of the $124 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.0% senior unsecured notes due in October 2016 and $485 million of cash distributed to Fortive in connection with the Separation. Total debt was approximately $12.3 billion and $12.9 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company had the ability to incur approximately an additional $1.1 billion of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under the Company’s $7.0 billion of credit facilities which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2016. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s financing activities and indebtedness, including the Company’s outstanding debt as of December 31, 2016, and the Company’s commercial paper program and related credit facilities.Shelf Registration StatementThe Company has filed a “well-known seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance. The Company utilized this shelf registration statement for the offering and sale of the U.S. dollar and euro-denominated senior unsecured notes issued to finance the Pall Acquisition. The Company expects to use net proceeds realized by the Company from future securities sales off this shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, including without limitation repayment or refinancing of debt or other corporate obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends and working capital.Stock Repurchase ProgramOn July 16, 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”) authorizing 48Table of Contentsthe repurchase of up to 20 million shares of the Company’s common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. There is no expiration date for the Repurchase Program, and the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will be determined by the Company’s management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Company’s equity compensation plans (or any successor plan) and for other corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2016, 20 million shares remained available for repurchase pursuant to the Repurchase Program. The Company expects to fund any future stock repurchases using the Company’s available cash balances or proceeds from the issuance of indebtedness.Except in connection with the disposition of the Company’s communications business to NetScout in 2015, neither the Company nor any “affiliated purchaser” repurchased any shares of Company common stock during 2016, 2015 or 2014. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the 26 million shares of Danaher common stock tendered to and repurchased by the Company in connection with the disposition of the Company’s communications business to NetScout.DividendsThe Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share that was paid on January 27, 2017 to holders of record on December 30, 2016. Aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2016 were $400 million. Dividend payments were higher in 2016 as compared to 2015 as the Company increased its quarterly dividend rate in the first quarter of 2016 to $0.16 per share. Following the Fortive Separation in the third quarter of 2016, the Company reduced its quarterly dividend rate to $0.125 per share.For a description of the dividend of Fortive shares in July 2016, refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Cash and Cash RequirementsAs of December 31, 2016, the Company held $964 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment-grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an approximate weighted average annual interest rate of 0.10%. Of this amount, $316 million was held within the United States and $648 million was held outside of the United States. The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures and acquisitions, pay interest and service debt, pay taxes and any related interest or penalties, fund its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock and support other business needs. The Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, particularly in connection with acquisitions, the Company may also borrow under its commercial paper programs or credit facilities, enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper programs and/or access the capital markets. The Company also may from time to time access the capital markets to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions.While repatriation of some cash held outside the United States may be restricted by local laws, most of the Company’s foreign cash balances could be repatriated to the United States but, under current law, would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. For most of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company makes an election regarding the amount of earnings intended for indefinite reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. The Company has recorded a deferred tax liability for the funds that are available to be repatriated to the United States. No provisions for U.S. income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, and the amount of U.S. income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the Company could employ if it repatriated these earnings. The cash that the Company’s foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments, including acquisitions. As of December 31, 2016, the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely and the basis difference in investments outside of the United States for which deferred taxes have not been provided in aggregate was approximately $23.0 billion. As of December 31, 2016, management believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs, including its cash needs in the United States.During 2016, the Company contributed $58 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans and $44 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2017, the Company’s cash contribution requirements for its U.S. and its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately $35 million and $40 million, respectively. The ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan’s funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates and other factors.49Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 under (1) debt obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company’s balance sheet under GAAP. The amounts presented in the “Other long-term liabilities” line in the table below include $940 million of noncurrent gross unrecognized tax benefits and related interest (and do not include $172 million of current gross unrecognized tax benefits which are included in the “Accrued expenses and other liabilities” line on the Consolidated Balance Sheet). However, the timing of the long-term portion of these liabilities is uncertain, and therefore, they have been included in the “More Than 5 Years” column in the table below. Refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits. Certain of the Company’s acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table below does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts of any such payments are uncertain. Refer to “—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” for a discussion of other contractual obligations that are not reflected in the table below.($ in millions)Total Less ThanOne Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than5 YearsDebt and leases: Debt obligations (a)(b)$12,250.5 $2,591.5 $1,120.3 $5,221.3 $3,317.4Capital lease obligations (b)18.5 3.3 3.3 0.9 11.0Total debt12,269.0 2,594.8 1,123.6 5,222.2 3,328.4Interest payments on debt and capital lease obligations (c)1,237.6 143.8 241.2 183.5 669.1Operating lease obligations (d)741.0 187.0 267.1 149.0 137.9Other: Purchase obligations (e)543.5 492.3 40.3 6.6 4.3Other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company’s balance sheet under GAAP (f)5,670.3 — 729.6 660.8 4,279.9Total$20,461.4 $3,417.9 $2,401.8 $6,222.1 $8,419.6(a) As described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(b) Amounts do not include interest payments.

These future costs are not included in the schedule above.(e) Consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction.(f) Primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies and allowances, performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs, self-insurance and litigation claims, postretirement benefits, pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities and deferred compensation obligations. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management’s estimates over the terms of these arrangements and is largely based upon historical experience.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsGuaranteesThe following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of guarantees of the Company as of December 31, 2016. Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period($ in millions)Total Less ThanOne Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than5 YearsGuarantees$799.0 $707.2 $52.8 $16.9 $22.1Guarantees consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit, bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds. These guarantees have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors, customers, insurance providers, 50Table of Contentsfinancing counterparties and governmental entities to secure the Company’s obligations and/or performance requirements related to specific transactions.Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters or tax matters. In particular, in connection with the 2016 Fortive Separation and the 2015 split-off of the Company’s communications business, Danaher entered into separation and distribution and related agreements pursuant to which Danaher agreed to indemnify the other parties against certain damages and expenses that might occur in the future. These indemnification obligations cover a variety of liabilities, including, but not limited to, employee, tax and environmental matters. The Company has not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they relate to unknown conditions and the Company cannot estimate the potential liabilities from such matters, but the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. In addition, as a result of these divestitures, as well as restructuring activities, certain properties leased by the Company have been sublet to third-parties. In the event any of these third-parties vacate any of these premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by such sub-lessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the Company’s financial statements.In the normal course of business, the Company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers, suppliers or other business partners for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the Company’s products or services or claims alleging that Company products or services infringe third-party intellectual property. The Company has not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual obligations table above. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations.The Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the Company, or by reason of serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to limited exceptions. Danaher’s Amended and Restated By-laws provide for similar indemnification rights. In addition, Danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of Danaher Corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which Danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding. While the Company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage.Legal ProceedingsRefer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies, and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESManagement’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience, the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments.The Company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period-to-period. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Acquired Intangibles—The Company’s business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill, in-process research and development and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the Company may incur. Refer to Notes 1, 2 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s policies relating to goodwill, acquired intangibles and acquisitions.51Table of ContentsIn performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market-based approach. The Company estimates fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the Company’s reporting units, in addition to recent market available sale transactions of comparable businesses. In evaluating the estimates derived by the market-based approach, management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected. In certain circumstances the Company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (i.e., an income approach) in order to validate the results of the market approach. The discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had eight reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment. Management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units decreases as these businesses are integrated into the Company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth. As of the date of the 2016 annual impairment test, the carrying value of the goodwill included in each individual reporting unit ranged from $503 million to approximately $11.7 billion. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2016 indicated that in all instances, the fair values of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 70% to approximately 380%. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this hypothetical 10% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 50% to approximately 330%.The Company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company also tests intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. These analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues, expenses, market conditions and discount rates related to these assets.If actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the Company’s financial statements.Contingent Liabilities—As discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors, including those discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If the reserves established by the Company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s financial statements.Revenue Recognition—The Company derives revenues from the sale of products and services. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s revenue recognition policies. Although most of the Company’s sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, certain agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions. As a result, judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if so, how the consideration should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. The Company allocates revenue to each element in the contractual arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy that, in some instances, may require the Company to estimate the selling price of certain deliverables that are not sold separately or where third-party evidence of pricing is not observable. The Company’s estimate of selling price impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements. The Company also enters into lease 52Table of Contentsarrangements with customers, which requires the Company to determine whether the arrangements are operating or sales-type leases. Certain of the Company’s lease contracts are customized for larger customers and often result in complex terms and conditions that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criteria.If the Company’s judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect, the Company’s reported revenues in particular periods may be adversely affected. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits—For a description of the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit accounting practices, refer to Notes 10 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations, including assumptions regarding discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rates of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. If the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change (as a result of differences in actual experience, changes in key economic indicators or other factors) the Company’s financial statements could be materially affected. A 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the U.S. net obligation by $141 million ($88 million on an after-tax basis) and the non-U.S. net obligation by $140 million ($102 million on an after-tax basis) from the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2016. A 50 basis point increase in the discount rates used for the plans would have decreased the U.S. net obligation by $131 million ($82 million on an after-tax basis) and the non-U.S. net obligation by $140 million ($102 million on an after-tax basis) from the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2016.For 2016, the estimated long-term rate of return for the U.S. plans are 7.0%, and the Company intends to continue to use an assumption of 7.0% for 2017. This expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected long-term returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets. The U.S. plan targets to invest between 60% and 70% of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments. The balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in bond funds. The Company’s non-U.S. plan assets consist of various insurance contracts, equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan. The estimated long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 1.1% to 5.8%. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2016 was reduced by 50 basis points, pension expense for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans for 2016 would have increased $9 million ($6 million on an after-tax basis) and $5 million ($4 million on an after-tax basis), respectively.For a discussion of the Company’s 2016 and anticipated 2017 defined benefit pension plan contributions, refer to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash and Cash Requirements”.Income Taxes—For a description of the Company’s income tax accounting policies, refer to Notes 1 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized which requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding: (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. Future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial statements. The Company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when, based upon the technical merits, it is “more likely than not” that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. Judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions. The Company re-evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances, including when: (1) a tax audit is completed; (2) applicable tax laws change, including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (3) the applicable statute of limitations expires.In addition, certain of the Company’s tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in Denmark (refer to “—Results of Operations – Income Taxes” and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws. However, the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in the Company being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact to the Company’s financial statements, including its effective tax rate.An increase in the Company’s nominal tax rate of 1.0% would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $26 million.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSFor a discussion of the new accounting standards impacting the Company, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.53Table of ContentsITEM 7A.

The Company makes available free of charge on the website its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material with, or furnishing such material to, the SEC. Danaher’s internet site and the information contained on or connected to that site are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, economic conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws, regulations or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.Conditions in the global economy, the markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our business is sensitive to general economic conditions. Slower global economic growth, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt, volatility in the currency and credit markets, high levels of unemployment or underemployment, reduced levels of capital expenditures, changes or anticipation of potential changes in government fiscal, tax, trade and monetary policies, changes in capital requirements for financial institutions, government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics, sequestration, austerity measures and other challenges that affect the global economy adversely affect the Company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, including having the effect of:•reducing demand for our products and services (in this Annual Report, references to products and services also includes software), limiting the financing available to our customers and suppliers, increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies;•increasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories;•increasing price competition in our served markets; •supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; •increasing the risk of impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, and the risk that we may not be able to fully recover the value of other assets such as real estate and tax assets; and•increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which, in addition to increasing the risks identified above, could result in preference actions against us.Although we have been able to access the commercial paper and other capital markets through the date of this report, there can be no assurances that such markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facility will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations.12If growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period, if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve, our business and financial statements could be adversely affected.Our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve, and visibility into our markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies, and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities. Demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in incentive programs, new product introductions and customer inventory levels. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period.We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share. Even if we compete effectively, we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services.Our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. Because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors; refer to “Item 1. Business—Competition” for additional details. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets, including high-growth markets. In addition, significant shifts in industry market share can occur in connection with product problems, safety alerts and publications about products, reflecting the competitive significance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems in our industry. Our failure to compete effectively and/or pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements, and our expansion into new markets may result in greater-than-expected risks, liabilities and expenses.Our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation.We generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis, our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer. Our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to:•correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;•allocate our R&D funding to products and services with higher growth prospects;•anticipate and respond to our competitors’ development of new products and services and technological innovations;•differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings and avoid commoditization;•innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets;•obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies before our competitors do;•successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time;•obtain necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope (including with respect to medical device products by demonstrating satisfactory clinical results where applicable, as well as achieving third-party reimbursement); and•stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies.If we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in R&D of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. 13Even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. In addition, promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, uncertainty over third-party reimbursement or entrenched patterns of clinical practice. Competitors may also develop after-market services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products.Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.Certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. FDA and by comparable agencies of other countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information. Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements.Certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the U.S. FDA, by other federal and state governmental agencies, by comparable agencies of other countries and regions and by regulations governing hazardous materials and drugs-of abuse (or the manufacture and sale of products containing any such materials). We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance (such as 510(k) clearance) or approvals for our new products or modifications to (or additional indications or uses of) existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be time-consuming, costly and subject to restrictions. Our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors, for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results, and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained. Even after initial regulatory clearance or approval, if safety issues arise we may be required to amend conditions for use of a product, such as providing additional warnings on the product’s label or narrowing its approved intended use, which could reduce the product’s market acceptance. Failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products (or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products), other violations of these regulations, real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products (even after obtaining clearance for distribution) and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to FDA Form 483 Inspectional Observations, warning letters, notices to customers, declining sales, loss of customers, loss of market share, recalls, seizures of adulterated or misbranded products, injunctions, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, narrowing of permitted uses for a product, suspension or withdrawal of approvals and pre-market notification rescissions. We are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse, pricing and sales and marketing practices in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information, including the federal regulations described in “Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters.” Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in the adverse effects referenced below under “Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and our business, including our reputation.” Compliance with regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses.14The health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, which could adversely affect our financial statements.The health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, including the following:•many of our customers, and the end-users to whom our customers supply products, rely on government funding of and reimbursement for health care products and services and research activities. The U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “PPACA”), health care austerity measures in other countries and other potential health care reform changes and government austerity measures may reduce the amount of government funding or reimbursement available to customers or end-users of our products and services and/or the volume of medical procedures using our products and services. For example, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, introduced a multi-year pricing program for services payable under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (“CLFS”) that is designed to bring Medicare allowable amounts in line with the amounts paid by private payers. It is unclear whether and to what extent these new rates will affect overall pricing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing services, but if our customers conclude that Medicare reimbursement for these services is inadequate, it could in turn adversely impact the prices at which we sell our products. Other countries also control the price of health care products, directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing or coverage limitations or through compulsory licensing. Global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement.•the PPACA imposes on medical device manufacturers, such as Danaher, a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of certain medical devices. The excise tax has been suspended until the end of 2019, but the Company would be subject to the tax beginning in 2020.•governmental and private health care providers and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the delivery of health care services, forming group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks and pursuing consolidation to improve their purchasing leverage and using competitive bid processes to procure health care products and services.These changes as well as other impacts from market demand, government regulations, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures have increased our tax liabilities and may cause participants in the health care industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services, reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products and services from governmental agencies or third-party payors, reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services, affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products and increase our compliance and other costs. In addition, we may be unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us, and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability. All of the factors described above could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price.Our ability to grow revenues, earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies. We may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price. Promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including high valuations, competition among prospective buyers, the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms. In addition, competition for acquisitions may result in higher purchase prices. Changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions.15Our acquisition of businesses, investments, joint ventures and strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements.As part of our business strategy we acquire businesses, make investments and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course, and we also from time to time complete more significant transactions; refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) for additional details. Acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our business and our financial statements:•any business, technology, service or product that we acquire or invest in could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable, or we could fail to make any such business profitable.•we may incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships, which could also cause a deterioration of Danaher’s credit ratings, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense and diminish our future access to the capital markets.•acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations in any given period, or over the long-term.•pre-closing and post-closing earnings charges could adversely impact operating results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period-to-period.•acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships could create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address.•we could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other controls and systems and retaining key employees and customers.•we may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition, investment, joint venture or strategic relationship.•we may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company’s or investee’s activities and the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations.•in connection with acquisitions and joint ventures, we often enter into post-closing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments, earn-out obligations and indemnification obligations, which may have unpredictable financial results.•as a result of our acquisitions and investments, we have recorded significant goodwill and other assets on our balance sheet and if we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur impairment charges.•we may have interests that diverge from those of our joint venture partners or other strategic partners and we may not be able to direct the management and operations of the joint venture or other strategic relationship in the manner we believe is most appropriate, exposing us to additional risk.•investing in or making loans to early-stage companies often entails a high degree of risk, and we may not achieve the strategic, technological, financial or commercial benefits we anticipate; we may lose our investment or fail to recoup our loan; or our investment may be illiquid for a greater-than-expected period of time.The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements.16Divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements.We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest, spin-off, split-off or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. For example, we split-off our communications business in 2015 and spun-off our Fortive business in 2016. Transactions such as these pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements. For example, when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not become satisfied. In addition, divestitures or other dispositions may dilute the Company’s earnings per share, have other adverse financial and accounting impacts and distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. In addition, we have retained responsibility for and/or have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold or disposed. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.We could incur significant liability if the 2016 spin-off of Fortive Corporation (“Fortive”) or the 2015 split-off of our communications business is determined to be a taxable transaction.In July 2015, the Company consummated the split-off of the majority of its former communications business to Danaher shareholders who elected to exchange Danaher shares for ownership interests in the communications business, and the subsequent merger of the communications business with a subsidiary of NetScout. Danaher shareholders who participated in the exchange offer tendered 26 million shares of Danaher common stock (approximately $2.3 billion on the date of tender) and received 62.5 million shares of NetScout common stock which represented approximately 60% of the shares of NetScout common stock outstanding following the combination.On July 2, 2016, Danaher completed the separation (the “Separation”) of its former Test & Measurement segment, Industrial Technologies segment (excluding the product identification businesses) and retail/commercial petroleum business by distributing to Danaher stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Fortive, the entity Danaher incorporated to hold such businesses. To effect the Separation, Danaher distributed to its stockholders one share of Fortive common stock for every two shares of Danaher common stock outstanding as of June 15, 2016, the record date for the distribution.We have received opinions from outside tax counsel to the effect that each of the Fortive Separation in 2016 and the split-off of our communications business in 2015 qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code. These opinions rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, our stockholders and we may not be able to rely on the respective opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) could determine on audit that either or both separations are taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the respective opinion. If either transaction is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.Potential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the 2016 spin-off of Fortive and the 2015 split-off of our communications business could materially and adversely affect our business and financial statements.We entered into a separation and distribution agreement and related agreements with Fortive to govern the Separation and the relationship between the two companies going forward. We entered into similar agreements with NetScout Systems, Inc. in connection with the split-off of our communications business. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party and could lead to disputes between us. If we are required to indemnify the other parties under the circumstances set forth in these agreements, we may be subject to substantial liabilities. In addition, with respect to the liabilities for which the other parties have agreed to indemnify us under these agreements, there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against such other parties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of the liabilities, or that such other parties will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. It is also possible that a court could disregard the allocation of assets and liabilities agreed to between Danaher and such other parties and require Danaher to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to such other parties. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business and financial statements.17A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers, other business partners and patients), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as receiving and fulfilling orders, billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations). In addition, some of our remote monitoring products and services incorporate software and information technology that may house personal data and some products or software we sell to customers may connect to our systems for maintenance or other purposes. These systems, products and services may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, human error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Attacks may also target hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. Security breaches of systems provided or enabled by us, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services, could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers. Like most multinational corporations, our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. Unauthorized tampering, adulteration or interference with our products may also adversely affect product functionality and result in loss of data, risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions. Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.If we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches, we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences. As a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. For example, in the United States, HIPAA privacy and security rules require certain of our operations to maintain controls to protect the availability and confidentiality of patient health information, individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy. European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe, and the new EU General Data Protection Regulation, which takes effect in May 2018, will impose significantly stricter requirements in how we collect and process personal data. Several countries, such as China and Russia, have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.Our operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.Our operations, products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment, establish standards for the use, generation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and impose end-of-life disposal and take-back programs. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the United States and abroad in connection with our operations. We cannot assure you that our environmental, health and safety compliance program (or the compliance programs of businesses we acquire) have been or will at all times be effective. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements.In addition, we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury, property damage or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury or damage due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. We may also become subject to additional remedial, compliance or personal injury costs due to future 18events such as changes in existing laws or regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules. For additional information regarding these risks, refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. We cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. However, based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2017 will have a material effect on our financial statements.Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and our business, including our reputation.In addition to the environmental, health, safety, health care, medical device, anticorruption, data privacy and other regulations noted elsewhere in this Annual Report, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional levels, including the following:•we are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons and dealings between our employees and between our subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory.•we also have agreements to sell products and services to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with government entities. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. Our agreements with government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification at the convenience of the government or in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors, and we may underestimate our costs of performing under the contract. In certain cases, a governmental entity may require us to pay back amounts it has paid to us. Government contracts that have been awarded to us following a bid process could become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder, which could result in loss of the contract. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts. These are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. The regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. We, our representatives and the industries in which we operate may at times be under review and/or investigation by regulatory authorities. Failure to comply (or any alleged or perceived failure to comply) with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and nonmonetary penalties, and any such failure or alleged failure (or becoming subject to a regulatory enforcement investigation) could also damage our reputation, disrupt our business, limit our ability to manufacture, import, export and sell products and services, result in loss of customers and disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. Compliance with these and other regulations may also affect our returns on investment, require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our business. Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the International Standards Organization, and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our business and financial statements. For additional information regarding these risks, refer to “Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters.”Our restructuring actions could have long-term adverse effects on our business.In recent years, we have implemented significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. These restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities (including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses) reduce our available talent, assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers, limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases and trigger adverse public attention. In addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements, unexpected costs or 19failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize from such actions. Any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements.We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.As of December 31, 2017, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $36.8 billion. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets, changes in the structure of our business, divestitures, market capitalization declines, or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized.Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements.Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products and services we purchase overseas. Sales and expenses of our non-U.S. businesses are also translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects. In addition, certain of our businesses may invoice customers in a currency other than the business’ functional currency, and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable translation effects. The Company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries.Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was enacted. The TCJA significantly revises the U.S. federal corporate income tax law by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate to 21% (beginning in 2018), implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time tax on unremitted cumulative non-U.S. earnings of foreign subsidiaries (“Transition Tax”). The U.S. Treasury Department and IRS have not yet issued regulations with respect to the TCJA.Due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the TCJA), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our intercompany arrangements, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, our estimates of effective tax rate and income tax assets and liabilities may be incorrect and our financial statements could be adversely affected; please refer to MD&A for a discussion of additional factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period. For example, our estimate of the net one-time charge we have incurred related to the TCJA could differ materially from our actual liability, due to, among other things, further refinement of our calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions that we have made, additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and IRS, and actions we may take as a result of the TCJA. The impact of the factors referenced in the first sentence of this paragraph may be substantially different from period-to-period. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities, such as the audits described in MD&A and the Company’s financial statements. If audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected. Any further significant changes to the tax system in the United States or in other jurisdictions (including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below) could adversely affect our financial statements.Changes in tax law relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect our tax position.The U.S. Congress, government agencies in non-U.S. jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting,” where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in low-tax jurisdictions, or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. The OECD has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for addressing base erosion and profit shifting. As a result, the tax laws in the United States 20and other countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect our business and financial statements.We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our business and financial statements.We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims or counterclaims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiture-related matters, as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement. We may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, divested businesses. The types of claims made in lawsuits include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages (and in some cases, treble damages) and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. In addition, developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. We cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and business. However, based on our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2017 will have a material effect on our financial statements.If we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third-parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our business. The intellectual property rights that we obtain, however, may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. In addition, the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented, designed-around or becoming subject to compulsory licensing, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons, or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third-parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business, including our competitive position, and financial statements.Third-parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.From time to time, we receive notices from third-parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. Any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to critical technology, be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services, be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our business, including our competitive position, and financial statements. Even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.21The U.S. government has certain rights to use and disclose some of the intellectual property that we license and could exclusively license it to a third-party if we fail to achieve practical application of the intellectual property.Certain technology licensed by us under agreements with third-party licensors may be subject to government rights. Government rights in inventions conceived or reduced to practice under a government-funded program may include a nonexclusive, royalty-free worldwide license to practice or have practiced such inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the U.S. government has the right to require us or our licensors (as applicable) to grant licenses which would be exclusive under any of such inventions to a third-party if they determine that: (1) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize such inventions in a particular field of use; (2) such action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (3) such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations. Further, the government rights include the right to use and disclose, without limitation, technical data relating to licensed technology that was developed in whole or in part at government expense.Defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products or services (including software), or allegations thereof, could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.Manufacturing or design defects or “bugs” in, unanticipated use of, safety or quality issues (or the perception of such issues) with respect to, “off label” use of, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell (including items that we source from third-parties) can lead to personal injury, death, property damage, loss of profits or other liability. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts, result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us. Recalls, removals and product liability and similar claims (regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome) can result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. Our business can also be affected by studies of the utilization, safety and efficacy of medical device products and components that are conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. Any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of product issues.The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products, our reputation, business and financial statements could suffer.The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters and environmental factors, and if not discovered before the product is released to market could result in recalls and product liability exposure. Because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities and other stringent regulations of the FDA and similar agencies regarding the manufacture of certain of our products, an alternative manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity. Any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant costs, liability and lost revenue, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products.Our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow, and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements.As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $10.5 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we had the ability to incur an additional $1.6 billion of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facility based on the amounts available under the Company’s $4.0 billion credit facility which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances. Our debt level and related debt service obligations can have negative consequences, including (1) requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and capital investment; (2) reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and (3) exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. We may incur significantly more debt in the future, particularly to finance acquisitions, and there can be no assurance that our cost of funding will not substantially increase.Our current revolving credit facility and long-term debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us; for more information refer to MD&A. If we breach any of these restrictions and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements. In addition, any failure to maintain the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies would adversely affect our cost of funds and could adversely affect our liquidity and access to the capital markets. If we add new debt, the risks described above could increase.22Adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition, performance, purchasing patterns or inventory levels of, key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements.Certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to or through key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and end-users. Some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products or compete with us directly, and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. Adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners, reduction or discontinuation of their purchases from us or adverse developments in their financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns, could adversely affect our business and financial statements. The levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners, and changes in those levels, can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period. In addition, the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries could adversely impact our business and financial statements.Certain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other third-parties for development, supply and marketing of certain products and potential products, and such collaborative partners or other third-parties could fail to perform sufficiently.We believe that for certain of our businesses, success in penetrating target markets depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies. Relying on collaborative relationships is risky because, among other things, our collaborative partners may (1) not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations; (2) fail to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner; (3) be acquired by other companies and terminate our collaborative partnership or become insolvent; (4) compete with us; (5) disagree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship; (6) have insufficient capital resources; and (7) decline to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms. Because these and other factors may be beyond our control, the development or commercialization of our products involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. If we or any of our collaborative partners terminate a collaborative arrangement, we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or we may need to cancel some development programs, which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations.As discussed in “Item 1. Business—Materials,” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components, raw materials and other commodities. Prices for and availability of these components, raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past. Any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business. In addition, due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve, the cost-containment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to, if commodity prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions, or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs, our margins and profitability could decline and our financial statements could be adversely affected.If we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand, our profitability may suffer. In addition, our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials, components and services could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies.We purchase materials, components and equipment from third-parties for use in our manufacturing operations. Our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations, including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality. During a market upturn, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices. If we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand, we may not be able to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed, our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities. Conversely, in order to secure supplies for the production of products, we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer.In addition, some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, regulatory requirements, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. If these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons, decreased availability of key raw materials or 23commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, war, terrorist actions, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes. Any of these factors could result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies.Because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements. Any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our financial statements.Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses.We compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional regulations, such as regulations governing health and safety, the environment, food and drugs, privacy and electronic communications. We develop, configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. Any significant change in any of these regulations (or in the interpretation or application thereof) could reduce demand for, increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services, or could restrict our existing activities, products and services. For example, a number of our products and services are marketed to the pharmaceutical and related industries for use in discovering and developing drugs and therapies. Changes in the U.S. FDA’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products and services. In addition, in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations. In these markets, the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations, the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address or the repeal of existing regulations, could adversely affect demand. In addition, regulatory deadlines may result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period-to-period.Work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations.We have a number of U.S. collective bargaining units and various non-U.S. collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our financial statements and business, including our productivity and reputation.International economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements.In 2017, approximately 63% of our sales were derived from customers outside the United States. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located outside the United States. Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the United States and increase the localization of our products and services, we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the United States, particularly in the high-growth markets. Our international business (and particularly our business in high-growth markets) is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations, including:•interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers; •differences in terms of sale, including payment terms;•local product preferences and product requirements;•changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, such as the devaluation of particular currencies;•trade protection measures, embargoes and import or export restrictions and requirements;•unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws;•capital controls and limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash;•the potential for nationalization of enterprises;•changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs;•limitations on legal rights and our ability to enforce such rights;•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;24•differing labor regulations;•difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis; and•differing protection of intellectual property.Any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and business, including our growth rate.Significant developments stemming from the current U.S. administration or the United Kingdom’s referendum on membership in the EU could have an adverse effect on us.Changes, potential changes or uncertainties in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing the health care system and drug prices, foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate, stemming from the current U.S. administration, could adversely affect our business and financial statements. For example, the current U.S. administration has called for substantial changes to trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”), has increased tariffs on certain goods imported into the United States and has raised the possibility of imposing significant, additional tariff increases.Additionally, on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum and voted in favor of leaving the EU. This referendum has caused and may continue to cause political and economic uncertainty, including significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Although it is unknown what the full terms of the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the EU will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and other countries, including the United States, and increased regulatory complexities. Any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial statements.If we suffer loss to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed.Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, public health crisis, war, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. If any of these facilities, supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses. The third-party insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against such losses.Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements.The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets, investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements. In addition, upward pressure on the cost of providing health care coverage to current employees and retirees may increase our future funding obligations and adversely affect our financial statements.ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNot applicable.ITEM 2. PROPERTIESDanaher’s corporate headquarters are located in Washington, D.C. in a facility that the Company leases. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had facilities in over 60 countries, including approximately 248 significant manufacturing and distribution facilities. 111 of these facilities are located in the United States in over 25 states and 137 are located outside the United States in over 31 other countries, primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia, the rest of North America, South America and Australia. These facilities cover approximately 22 million square feet, of which approximately 11 million square feet are owned and approximately 11 million square feet are leased. Particularly outside the United States, facilities often serve more than one business segment and may be used for multiple purposes, such as administration, sales, manufacturing, warehousing and/or distribution. The number of significant manufacturing and distribution facilities by business segment is:•Life Sciences, 76;•Diagnostics, 77;25•Dental, 43; and•Environmental & Applied Solutions, 52.The Company considers its facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used and does not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. The Company believes its properties and equipment have been well-maintained. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information with respect to the Company’s lease commitments.ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGSIn September 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued a Notice of Violation to the Richmond, Illinois facility of Leica Biosystems Richmond, Inc. (“Leica Biosystems”), an indirect subsidiary of the Company, alleging that the facility violated certain provisions of the Clean Air Act and related regulations pertaining to permitting requirements, emissions limitations and the installation and use of proper controls. In December 2017, Leica Biosystems and the EPA reached an agreement in principle on an agency administrative settlement whereby all of Leica Biosystems’ alleged violations would be settled for a payment of approximately $175,000 and certain injunctive relief. The parties expect to reflect the terms of the agreement in principle in an administrative order to be negotiated. The Company does not believe that the final resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.For additional information regarding legal proceedings, refer to the section titled “Legal Proceedings” in MD&A.ITEM 4.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide a reader of Danaher’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of Company management. The Company’s MD&A is divided into five sections:•Overview•Results of Operations•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Critical Accounting Estimates•New Accounting StandardsThis discussion and analysis should be read along with Danaher’s audited financial statements and related Notes thereto as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 included in this Annual Report.OVERVIEWGeneralRefer to “Item 1. Business—General” for a discussion of Danaher’s strategic objectives and methodologies for delivering long-term shareholder value. Danaher is a multinational business with global operations. During 2017, approximately 63% of Danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the United States. As a diversified, global business, Danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors. Danaher’s geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of its products, software and services, help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. Given the broad range of products manufactured, software and services provided and geographies served, management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the Company. The Company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.As a result of the Company’s geographic and industry diversity, the Company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges, including rapid technological development (particularly with respect to computing, automation, artificial intelligence, mobile connectivity, communications and digitization) in most of the Company’s served markets, the expansion and evolution of opportunities in high-growth markets, trends and costs associated with a global labor force, consolidation of the Company’s competitors and increasing regulation. The Company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and the Company’s long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in high-growth geographies and high-growth market segments, identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative and differentiated new products and services with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of the Company’s sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated global environment. The Company is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources (particularly in high-growth markets) in order to be responsive to the Company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the Company’s operations.Business PerformanceConsolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 8.5% as compared to 2016. While differences exist among the Company’s businesses, on an overall basis, demand for the Company’s products and services increased on a year-over-year basis in 2017 as compared to 2016. This demand, together with the Company’s continued investments in sales growth initiatives and the other business-specific factors discussed below, contributed to year-over-year core sales growth of 3.5% (for the definition of “core sales,” refer to “—Results of Operations” below). Geographically, both high-growth and developed markets contributed to year-over-year core sales growth during 2017. The Company defines high-growth markets as developing markets of the world experiencing rapid growth in gross domestic product and infrastructure which includes Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia (with the exception of Japan and Australia). Core sales growth rates in high-growth markets grew at a high-single digit rate in 2017 as compared to 2016 led by strength in China, India, Eastern Europe and Latin America, partially offset by weakness in the Middle East. High-growth markets represented 30Table of Contentsapproximately 30% of the Company’s total sales in 2017. Core sales in developed markets grew at a low-single digit rate in 2017 as compared to 2016 and were driven by North America and Western Europe.The Company’s income from continuing operations for the year-ended December 31, 2017 totaled approximately $2.5 billion, or $3.50 per diluted share, compared to approximately $2.2 billion, or $3.08 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016.During 2017, the Company made the strategic decision to discontinue a molecular diagnostic product line in its Diagnostics segment. As a result, the Company recorded $76 million of pretax restructuring, impairment and other related charges ($51 million after-tax or $0.07 per diluted share). These charges included $49 million of noncash charges for the impairment of certain technology-related intangible assets as well as related inventory and property, plant and equipment with no further use. In addition, the Company incurred $27 million of cash restructuring costs primarily related to employee severance and related charges. Substantially all restructuring activities related to this discontinued product line were completed in 2017.AcquisitionsDuring 2017, the Company acquired ten businesses for total consideration of $386 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of the Company’s Life Sciences, Dental and Environmental & Applied Solutions segments. The aggregate annual sales of these ten businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $160 million. For a discussion of the Company’s 2016 and 2015 acquisition and disposition activity, refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Investing Activities”.Fortive SeparationOn July 2, 2016, Danaher completed the Separation of its former Test & Measurement segment, Industrial Technologies segment (excluding the product identification businesses) and retail/commercial petroleum business by distributing to Danaher stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Fortive, the entity Danaher incorporated to hold such businesses. To effect the Separation, Danaher distributed to its stockholders one share of Fortive common stock for every two shares of Danaher common stock outstanding as of June 15, 2016, the record date for the distribution.During the second quarter of 2016, the Company received net cash distributions of approximately $3.0 billion from Fortive as consideration for the Company’s contribution of assets to Fortive in connection with the Separation (“Fortive Distribution”). Danaher used a portion of the cash distribution proceeds to repay the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.3% senior unsecured notes that matured in June 2016 and to redeem approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness in August 2016 (consisting of the Company’s 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2018, 5.4% senior unsecured notes due 2019 and 3.9% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (collectively the “Redeemed Notes”)). Danaher also paid an aggregate of $188 million in make-whole premiums in connection with the August 2016 redemptions, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company used the balance of the Fortive Distribution to fund certain of the Company’s regular, quarterly cash dividends to shareholders. The accounting requirements for reporting the Separation of Fortive as a discontinued operation were met when the Separation was completed. Accordingly, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented reflect this business as a discontinued operation. The Company allocated a portion of the consolidated interest expense and income to discontinued operations based on the ratio of the discontinued business’ net assets to the Company’s consolidated net assets. Fortive had revenues of approximately $3.0 billion in 2016 prior to the Separation and approximately $6.2 billion in 2015. As a result of the Separation, the Company incurred $48 million in Separation-related costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 which are included in earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Earnings. These Separation costs primarily relate to professional fees associated with preparation of regulatory filings and Separation activities within finance, tax, legal and information system functions as well as certain investment banking fees incurred upon the Separation. In 2017, Danaher recorded a $22 million income tax benefit related to the release of previously provided reserves associated with uncertain tax positions on certain Danaher tax returns which were jointly filed with Fortive entities. These reserves were released due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for those returns. All Fortive entity-related balances were included in the income tax benefit related to discontinued operations.31Table of ContentsSale of InvestmentsThe Company received $138 million of cash proceeds and recorded $22 million in short-term other receivables from the sale of certain marketable equity securities during 2017. The Company recorded a pretax gain related to this sale of $73 million ($46 million after-tax or $0.06 per diluted share).For a discussion of the Company’s 2016 and 2015 sales of investments activity, refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Investing Activities”.U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs ActOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted, which substantially changes the U.S. tax system, including lowering the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% (beginning in 2018), and affected the Company in a number of ways. As a result of the TCJA, the Company recognized a provisional tax liability of approximately $1.2 billion in 2017 for the Transition Tax, which is payable over a period of eight years. The Company also remeasured U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the income tax rates at which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to reverse in the future (generally 21%), resulting in an income tax benefit of approximately $1.2 billion. After considering the effect of the TCJA, the Company expects its 2018 effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21%. The Company does not expect the Transition Tax to significantly impact the Company’s cash flows from operations due to the payment period of eight years and the Company’s ability to use available credits to reduce the required payments. For further discussion of the TCJA, refer to “—Income Taxes.”RESULTS OF OPERATIONSIn this report, references to the non-GAAP measure of core sales (also referred to as core revenues or sales from existing businesses) refer to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) but excluding:•sales from acquired businesses; and•the impact of currency translation.References to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales and operating profit, as applicable, attributable to divested product lines not considered discontinued operations. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between:•the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses); and•the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period.Core sales growth should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting the non-GAAP financial measure of core sales growth provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in Danaher’s business and facilitating comparisons of Danaher’s revenue performance with its performance in prior and future periods and to Danaher’s peers. Management also uses core sales growth to measure the Company’s operating and financial performance. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from core sales because currency translation is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestiture-related items because the nature, size, timing and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period-to-period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.Throughout this discussion, references to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales and references to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies resulting from the ongoing application of DBS.32Table of ContentsRevenue Performance 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015Total sales growth (GAAP)8.5 %17.0 %Less the impact of: Acquisitions and other(4.5)% (15.0)%Currency exchange rates (0.5)% 1.0 %Core revenue growth (non-GAAP)3.5 % 3.0 %Core sales grew on a year-over-year basis in both 2017 and 2016. Sales from acquired businesses increased on a year-over-year basis in both years primarily due to the acquisitions of Cepheid in the fourth quarter of 2016 and Pall in the third quarter of 2015. Currency translation increased reported sales on a year-over-year basis in 2017 primarily due to the U.S. dollar weakening against the euro, partially offset by the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi. Currency translation reduced reported sales on a year-over-year basis in 2016 as the U.S. dollar was, on average, stronger against other major currencies. Operating profit margins were 16.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 16.3% in 2016. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.2017 vs. 2016 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by: •Higher 2017 sales volumes from existing businesses and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2017 and 2016, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments - 70 basis points•Acquisition-related charges in 2016 - 50 basis points2017 vs. 2016 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:•Restructuring, impairment and other related charges related to discontinuing a product line in the second quarter of 2017 related to the Diagnostic segment - 40 basis points •Trade name impairments and related productivity improvement initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the Dental segment - 5 basis points •Third quarter 2016 gain on resolution of acquisition-related matters less the impact of fourth quarter 2017 net gain on resolution of acquisition-related matters - 5 basis points•The incremental net dilutive effect in 2017 of acquired businesses - 50 basis pointsOperating profit margins were 16.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 15.0% in 2015.

This growth was partially offset by continuing declines in demand in the clinical market in North America. Core sales of microscopy products increased on a year-over-year basis with growth in demand across most end-markets particularly in Western Europe and the high-growth markets. Year-over-year sales for the business’ flow cytometry and particle counting products grew in 2017, primarily due to new product introductions and were led by increases in sales in North America, Western Europe and China. Core sales for filtration, separation and purification technologies grew on a year-over-year basis led by continued growth in biopharmaceuticals and microelectronics, partially offset by declines in the process, industrial and medical products particularly in the first half of 2017. Geographically, core sales in filtration, separation and purification technologies were primarily led by growth in North America and Asia, partially offset by declines in the Middle East largely due to a major project in 2016 which did not repeat in 2017.Operating profit margins increased 230 basis points during 2017 as compared to 2016. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.2017 vs. 2016 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:•Higher 2017 sales volumes from existing businesses and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2017 and 2016, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various new product development, sales and marketing growth investments and the effect of year-over-year changes in currency exchange rates - 205 basis points•Acquisition-related charges in 2016, including transaction costs deemed significant, change in control and restructuring payments, and fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue - 10 basis points•The incremental net accretive effect in 2017 of acquired businesses and intersegment product line transfers - 20 basis points2017 vs. 2016 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:•Fourth quarter 2017 loss on resolution of acquisition-related matters - 5 basis points2016 Compared to 2015 Price increases in the segment did not have a significant impact on sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2016 as compared with 2015.Core sales of the business’ broad range of mass spectrometers continued to grow on a year-over-year basis led by strong core sales growth in the pharmaceutical market in China and India as well as the services businesses. This growth was partially offset by declines in the overall market in Japan and softness in demand in the clinical end-market in North America. Core sales of microscopy products were essentially flat on a year-over-year basis with growth in demand in North America and China offset by declines in Japan. Year-over-year demand for the business’ flow cytometry and particle counting products grew in 2016, led by increases in demand in North America, Western Europe and China.The acquisition of Pall in August 2015 contributed the majority of the increase in sales from acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Pall’s revenues grew on a year-over-year basis compared to the business’ 2015 results, led by continued growth in the life sciences business primarily due to demand for biopharmaceutical solutions including single-use technologies, partially offset by soft demand in the industrial business as a result of overall market weakness.Operating profit margins increased 540 basis points during 2016 as compared to 2015. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. 2016 vs. 2015 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:•Higher 2016 sales volumes from existing businesses and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2016 and 2015, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments and the effect of a stronger U.S. dollar in 2016 - 175 basis points35Table of Contents•Acquisition-related charges in 2015 associated with the acquisition of Pall, including transaction costs deemed significant, change in control payments, and fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue, net of the positive impact of freezing pension benefits - 390 basis points2016 vs. 2015 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:•Acquisition-related charges in 2016, including transaction costs deemed significant, change in control and restructuring payments, and fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue - 10 basis points•The incremental net dilutive effect in 2016 of acquired businesses (including Pall) - 15 basis pointsDepreciation and amortization expense increased during 2016 as compared to 2015 due primarily to the impact of recently acquired businesses, particularly Pall, and the resulting increase in depreciable and amortizable assets.DIAGNOSTICSThe Company’s Diagnostics segment offers analytical instruments, reagents, consumables, software and services that hospitals, physicians’ offices, reference laboratories and other critical care settings use to diagnose disease and make treatment decisions.

Geographically, continued strong demand in high-growth markets for the clinical lab business was partially offset by declines in Western Europe and Japan. Increased demand in the immunoassay product line drove the majority of the growth for the year in the clinical lab business. Growth in the acute care diagnostic business was driven by continued strong consumable sales in 2017 across most major geographies. Increased demand for advanced staining and core histology instruments and related consumables across most major geographies drove the majority of the year-over-year core sales growth in the pathology diagnostics business.The acquisition of Cepheid in November 2016 contributed the majority of the increase in sales from acquisitions. During 2017, Cepheid’s revenues compared to the business’ 2016 results grew on a year-over-year basis in most major geographies and product lines. As Cepheid is integrated into the Company, a process that will continue over the next several years, the Company has realized and expects to realize cost savings and other business process improvements through the application of DBS. 36Table of ContentsDuring 2017, the Company made the strategic decision to discontinue a molecular diagnostic product line in its Diagnostics segment. As a result, the Company recorded $76 million of pretax restructuring, impairment and other related charges ($51 million after-tax or $0.07 per diluted share). These charges included $49 million of noncash charges for the impairment of certain technology-related intangible assets as well as related inventory and property, plant and equipment with no further use. In addition, the Company incurred $27 million of cash restructuring costs primarily related to employee severance and related charges. Substantially all restructuring activities related to this discontinued product line were completed in 2017.Operating profit margins declined 70 basis points during 2017 as compared to 2016.

Strong year-over-year growth continued during 2017 for the specialty consumables business, which consists of implant solutions and orthodontic products. Core sales growth for the specialty consumables business was led by high-growth markets and North America. Dental equipment core sales were essentially flat during 2017, as increased demand in high-growth markets was offset by weaker demand in the United States and Western Europe, particularly later in the year for North America due to the realignment of dental equipment distributors and manufacturers. Demand was lower for traditional dental consumable product lines in North America and Western Europe reflecting inventory destocking by several distribution partners. While the impact of inventory destocking in the consumables business began to lessen late in 2017, the recent realignment of distributors and manufacturers in the dental industry, primarily in North America, may have a continued negative impact on revenues in the near-term.Operating profit margins declined 80 basis points during 2017 as compared to 2016.

The following factors unfavorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.•The incremental net dilutive effect in 2016 of acquired businesses - 75 basis points•Incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments and the effect of a stronger U.S. dollar in 2016, net of higher 2016 sales volumes from existing businesses and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2016 and 2015 - 5 basis pointsCOST OF SALES AND GROSS PROFIT For the Year Ended December 31($ in millions)2017 2016 2015Sales$18,329.7 $16,882.4 $14,433.7Cost of sales(8,137.2) (7,547.8) (6,662.6)Gross profit$10,192.5 $9,334.6 $7,771.1Gross profit margin55.6% 55.3% 53.8%The year-over-year increase in cost of sales during 2017 as compared with 2016 is due primarily to the impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, including sales from recently acquired businesses and the impact of restructuring, impairment and other related charges associated with the Company’s strategic decision to discontinue a product line in its Diagnostics segment. This increase in cost of sales was partially offset by year-over-year cost savings at recently acquired businesses, incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continued productivity improvement actions taken in 2017 and 2016, and the year-over-year decrease in acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory which decreased cost of sales by $21 million during 2017 as compared to 2016.The year-over-year increase in cost of sales during 2016 as compared with 2015, is due primarily to the impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, including sales from recently acquired businesses. This increase in cost of sales was partially offset by year-over-year cost savings at recently acquired businesses, particularly Pall, incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continued productivity improvement actions taken in 2016 and 2015, and the year-over-year decrease in acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory which decreased cost of sales by $85 million during 2016 as compared to 2015.The year-over-year increase in gross profit margins during 2017 as compared with 2016 is due primarily to the favorable impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continuing productivity improvements taken in 2017 and 2016. In addition, the acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue were higher in 2016 than 2017, which improved gross profit margins by 10 basis points during 2017 as compared with 2016.The year-over-year increase in gross profit margins during 2016 as compared with 2015 is due primarily to the favorable impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continuing productivity improvements taken in 2016 and 2015 and improved gross profit margins on a year-over-year basis at recently acquired businesses, particularly Pall. In addition, the acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue were higher in 2015 than 2016, which improved gross profit margins by 50 basis points during 2016 as compared with 2015.41Table of ContentsOPERATING EXPENSES For the Year Ended December 31($ in millions)2017 2016 2015Sales$18,329.7 $16,882.4 $14,433.7Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses(6,042.5) (5,608.6) (4,747.5)Research and development (“R&D”) expenses(1,128.8) (975.1) (861.4)SG&A as a % of sales33.0% 33.2% 32.9%R&D as a % of sales6.2% 5.8% 6.0%SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales declined 20 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2017 compared with 2016. The decline was driven by increased leverage of the Company’s general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2017 sales volumes, continuing productivity improvements taken in 2017 and 2016 as well as the benefit of lower acquisition charges in 2017 compared to 2016, particularly change in control payments and restructuring costs in connection with the acquisition of Cepheid. The decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales was partially offset by restructuring, impairment and other related charges associated with the Company’s strategic decision to discontinue a product line in its Diagnostics segment, higher relative spending levels at recently acquired companies, primarily Cepheid, and continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales increased 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2016 compared with 2015. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales from 2015 to 2016 was driven by continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives and higher relative spending levels at recently acquired businesses. Change in control payments and restructuring costs in connection with the acquisition of Cepheid, as well as associated transaction costs, also increased SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales by 35 basis points during 2016. These increases were partially offset by the benefit of increased leverage of the Company’s general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2016 sales, lower year-over-year costs associated continuing productivity improvement initiatives and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continuing productivity improvements taken in 2016 and 2015 as well as the benefit of lower Pall acquisition charges (change in control payments to Pall employees in connection with the acquisition of Pall, as well as associated transaction costs and amortization charges associated with acquisition-related intangible assets, net of the positive impact of freezing pension benefits) in 2016 compared to 2015.R&D expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) as a percentage of sales increased in 2017 as compared with 2016 due primarily to higher R&D expenses as a percentage of sales in the businesses most recently acquired, primarily Cepheid, as well as year-over-year increases in spending in the Company’s new product development initiatives. R&D expenses as a percentage of sales declined in 2016 as compared to 2015 due primarily to lower R&D expenses as a percentage of sales in the businesses most recently acquired, particularly Pall, as well as year-over-year differences in the timing of investments in the Company’s new product development initiatives.NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) The Company received $138 million of cash proceeds and recorded $22 million in short-term other receivables from the sale of certain marketable equity securities during 2017. The Company recorded a pretax gain related to this sale of $73 million ($46 million after-tax or $0.06 per diluted share).During 2016, the Company received cash proceeds of $265 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and recorded a pretax gain related to this sale of $223 million ($140 million after-tax or $0.20 per diluted share). During 2016, the Company also paid $188 million of make-whole premiums associated with the early extinguishment of the Redeemed Notes. The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of these borrowings, net of certain deferred gains, of $179 million ($112 million after-tax or $0.16 per diluted share). During 2015, the Company received cash proceeds of $43 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and recorded a pretax gain related to these sales of $12 million ($8 million after-tax or $0.01 per diluted share). INTEREST COSTSInterest expense of $163 million for 2017 was $22 million lower than in 2016, due primarily to the decrease in interest costs as a result of the early extinguishment of certain outstanding borrowings in the third quarter of 2016 using the proceeds from the Fortive Distribution and due to lower commercial paper borrowings in 2017 compared to 2016, partially offset by the cost of 42Table of Contentsadditional long-term debt refinancing relating to the acquisition of Cepheid. For a further description of the Company’s debt as of December 31, 2017 refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest expense of $184 million in 2016 was $45 million higher than the 2015 interest expense of $140 million due primarily to the higher interest costs associated with the debt issued in the second half of 2015 in connection with the 2015 acquisition of Pall, partially offset by decreases in interest costs as a result of the early extinguishment of the Redeemed Notes in the third quarter of 2016 using the proceeds from the Fortive Distribution.INCOME TAXESGeneralIncome tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.The Company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws and regulations, including the TCJA and legislative policy changes that may result from the OECD’s initiative on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. For a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, refer to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash and Cash Requirements” below.The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis. Based on these reviews, the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities, tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations, reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary. For a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted, substantially changing the U.S. tax system and affecting the Company in a number of ways. Notably, the TCJA: •establishes a flat corporate income tax rate of 21.0% on U.S. earnings; •imposes a one-time tax on unremitted cumulative non-U.S. earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which we refer to in this Annual Report as the Transition Tax; •imposes a new minimum tax on certain non-U.S. earnings, irrespective of the territorial system of taxation, and generally allows for the repatriation of future earnings of foreign subsidiaries without incurring additional U.S. taxes by transitioning to a territorial system of taxation; •subjects certain payments made by a U.S. company to a related foreign company to certain minimum taxes (Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax); •eliminates certain prior tax incentives for manufacturing in the United States and creates an incentive for U.S. companies to sell, lease or license goods and services abroad by allowing for a reduction in taxes owed on earnings related to such sales; •allows the cost of investments in certain depreciable assets acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017 to be immediately expensed; and •reduces deductions with respect to certain compensation paid to specified executive officers. While the changes from the TCJA are generally effective beginning in 2018, U.S. GAAP accounting for income taxes requires the effect of a change in tax laws or rates to be recognized in income from continuing operations for the period that includes the enactment date. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of the TCJA, the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB No. 118”) allowed the Company to record provisional amounts in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017. Where reasonable estimates can be made, the provisional accounting should be based on such estimates. When no reasonable estimate can be made, the provisional accounting may be based on the tax law in effect before the TCJA. The Company is required to complete its tax accounting for the TCJA within a one year period when it has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information to complete the income tax accounting. 43Table of ContentsThe Company has not completed its accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the TCJA; however, as described below, the Company has made reasonable estimates of the effects of the TCJA on its Consolidated Financial Statements which are included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations: •Deferred tax assets and liabilities: U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities were remeasured based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21.0%, resulting in an income tax benefit of approximately $1.2 billion. The Company will continue to analyze certain aspects of the TCJA which could potentially affect the tax basis of the reported amounts. Additionally, the Company’s U.S. tax returns for 2017 will be filed during the fourth quarter of 2018 and any changes to the tax positions for temporary differences compared to the estimates used will result in an adjustment of the estimated tax benefit recorded as of December 31, 2017. •Transition Tax effects: The Transition Tax is based on the Company’s total post-1986 earnings and profits that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. The Company recorded a provisional amount for the Transition Tax expense resulting in an increase in income tax expense of approximately $1.2 billion. The Company will continue to evaluate the TCJA and any future guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department and IRS in the determination of the Transition Tax which could result in adjustment of the estimate recorded as of December 31, 2017. •Indefinite reinvestment: As of December 31, 2017, the Company held $593 million of cash and approximately $656 million of cash equivalents (as defined by the TCJA, including trade accounts receivable net of trade accounts payable balances and certain accrued expenses) outside the United States. While repatriation of some cash held outside the United States may be restricted by local laws, most of the Company’s foreign cash could be repatriated to the United States. Following enactment of the TCJA and the associated Transition Tax, in general, repatriation of cash to the United States can be completed with no incremental U.S. tax; however, repatriation of cash could subject the Company to non-U.S. jurisdictional taxes on distributions. The cash that the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments, including acquisitions. The income taxes applicable to such earnings are not readily determinable or practicable. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the TCJA on its election to indefinitely reinvest certain of its non-U.S. earnings. The Company will continue to analyze the effects of the TCJA on its Consolidated Financial Statements and operations. Additional impacts from the enactment of the TCJA will be recorded as they are identified during the measurement period as provided for in SAB No. 118, which extends up to one year from the enactment date. Year-Over-Year Changes in the Tax Provision and Effective Tax RateThe Company’s effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was 16.0%, 17.5% and 14.4%, respectively.The Company’s effective tax rate for each of 2017, 2016 and 2015 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35.0% due principally to the Company’s earnings outside the United States that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate. In addition: •The effective tax rate of 16.0% in 2017 includes 500 basis points of net tax benefits related to the revaluation of net U.S. deferred tax liabilities from 35.0% to 21.0% due to the TCJA and release of reserves upon statute of limitation expiration, partially offset by income tax expense related to the Transition Tax on foreign earnings due to the TCJA and changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions.•The effective tax rate of 17.5% in 2016 includes 350 basis points of net tax benefits from permanent foreign exchange losses and the release of reserves upon the expiration of statutes of limitation and audit settlements, partially offset by income tax expense related to repatriation of earnings and legal entity realignments associated with the Separation and changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions.•The effective tax rate of 14.4% in 2015 includes 290 basis points of net tax benefits from permanent foreign exchange losses, releases of valuation allowances related to foreign operating losses and the release of reserves upon the expiration of statutes of limitation, partially offset by changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions.The Company conducts business globally, and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. The countries in which the Company has a material presence that have had significantly lower statutory tax rates than the United States include China, Denmark, Germany, Singapore, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The Company’s ability to obtain a tax benefit from lower statutory tax rates outside of the United States depends on its levels of taxable income in these foreign countries and the amount of foreign earnings which are indefinitely reinvested in those 44Table of Contentscountries. The Company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements given the geographic dispersion of the Company’s taxable income. The Company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities. The IRS has completed substantially all of the examinations of the Company’s federal income tax returns through 2011 and is currently examining certain of the Company’s federal income tax returns for 2012 through 2015. In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and various other countries, states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2004 through 2015. Tax authorities in Denmark have raised significant issues related to interest accrued by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. On December 10, 2013, the Company received assessments from the Danish tax authority (“SKAT”) totaling approximately DKK 1.5 billion (approximately $245 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2017) including interest through December 31, 2017, imposing withholding tax relating to interest accrued in Denmark on borrowings from certain of the Company’s subsidiaries for the years 2004-2009. The Company is currently in discussions with SKAT and anticipates receiving an assessment for years 2010-2012 totaling approximately DKK 895 million (approximately $144 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2017) including interest through December 31, 2017. Management believes the positions the Company has taken in Denmark are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and is vigorously defending its positions. The Company appealed these assessments with the National Tax Tribunal in 2014 and intends on pursuing this matter through the European Court of Justice should this appeal be unsuccessful. The ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, could take many years, and could result in a material adverse impact to the Company’s financial statements, including its effective tax rate. After considering the effect of the TCJA, the Company expects its 2018 effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Any future legislative changes in the United States including regulations related to the TCJA or potential tax reform in other jurisdictions, could cause the Company’s effective tax rate to differ from this estimate. Refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to income taxes.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS As further discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, discontinued operations includes the results of the Fortive businesses which were disposed of during the third quarter of 2016 as well as the results of the Company’s former communications business which was disposed of during the third quarter of 2015. All periods presented have been restated to reflect the Fortive and communications businesses within discontinued operations. In 2017, Danaher recorded a $22 million income tax benefit related to the release of previously provided reserves associated with uncertain tax positions on certain Danaher tax returns which were jointly filed with Fortive entities. These reserves were released due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for those returns. All Fortive entity-related balances were included in the income tax benefit related to discontinued operations. In 2016, earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, were $400 million and reflected the operating results of the Fortive businesses prior to the Separation. In 2015, earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, were approximately $1.6 billion and reflected the operations of both the Fortive and communications businesses as well as the gain on the sale of the communications business in 2015.COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEComprehensive income increased by approximately $1.7 billion in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to increased earnings from continuing operations, an increased gain from foreign currency translation adjustments compared to 2016, pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments and the decrease in the unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities from the sale of certain marketable equity securities, partially offset by lower net earnings attributable to discontinued operations in 2017 compared to 2016. The Company recorded a foreign currency translation gain of $976 million for 2017 compared to a translation loss of $517 million for 2016. The Company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit gain of $71 million for 2017 compared to a loss of $58 million for 2016.Comprehensive income decreased by $617 million in 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to the impact of decreases in net earnings attributable to discontinued operations, foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to most major currencies during the year but at a lower rate than in the prior year, and pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments. The Company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $517 million for 2016 45Table of Contentscompared to a translation loss of $976 million for 2015. The Company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit loss of $58 million in 2016 compared to a gain of $81 million in 2015.INFLATIONThe effect of inflation on the Company’s revenues and net earnings was not significant in any of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENTThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices as well as credit risk, each of which could impact its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. In addition, the Company’s broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole.Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. A change in interest rates on long-term debt impacts the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt but not the Company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2017, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt (excluding the LYONs, which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from the value of its underlying common stock) by $470 million.As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s variable-rate debt obligations consisted primarily of U.S. dollar and euro-based commercial paper borrowings (refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2017). As a result, the Company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term interest rates. As these shorter duration obligations mature, the Company may issue additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. In 2017, the average annual interest rate associated with outstanding commercial paper borrowings was approximately 6 basis points. A hypothetical increase of this average to 18 basis points would have increased the Company’s annual interest expense by $4 million. The hypothetical increase used is the actual amount by which the Company’s commercial paper interest rates fluctuated during 2017.Currency Exchange Rate RiskThe Company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than Danaher’s functional currency or the functional currency of its applicable subsidiary. The Company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign operations into U.S. dollars, Danaher’s functional currency. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the Company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of stockholders’ equity. Currency exchange rates positively impacted 2017 reported sales by 0.5% on a year-over-year basis as the U.S. dollar weakened against the euro, partially offset by the effect of the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi. If the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2017 were to prevail throughout 2018, currency exchange rates would positively impact 2018 estimated sales by approximately 2.0% relative to the Company’s performance in 2017. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would adversely impact the Company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis. Any weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would positively impact the Company’s sales and results of operations.The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales and net earnings in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In 46Table of Contentsaddition, the Company has assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies. The Company’s foreign currency-denominated debt partially hedges its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2017 would have reduced foreign currency-denominated net assets and stockholders’ equity by $880 million.Equity Price RiskThe Company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio has in the past included publicly traded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price. However, during 2017 the Company sold substantially all of its available-for-sale equity securities. Commodity Price RiskFor a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”Credit RiskThe Company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, receivables from customers and derivatives. The Company places cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the Company’s customers. The Company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate.The Company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and such transactions are generally insignificant to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. These transactions are typically entered into with high-quality financial institutions and exposure at any one institution is limited.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESManagement assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing requirements. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses, consummating strategic acquisitions, paying interest and servicing debt and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis.47Table of ContentsFollowing is an overview of the Company’s cash flows and liquidity for the years ended December 31:Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity($ in millions)2017 2016 2015Total operating cash flows provided by continuing operations$3,477.8 $3,087.5 $2,832.2 Cash paid for acquisitions$(385.8) $(4,880.1) $(14,247.8)Payments for additions to property, plant and equipment(619.6) (589.6) (512.9)Proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment32.6 9.8 60.4Payments for purchases of investments— — (87.1)Proceeds from sales of investments137.9 264.8 43.0All other investing activities(8.5) 21.9 5.9Total investing cash used in discontinued operations— (69.8) (212.5)Net cash used in investing activities$(843.4) $(5,243.0) $(14,951.0) Proceeds from the issuance of common stock$68.8 $164.5 $249.0Payment of dividends(378.3) (399.8) (354.1)Payment for purchase of noncontrolling interest(64.4) — —Make-whole premiums to redeem borrowings prior to maturity— (188.1) —Net (repayments of) proceeds from borrowings (maturities of 90 days or less)(3,778.5) 2,218.1 3,511.2Proceeds from borrowings (maturities longer than 90 days)1,782.1 3,240.9 5,682.9Repayments of borrowings (maturities longer than 90 days)(668.4) (2,480.6) (35.5)All other financing activities(59.8) (27.0) (3.3)Cash distributions to Fortive, net— (485.3) —Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities$(3,098.5) $2,042.7 $9,050.2•Operating cash flows from continuing operations increased $390 million, or approximately 13%, during 2017 as compared to 2016, due primarily to higher earnings which also included higher noncash charges for depreciation and amortization. The increase was partially offset by (1) the gain on sale of marketable equity securities in 2017, reduced by the net impact in 2016 of the gain from the sale of marketable equity securities and the loss on early extinguishment of borrowings; and (2) the increase in cash flows used for trade accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable.•Net cash used in investing activities during 2017 consisted primarily of cash paid for acquisitions and additions to property, plant and equipment. The Company acquired ten businesses during 2017 for total consideration (including assumed debt and net of cash acquired) of approximately $386 million. Payments for additions to property, plant and equipment increased $30 million in 2017 compared to 2016 and include investments in other operating assets, particularly new facilities and operating assets at newly acquired businesses. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from sales of investments, which includes cash proceeds of $138 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities. •The Company used cash generated from operations as well as the proceeds from the long-term borrowings noted below to reduce net outstanding borrowings with maturities of 90 days or less, primarily commercial paper borrowings, by approximately $3.8 billion.•During 2017, the Company issued approximately $1.8 billion of euro, Japanese yen and Swiss franc-denominated long-term indebtedness (based on applicable exchange rates as of the pricing dates of the respective notes; refer to Note 9 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) and used the proceeds to repay commercial paper borrowings as well as the €500 million of senior unsecured bonds and the CHF 100 million of senior unsecured bonds that matured in 2017.•As of December 31, 2017, the Company held $630 million of cash and cash equivalents.48Table of ContentsOperating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows.Operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $3.5 billion for 2017, an increase of $390 million, or approximately 13%, as compared to 2016. The year-over-year change in operating cash flows from 2016 to 2017 was primarily attributable to the following factors:•2017 operating cash flows benefited from higher net earnings in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase was partially offset by the gain on sale of marketable equity securities in 2017, reduced by the net impact in 2016 of the gain from the sale of marketable equity securities and the loss on early extinguishment of borrowings. The cash flow impacts of the gains from the sale of marketable equity securities is reflected in the investing activities section of the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, and the cash flow impact of the loss on early extinguishment of borrowings is reflected in the financing activities section of the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and therefore, do not contribute to operating cash flows.•The aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable used $243 million in operating cash flows during 2017, compared to $96 million of operating cash flows used in 2016. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively the Company manages the cash conversion cycle, which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day it pays for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from its customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period.•The aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets, deferred income taxes and accrued expenses and other liabilities used $110 million in operating cash flows during 2017, compared to $196 million used in 2016. The timing of cash payments for income taxes and various employee related liabilities drove the majority of this change.•Net earnings from continuing operations for 2017 reflected an increase of $110 million of depreciation and amortization expense as compared to 2016. Amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions. Depreciation expense relates to both the Company’s manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operating-type lease arrangements. Depreciation and amortization are noncash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows.Operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $3.1 billion for 2016, an increase of $255 million, or 9% as compared to 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in net earnings from continuing operations in 2016 as compared to 2015.Investing ActivitiesCash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures, including instruments leased to customers, cash used for investments and cash proceeds from divestitures of businesses or assets.Net cash used in investing activities was $843 million during 2017 compared to approximately $5.2 billion and approximately $15.0 billion of net cash used in 2016 and 2015, respectively.Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of Investments2017 Acquisitions and Sale of InvestmentsFor a discussion of the Company’s 2017 acquisitions and sale of investments, refer to “—Overview.”2016 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of InvestmentsFor a discussion of the Company’s 2016 Separation of its former Test & Measurement segment, Industrial Technologies segment (excluding the product identification businesses) and retail/commercial petroleum business, refer to “—Overview.”On November 4, 2016, Copper Merger Sub, Inc., a California corporation and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Cepheid, a California corporation, for $53.00 per share in cash, for a total purchase price of approximately $4.0 billion, net of assumed debt and acquired cash (the “Cepheid 49Table of ContentsAcquisition”). Cepheid is now part of the Company’s Diagnostics segment. Cepheid generated revenues of $539 million in 2015. The Company initially financed the Cepheid acquisition price with available cash and proceeds from the issuance of U.S. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper.In addition to the Cepheid Acquisition, during 2016 the Company acquired seven businesses for total consideration of $882 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company’s four segments. The aggregate annual sales of these seven businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $237 million.During 2016, the Company received cash proceeds of $265 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and recorded a pretax gain related to this sale of $223 million ($140 million after-tax or $0.20 per diluted share).2015 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of InvestmentsOn August 31, 2015, Pentagon Merger Sub, Inc., a New York corporation and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pall, a New York corporation, for $127.20 per share in cash, for a total purchase price of approximately $13.6 billion, net of assumed debt of $417 million and acquired cash of approximately $1.2 billion (the “Pall Acquisition”). Pall is part of the Company’s Life Sciences segment. In its fiscal year ended July 31, 2015, Pall generated consolidated revenues of approximately $2.8 billion.The Company initially financed the approximately $13.6 billion acquisition price of Pall with approximately $2.5 billion of available cash, approximately $8.1 billion of net proceeds from the issuance and sale of U.S. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper and €2.7 billion (approximately $3.0 billion based on currency exchange rates as of the date of issuance) of net proceeds from the issuance and sale of euro-denominated senior unsecured notes. In addition to the Pall Acquisition, during 2015 the Company acquired nine businesses for total consideration of approximately $670 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company’s four segments. The aggregate annual sales of these nine businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $355 million.In July 2015, the Company consummated the split-off of the majority of its former communications business to Danaher shareholders who elected to exchange Danaher shares for ownership interests in the communications business, and the subsequent merger of the communications business with a subsidiary of NetScout. Danaher shareholders who participated in the exchange offer tendered 26 million shares of Danaher common stock (approximately $2.3 billion on the date of tender) and received 62.5 million shares of NetScout common stock which represented approximately 60% of the shares of NetScout common stock outstanding following the combination. The accounting requirements for reporting the disposition of the communications business as a discontinued operation were met when the split-off and merger were completed. Accordingly, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented reflect this business as discontinued operations. The Company allocated a portion of the consolidated interest expense to discontinued operations based on the ratio of the discontinued business’ net assets to the Company’s consolidated net assets. The Company recorded an aggregate after-tax gain on the disposition of this business of $767 million, or $1.08 per diluted share, in its 2015 results in connection with the closing of this transaction representing the value of the 26 million shares of Company common stock tendered for the communications business in excess of the carrying value of the business’ net assets. This gain was included in the results of discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. The communications business had revenues of $346 million in 2015 prior to the disposition.During 2015, the Company received cash proceeds of $43 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and recorded a pretax gain related to these sales of $12 million ($8 million after-tax or $0.01 per diluted share).Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development, improving information technology systems and the manufacture of instruments that are used in operating-type lease arrangements that certain of the Company’s businesses enter into with customers. Capital expenditures totaled $620 million in 2017, $590 million in 2016 and $513 million in 2015. The increase in capital spending in 2017 was due to increased investments in other operating assets, particularly new facilities, and operating assets at newly acquired businesses. The increase in capital spending in 2016 was due to increased investments in machinery and equipment, including operating assets at newly acquired businesses such as Pall, and to a lesser extent, increases in equipment leased to customers. In 2018, the Company expects capital spending to be approximately $700 million, though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions.50Table of ContentsFinancing ActivitiesCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper and other debt, issuances and repurchases of common stock, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and payments of cash dividends to shareholders. Financing activities used cash of approximately $3.1 billion during 2017 compared to approximately $2.0 billion of cash provided during 2016. The year-over-year increase in cash used in financing activities was due primarily to higher net repayments of commercial paper borrowings in 2017 as compared to 2016 (as the Company increased its commercial paper borrowings in 2016 for the Cepheid acquisition) as well as lower proceeds from the issuance of debt in 2017 as compared to 2016. These impacts were partially offset by lower repayments of long-term debt in 2017 as compared to the comparable period of 2016 as the Company used a portion of the proceeds from the Fortive Distribution to repay outstanding long-term indebtedness in August 2016.Financing activities provided cash of approximately $2.0 billion during 2016 compared to approximately $9.1 billion of cash provided during 2015. Cash provided by financing activities in 2016 primarily relates to approximately $3.4 billion of net proceeds received from the issuance of the Fortive Debt in June 2016 and the net issuance of outstanding borrowings with maturities of 90 days or less, primarily commercial paper borrowings, of approximately $2.2 billion, and the issuance of approximately ¥29.9 billion aggregate principal amount (approximately $262 million based on the currency exchange rate as of the date of the issuance) of 0.352% senior unsecured notes. These issuances were partially offset by the repayment of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.3% senior unsecured notes that matured in June 2016, the repayment of approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness in August 2016 (consisting of the Redeemed Notes), the repayment of the CHF 120 million ($124 million) aggregate principal amount of the 4.0% senior unsecured notes due in October 2016 and $485 million of cash distributed to Fortive in connection with the Separation. Total debt was approximately $10.5 billion and $12.3 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company had the ability to incur an additional $1.6 billion of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facility based on the amounts available under the Company’s $4.0 billion credit facility which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2017. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s financing activities and indebtedness, including the Company’s outstanding debt as of December 31, 2017, and the Company’s commercial paper program and related credit facility.Shelf Registration StatementThe Company has filed a “well-known seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance. The Company utilized this shelf registration statement for the offering and sale of the U.S. dollar and euro-denominated senior unsecured notes issued in 2015 and 2017. The Company expects to use net proceeds realized by the Company from future securities sales off this shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, including without limitation repayment or refinancing of debt or other corporate obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends and/or working capital.Stock Repurchase ProgramPlease see “Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Item 5 of Part II of this Annual Report for a description of the Company’s stock repurchase program.DividendsThe Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share that was paid on January 26, 2018 to holders of record on December 29, 2017. Aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2017 were $378 million. Dividend payments were lower in 2017 as compared to 2016 as the Company decreased the per share amount of its quarterly dividend in the third quarter of 2016 as a result of the Fortive Separation.For a description of the dividend of Fortive shares in July 2016, refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Cash and Cash RequirementsAs of December 31, 2017, the Company held $630 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment-grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an approximate weighted average annual interest rate of 0.9%. Of this amount, $37 million was held within the United States and $593 million was held outside of the United States. The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures and acquisitions, 51Table of Contentspay interest and service debt, pay taxes and any related interest or penalties, fund its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock and support other business needs. The Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, particularly in connection with acquisitions, the Company may also borrow under its commercial paper programs or credit facility, enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper programs and/or access the capital markets. The Company also may from time to time access the capital markets to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions.While repatriation of some cash held outside the United States may be restricted by local laws, most of the Company’s foreign cash could be repatriated to the United States. Following enactment of the TCJA and the associated Transition Tax, in general, repatriation of cash to the United States can be completed with no incremental U.S. tax; however, repatriation of cash could subject the Company to non-U.S. jurisdictional taxes on distributions. The cash that the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments, including acquisitions. The income taxes applicable to such earnings are not readily determinable or practicable. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the TCJA on its election to indefinitely reinvest certain of its non-U.S. earnings. As of December 31, 2017, management believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs, including its cash needs in the United States.During 2017, the Company contributed $53 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans and $45 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2018, the Company’s cash contribution requirements for its U.S. and its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately $30 million and $50 million, respectively. The ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan’s funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates and other factors.Contractual ObligationsThe following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 under (1) debt obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet The amounts presented in the “Other long-term liabilities” line in the table below include $670 million of noncurrent gross unrecognized tax benefits and related interest (and do not include $66 million of current gross unrecognized tax benefits which are included in the “Accrued expenses and other liabilities” line on the Consolidated Balance Sheet). However, the timing of the long-term portion of these liabilities is uncertain, and therefore, they have been included in the “More Than 5 Years” column in the table below. Refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits. Certain of the Company’s acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table below does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts of any such payments are uncertain. Refer to “—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” for a discussion of other contractual obligations that are not reflected in the table below.($ in millions)Total Less ThanOne Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than5 YearsDebt and leases: Debt obligations (a)(b)$10,503.8 $190.1 $4,534.3 $1,590.1 $4,189.3Capital lease obligations (b)18.3 4.6 0.8 0.9 12.0Total debt and leases10,522.1 194.7 4,535.1 1,591.0 4,201.3Interest payments on debt and capital lease obligations (c)1,277.8 150.2 252.7 183.4 691.5Operating lease obligations (d)797.4 199.4 297.5 178.7 121.8Other: Purchase obligations (e)610.2 533.2 62.4 9.4 5.2Other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet (f)5,161.1 — 625.0 448.3 4,087.8Total$18,368.6 $1,077.5 $5,772.7 $2,410.8 $9,107.6(a) As described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(b) Amounts do not include interest payments. Interest on debt and capital lease obligations is reflected in a separate line in the table.(c) Interest payments on debt are projected for future periods using the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2017. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates.52Table of Contents(d) As described in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain leases require the Company to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises. These future costs are not included in the table above.(e) Consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction.(f) Primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies and allowances, performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs, self-insurance and litigation claims, postretirement benefits, pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities and deferred compensation obligations. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management’s estimates over the terms of these arrangements and is largely based upon historical experience.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsGuarantees and Related InstrumentsThe following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of guarantees and related instruments of the Company as of December 31, 2017. Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period($ in millions)Total Less ThanOne Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than5 YearsGuarantees and related instruments$611.2 $506.9 $57.4 $24.8 $22.1Guarantees and related instruments consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit, bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds. These have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors, customers, insurance providers, financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure the Company’s obligations and/or performance requirements related to specific transactions.Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters or tax matters. In particular, in connection with the 2016 Fortive Separation and the 2015 split-off of the Company’s communications business, Danaher entered into separation and distribution and related agreements pursuant to which Danaher agreed to indemnify the other parties against certain damages and expenses that might occur in the future. These indemnification obligations cover a variety of liabilities, including, but not limited to, employee, tax and environmental matters. The Company has not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they relate to unknown conditions and the Company cannot estimate the potential liabilities from such matters, but the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. In addition, as a result of these divestitures, as well as restructuring activities, certain properties leased by the Company have been sublet to third-parties. In the event any of these third-parties vacate any of these premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by such sub-lessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In the normal course of business, the Company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers, suppliers or other business partners for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the Company’s products or services or claims alleging that Company products or services infringe third-party intellectual property. The Company has not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual obligations table above. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations.The Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the Company, or by reason of serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to limited exceptions. Danaher’s Amended and Restated By-laws provide for similar indemnification rights. In addition, Danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of Danaher Corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which Danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding. While the Company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage.53Table of ContentsLegal ProceedingsRefer to “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies, and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESManagement’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience, the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments.The Company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period-to-period. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Acquired Intangibles—The Company’s business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill, in-process R&D and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the Company may incur. Refer to Notes 1, 2 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s policies relating to goodwill, acquired intangibles and acquisitions.In performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market-based approach. In evaluating the estimates derived by the market-based approach, management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected. In certain circumstances the Company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (i.e., an income approach) in order to validate the results of the market approach. The discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had eight reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment. Management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units decreases as these businesses are integrated into the Company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2017 indicated that in all instances, the fair values of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 50% to approximately 600%. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this hypothetical 10% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 35% to approximately 530%.The Company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company also tests intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. These analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues, expenses, market conditions and discount rates related to these assets.If actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, the Company’s estimates of goodwill and intangible assets have been materially correct.54Table of ContentsContingent Liabilities—As discussed in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors, including those discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If the reserves established by the Company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s financial statements.Revenue Recognition—The Company derives revenues from the sale of products and services. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s revenue recognition policies. Although most of the Company’s sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, certain agreements contain multiple elements or nonstandard terms and conditions. As a result, judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if so, how the consideration should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. The Company allocates revenue to each element in the contractual arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy that, in some instances, may require the Company to estimate the selling price of certain deliverables that are not sold separately or where third-party evidence of pricing is not observable. The Company’s estimate of selling price impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements. The Company also enters into lease arrangements with customers, which requires the Company to determine whether the arrangements are operating or sales-type leases. Certain of the Company’s lease contracts are customized for larger customers and often result in complex terms and conditions that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criteria.On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance. Refer to ‘New Accounting Standards’ in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company’s adoption of this ASU.If the Company’s judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect, the Company’s reported revenues in particular periods may be incorrect. Historically, the Company’s estimates of revenue have been materially correct.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits—For a description of the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit accounting practices, refer to Notes 10 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations, including assumptions regarding discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rates of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. If the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change (as a result of differences in actual experience, changes in key economic indicators or other factors) the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements could be materially affected. A 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the U.S. net obligation by $146 million ($111 million on an after-tax basis) and the non-U.S. net obligation by $142 million ($107 million on an after-tax basis) from the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2017. A 50 basis point increase in the discount rates used for the plans would have decreased the U.S. net obligation by $134 million ($102 million on an after-tax basis) and the non-U.S. net obligation by $137 million ($104 million on an after-tax basis) from the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2017.For 2017, the estimated long-term rate of return for the U.S. plans is 7.0%, and the Company intends to continue to use an assumption of 7.0% for 2018. The estimated long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plans was determined on a plan-by-plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 1.0% to 5.8%. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2017 was reduced by 50 basis points, pension expense for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans for 2017 would have increased $9 million ($6 million on an after-tax basis) and $5 million ($4 million on an after-tax basis), respectively.For a discussion of the Company’s 2017 and anticipated 2018 defined benefit pension plan contributions, refer to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources – Cash and Cash Requirements”.Income Taxes—For a description of the Company’s income tax accounting policies, refer to Notes 1 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. This requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding: (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and 55Table of Contents(3) the impact of tax planning strategies. Future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when, based upon the technical merits, it is “more likely than not” that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. Judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions. The Company re-evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances, including when: (1) a tax audit is completed; (2) applicable tax laws change, including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (3) the applicable statute of limitations expires.On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted, which substantially changes the U.S. tax system, including lowering the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% (beginning in 2018), and affected the Company in a number of ways. Under U.S. GAAP, the Company is required to account for tax legislation when the legislation is enacted. Accordingly, the Company has reflected the provisional estimate of changes from the TCJA in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2017 based upon the Company’s analysis of the legislation using available information. Certain assumptions related to the impact of the TCJA will require continued monitoring and further analysis including the amount of foreign cash and undistributed earnings subject to the Transition Tax, the amount of available credits to reduce required payments of the Transition Tax and the impact of estimated temporary differences between book and taxable income in 2017 or prior periods under audit by the IRS. Although the Company believes that its estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from these estimates. The Company will continue to refine these estimates throughout 2018 and record any required adjustments as they are determined as permitted by SAB No. 118. The U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS have not yet issued regulations implementing the new tax law, and these regulations could result in changes to the Company’s estimates. Some or all of these judgments are also subject to review by the IRS. If the IRS were to successfully challenge the Company’s right to realize some or all of the tax benefit the Company has recorded, based on current interpretation of the law regarding certain items, or if the amount of the Transition Tax or other tax liabilities are understated, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements.In addition, certain of the Company’s tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in Denmark (refer to “—Results of Operations – Income Taxes” and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws. However, the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in the Company being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, including its effective tax rate.An increase of 1.0% in the Company’s 2017 nominal tax rate would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $29 million.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSFor a discussion of the new accounting standards impacting the Company, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.ITEM 7A.

313616,DHR,DANAHER CORP /DE/,2019,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Annual Report. For a discussion of risks related to the Company’s non-U.S. operations and foreign currency exchange, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”Major CustomersNo customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated sales in 2018, 2017 or 2016.Available InformationThe Company maintains an internet website at www.danaher.com. The Company makes available free of charge on the website its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material with, or furnishing such material to, the SEC. Danaher’s internet site and the information contained on or connected to that site are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, economic conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws, regulations or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.We intend to spin-off our Dental business into an independent, publicly-traded company in the second half of 2019. The proposed transaction may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits.We have announced our intention to spin-off Danaher’s Dental business into an independent, publicly-traded company in the second half of 2019, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including obtaining final approval from the Danaher Board of Directors, satisfactory completion of financing, receipt of tax opinions, receipt of favorable rulings from the IRS and receipt of other regulatory approvals. Unanticipated developments, including possible delays in obtaining various tax rulings, regulatory approvals or clearances and trade qualifications, uncertainty of the financial markets or changes in the Company’s cash requirements and challenges in establishing infrastructure or processes, could delay or prevent the proposed separation or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable and/or different than expected. Even if the transaction is completed, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the spin-off. Expenses incurred to accomplish the proposed separation may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate. Executing the proposed separation also requires significant time and attention from management, which could distract them from other tasks in 11operating our business. Following the proposed separation, the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companies may not be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred.Conditions in the global economy, the particular markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our business is sensitive to general economic conditions. Slower global economic growth, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt, volatility in the currency and credit markets, high levels of unemployment or underemployment, reduced levels of capital expenditures, changes or anticipation of potential changes in government trade, fiscal, tax and monetary policies, changes in capital requirements for financial institutions, government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics, sequestration, austerity measures and other challenges that affect the global economy may adversely affect the Company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, including having the effect of:•reducing demand for our products and services (in this Annual Report, references to products and services also includes software), limiting the financing available to our customers and suppliers, increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies;•increasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories;•increasing price competition in our served markets; •supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; •increasing the risk of impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, and the risk that we may not be able to fully recover the value of other assets such as real estate and tax assets; •increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which, in addition to increasing the risks identified above, could result in preference actions against us; and•adversely impacting market sizes and growth rates.Although we have been able to access the commercial paper and other capital markets through the date of this report, there can be no assurances that such markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facility will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations.If growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period, if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve, our business and financial statements could be adversely affected.Significant developments or uncertainties stemming from the U.S. administration, including changes in U.S. trade policies, tariffs and the reaction of other countries thereto, could have an adverse effect on our business.Changes, potential changes or uncertainties in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate, or governing the health care system and drug prices could adversely affect our business and financial statements. For example, the U.S. administration has increased tariffs on certain goods imported into the United States, raised the possibility of imposing significant, additional tariff increases and called for substantial changes to trade agreements. These factors have adversely affected, and in the future could further adversely affect, our business and financial statements.Our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve, and visibility into our markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies, and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities. Demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which 12may be affected by announced price changes, marketing or promotional programs, new product introductions, the timing of industry trade shows and changes in distributor or customer inventory levels due to distributor or customer management thereof or other factors. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period. We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share. Even if we compete effectively, we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services.Our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. Because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors; refer to “Item 1. Business—Competition” for additional details. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets, including high-growth markets. In addition, significant shifts in industry market share have occurred and may in the future occur in connection with product problems, safety alerts and publications about products, reflecting the competitive significance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems in our industry. Our failure to compete effectively and/or pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements, and our expansion into new markets may result in greater-than-expected risks, liabilities and expenses. In addition, the Company is exposed to the risk that its competitors or its customers may introduce private label, generic or low-cost products that compete with the Company’s products at lower price points. If these competitors’ products capture significant market share or result in a decrease in market prices overall, this could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements.Our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation.We generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis, our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer. Our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to:•correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;•allocate our R&D funding to products and services with higher growth prospects;•anticipate and respond to our competitors’ development of new products and services and technological innovations;•differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings and avoid commoditization;•innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets;•obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies before our competitors do;•successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time;•obtain necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope (including with respect to medical device products by demonstrating satisfactory clinical results where applicable, as well as achieving third-party reimbursement); and•stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies.If we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in R&D of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. In addition, promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, uncertainty over third-party reimbursement or entrenched patterns of clinical practice. Competitors may also develop after-market services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products.13Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.Certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. FDA and by comparable agencies of other countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information. Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements.Certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the U.S. FDA, by other federal and state governmental agencies, by comparable agencies of other countries and regions, by certain accrediting bodies and by regulations governing hazardous materials and drugs-of abuse (or the manufacture and sale of products containing any such materials). The global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent and unpredictable. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years, and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, their existing regulations. For example, the EU has adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (the “EU MDR”) and the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the “EU IVDR”), each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. Manufacturers of currently approved medical devices will have until May 2020 to meet the requirements of the EU MDR and until May 2022 to meet the EU IVDR. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements.To varying degrees, these regulators require us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution and post-marketing surveillance of our products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance (such as 510(k) clearance) or approvals for our new products or modifications to (or additional indications or uses of) existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be time-consuming, costly and subject to restrictions. Our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors, for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results, and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained. Even after initial regulatory clearance or approval, we are subject to periodic inspection by these regulatory authorities, and if safety issues arise we may be required to amend conditions for use of a product, such as providing additional warnings on the product’s label or narrowing its approved intended use, which could reduce the product’s market acceptance. Failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products (or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products), other violations of these regulations, failure to remediate inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products (even after obtaining clearance for distribution) and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to FDA Form 483 Inspectional Observations, warning letters, notices to customers, declining sales, loss of customers, loss of market share, remediation and increased compliance costs, recalls, seizures of adulterated or misbranded products, injunctions, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, narrowing of permitted uses for a product, suspension or withdrawal of approvals and pre-market notification rescissions. We are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse, pricing and sales and marketing practices in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information, including the federal regulations described in “Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters.” 14Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in the adverse effects referenced below under “Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and our business, including our reputation.” Compliance with regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses.Our products are subject to clinical trials, the results of which may be unexpected, or perceived as unfavorable by the market, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.As a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unexpected or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials, or a regulator’s or the market’s perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate and our business and financial statements.The health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, which could adversely affect our financial statements.The health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, including the following:•many of our customers, and the end-users to whom our customers supply products, rely on government funding of and reimbursement for health care products and services and research activities. The U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “PPACA”), health care austerity measures in other countries and other potential health care reform changes and government austerity measures have reduced and may further reduce the amount of government funding or reimbursement available to customers or end-users of our products and services and/or the volume of medical procedures using our products and services. For example, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, introduced a multi-year pricing program for services payable under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (“CLFS”) that is designed to bring Medicare allowable amounts in line with the amounts paid by private payers. It is still unclear whether and to what extent these new rates will affect overall pricing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing services, but if our customers conclude that Medicare reimbursement for these services is inadequate, it could in turn adversely impact the prices at which we sell our products. Other countries, as well as some private payors also control the price of health care products, directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing or coverage limitations, tying reimbursement to outcomes or (in the case of governmental entities) through compulsory licensing. Global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement.•the PPACA imposes on medical device manufacturers, such as Danaher, a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of certain medical devices. The excise tax has been suspended until the end of 2019, but the Company would be subject to the tax beginning in 2020.•governmental and private health care providers and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the delivery of health care services, centralizing purchasing, limiting the number of vendors that may participate in purchasing programs, forming group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks and pursuing consolidation to improve their purchasing leverage and using competitive bid processes to procure health care products and services.These changes as well as other impacts from market demand, government regulations, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures have started changing the way healthcare is delivered, reimbursed and funded and may cause participants in the health care industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services, reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products and services from governmental agencies or third-party payors, heighten clinical data requirements, reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services, affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products and increase our compliance and other costs. In addition, we may be excluded from important market segments or unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us, and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability. All of the factors described above could adversely affect our business and financial statements.15Any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices, and to make appropriate investments that support our long-term strategy, could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price.Our ability to grow revenues, earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies, and to make appropriate investments that support our long-term strategy. We may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price. Promising acquisitions and investments are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including high valuations, competition among prospective buyers, the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain applicable antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms. In addition, competition for acquisitions and investments may result in higher purchase prices. Changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions and investments.Our acquisition of businesses, investments, joint ventures and other strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements.As part of our business strategy we acquire businesses, make investments and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course, and we also from time to time complete more significant transactions; refer to “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) for additional details. Acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our business and our financial statements:•any business, technology, service or product that we acquire or invest in could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable, or we could fail to operate any such business profitably.•we may incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships, which could also cause a deterioration of Danaher’s credit ratings, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense and diminish our future access to the capital markets.•acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations in any given period, or over the long-term.•pre-closing and post-closing earnings charges could adversely impact operating results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period-to-period.•acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships could create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address.•we could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other controls and systems and retaining key employees and customers.•we may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition, investment, joint venture or strategic relationship.•we may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company’s or investee’s activities and the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations.•in connection with acquisitions and joint ventures, we often enter into post-closing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments, earn-out obligations and indemnification obligations, which may have unpredictable financial results.•as a result of our acquisitions and investments, we have recorded significant goodwill and other assets on our balance sheet and if we are not able to realize the value of these assets, or if the fair value of our investments declines, we may be required to incur impairment charges.•we may have interests that diverge from those of our joint venture partners or other strategic partners and we may not be able to direct the management and operations of the joint venture or other strategic relationship in the manner we believe is most appropriate, exposing us to additional risk.16•investing in or making loans to early-stage companies often entails a high degree of risk, and we may not achieve the strategic, technological, financial or commercial benefits we anticipate; we may lose our investment or fail to recoup our loan; or our investment may be illiquid for a greater-than-expected period of time.The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements.Divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements.We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest, spin-off, split-off or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. For example, we split-off our communications business in 2015, spun-off our Fortive business in 2016 and have announced our intention to spin-off our Dental business in 2019. Transactions such as these pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements. For example, when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not become satisfied. In addition, divestitures or other dispositions may dilute the Company’s earnings per share, have other adverse financial, tax and accounting impacts and distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. In addition, we have retained responsibility for and/or have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold or disposed. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.We could incur significant liability if the anticipated spin-off of our Dental business, 2016 spin-off of Fortive Corporation (“Fortive”) or the 2015 split-off of our communications business is determined to be a taxable transaction.In July 2015, the Company consummated the split-off of the majority of its former communications business to Danaher shareholders who elected to exchange Danaher shares for ownership interests in the communications business, and the subsequent merger of the communications business with a subsidiary of NetScout Systems, Inc. Danaher shareholders who participated in the exchange offer tendered 26 million shares of Danaher common stock (approximately $2.3 billion on the date of tender) and received 62.5 million shares of NetScout common stock which represented approximately 60% of the shares of NetScout common stock outstanding following the combination.On July 2, 2016, Danaher completed the separation (the “Fortive Separation”) of its former Test & Measurement segment, Industrial Technologies segment (excluding the product identification businesses) and retail/commercial petroleum business by distributing to Danaher stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Fortive, the entity Danaher incorporated to hold such businesses. To effect the Fortive Separation, Danaher distributed to its stockholders one share of Fortive common stock for every two shares of Danaher common stock outstanding as of June 15, 2016, the record date for the distribution.As noted above, we have also announced our intention to spin-off Danaher’s Dental business into an independent, publicly-traded company in the second half of 2019, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.We have received opinions from outside tax counsel to the effect that each of the Fortive Separation in 2016 and the split-off of our communications business in 2015 qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code, and we anticipate receiving a similar opinion with respect to the planned Dental spin-off. The opinions relating to the Fortive spin-off and communications split-off rely (and we anticipate the opinion related to the Dental spin-off will rely) on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, our stockholders and we may not be able to rely on the respective opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that any such separations are taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the respective opinion. If any such transaction is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.17Potential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the 2016 spin-off of Fortive and the 2015 split-off of our communications business could materially and adversely affect our business and financial statements.We entered into a separation and distribution agreement and related agreements with Fortive to govern the Fortive Separation and the relationship between the two companies going forward. We entered into similar agreements with NetScout Systems, Inc. in connection with the split-off of our communications business and anticipate entering into similar agreements in connection with the spin-off of our Dental business. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party and could lead to disputes between us. If we are required to indemnify the other parties under the circumstances set forth in these agreements, we may be subject to substantial liabilities. In addition, with respect to the liabilities for which the other parties have agreed to indemnify us under these agreements, there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against such other parties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of the liabilities, or that such other parties will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. It is also possible that a court could disregard the allocation of assets and liabilities agreed to between Danaher and such other parties and require Danaher to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to such other parties. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business and financial statements.A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or data or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.We rely on information technology systems, some of which are provided and/or managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers, other business partners and patients), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as receiving and fulfilling orders, billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations). In addition, some of our remote monitoring products and services incorporate software and information technology that may house personal data and some products or software we sell to customers may connect to our systems for maintenance or other purposes. These systems, products and services (including those we acquire through business acquisitions) may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, human error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Attacks may also target hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. Security breaches of systems provided or enabled by us, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services, could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers, patients or suppliers. Like most multinational corporations, our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. Unauthorized tampering, adulteration or interference with our products may also adversely affect product functionality and result in loss of data, risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions. Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer, patient, business partner and employee relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.If we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches, we may suffer adverse regulatory consequences, business consequences and litigation. As a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. For example, in the United States, HIPAA privacy and security rules require certain of our operations to maintain controls to protect the availability and confidentiality of patient health information, individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy. The new EU General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018, has imposed significantly stricter requirements in how we collect and process personal data, including, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance. Several other countries such as China and Russia have passed, and other countries are considering passing, laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. In addition, compliance with the varying data privacy regulations around the world has required significant expenditures and may require additional expenditures, and may require changes in our products or business models that increase competition or reduce revenue.18Our operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.Our operations, products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment, establish standards for the use, generation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and impose end-of-life disposal and take-back programs. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the United States and abroad in connection with our operations. We cannot assure you that our environmental, health and safety compliance program (or the compliance programs of businesses we acquire) have been or will at all times be effective. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements.In addition, we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury, property damage or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury or damage due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. We may also become subject to additional remedial, compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules. For additional information regarding these risks, refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. We cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. However, based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2018 will have a material effect on our financial statements.Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and our business, including our reputation.In addition to the environmental, health, safety, health care, medical device, anticorruption, data privacy and other regulations noted elsewhere in this Annual Report, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional levels, including the following:•we are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons and dealings between our employees and between our subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory.•we also have agreements to sell products and services to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with government entities. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. Our agreements with government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification at the convenience of the government or in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors, and we may underestimate our costs of performing under the contract. In certain cases, a governmental entity may require us to pay back amounts it has paid to us. Government contracts that have been awarded to us following a bid process could become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder, which could result in loss of the contract. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts. These are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. The regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. We, our representatives and the industries in which we operate may at times be under review and/or investigation by regulatory authorities. Failure to comply (or any alleged or perceived failure to comply) with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and nonmonetary penalties, and any such failure or alleged failure (or becoming subject to a regulatory enforcement investigation) could also damage our reputation, disrupt our business, limit our ability to manufacture, import, export and sell products and services, result in loss of customers and disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and 19cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. Compliance with these and other regulations may also affect our returns on investment, require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our business. Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the International Standards Organization, and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our business and financial statements. For additional information regarding these risks, refer to “Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters.”Our restructuring actions could have long-term adverse effects on our business.In recent years, we have implemented significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. These restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities (including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses) reduce our available talent, assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers, limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases and trigger adverse public attention. In addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize from such actions. Any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements.We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.As of December 31, 2018, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $37.6 billion. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets, changes in the structure of our business, divestitures, market capitalization declines, or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized.Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements.Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products and services we purchase overseas. Sales and expenses of our non-U.S. businesses are also translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects. In addition, certain of our businesses may invoice customers in a currency other than the business’ functional currency, and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable translation effects. The Company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries.Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was enacted. The TCJA significantly revised the U.S. federal corporate income tax law by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate to 21.0%, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time tax on unremitted cumulative non-U.S. earnings of foreign subsidiaries (“Transition Tax”). The U.S. Treasury Department and IRS continue to issue regulations with respect to implementing the TCJA and further regulations are expected to be issued.Due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the TCJA), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our intercompany arrangements, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, our estimates of effective tax rate and income tax assets and liabilities may be incorrect and our financial statements could be adversely affected; please refer to MD&A for a discussion of additional factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period. The impact of these factors referenced in the first sentence of this paragraph may be substantially different from period-to-period. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities, such as the audits described in MD&A and the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. If audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to 20our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected. Any further significant changes to the tax system in the United States or in other jurisdictions (including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below) could adversely affect our financial statements.Changes in tax law relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect our tax position.The U.S. Congress, government agencies in non-U.S. jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting,” where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in low-tax jurisdictions, or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. The OECD has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for addressing base erosion and profit shifting. As a result, the tax laws in the United States and other countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect our business and financial statements.We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our business and financial statements.We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims or counterclaims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, breach of contract claims, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiture-related matters, as well as regulatory subpoenas, requests for information, investigations and enforcement. We may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, divested businesses. The types of claims made in lawsuits include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages (and in some cases, treble damages) and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. In addition, developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. We cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and business. However, based on our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2018 will have a material effect on our financial statements.If we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third-parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.Many of the markets we serve are technology-driven, and as a result intellectual property rights play a significant role in product development and differentiation. We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our business. The intellectual property rights that we obtain, however, may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. In addition, the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented, designed-around or becoming subject to compulsory licensing, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons, or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third-parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business, including our competitive position, and financial statements.21Third-parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.From time to time, we receive notices from third-parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. Any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to critical technology, be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services, be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our business, including our competitive position, and financial statements. Even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.The U.S. government has certain rights to use and disclose some of the intellectual property that we license and could exclusively license it to a third-party if we fail to achieve practical application of the intellectual property.Certain technology licensed by us under agreements with third-party licensors may be subject to government rights. Government rights in inventions conceived or reduced to practice under a government-funded program may include a nonexclusive, royalty-free worldwide license to practice or have practiced such inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the U.S. government has the right to require us or our licensors (as applicable) to grant licenses which would be exclusive under any of such inventions to a third-party if they determine that: (1) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize such inventions in a particular field of use; (2) such action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (3) such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations. Further, the government rights include the right to use and disclose, without limitation, technical data relating to licensed technology that was developed in whole or in part at government expense.Defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products or services (including software), or allegations thereof, could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.Manufacturing or design defects or “bugs” in, unanticipated use of, safety or quality issues (or the perception of such issues) with respect to, “off label” use of, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell (including items that we source from third-parties) can lead to personal injury, death, property damage, loss of profits or other liability. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts, result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us. Recalls, removals and product liability and similar claims (regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome) can result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. Our business can also be affected by studies of the utilization, safety and efficacy of medical device products and components that are conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. Any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of product issues, including claims by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class.The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products, our reputation, business and financial statements could suffer.The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters and environmental factors, and if not discovered before the product is released to market could result in recalls and product liability exposure. Because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities and other stringent regulations of the FDA and similar agencies regarding the manufacture of certain of our products, an alternative manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity. Any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant costs, liability and lost revenue, loss of market share as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products.Our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow, and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements.As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $9.7 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had the ability to incur approximately an additional $1.5 billion of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facility based on the amounts available under the Company’s $4.0 billion credit facility which 22were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances. Our debt level and related debt service obligations can have negative consequences, including (1) requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and capital investment; (2) reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and (3) exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. We may incur significantly more debt in the future, particularly to finance acquisitions, and there can be no assurance that our cost of funding will not substantially increase.Our current revolving credit facility and long-term debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us; for more information refer to MD&A. If we breach any of these restrictions and cannot obtain a waiver from the lenders on favorable terms, subject to applicable cure periods, the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements. In addition, any failure to maintain the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies would adversely affect our cost of funds and could adversely affect our liquidity and access to the capital markets. If we add new debt, the risks described above could increase.Adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition, performance, purchasing patterns or inventory levels of, key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements.Certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to or through key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and end-users. Some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products or compete with us directly, and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. Adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners, reduction or discontinuation of their purchases from us or adverse developments in their financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns, could adversely affect our business and financial statements. The levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners, and changes in those levels, can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period. In addition, the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries could adversely impact our business and financial statements.Certain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other third-parties for development, supply and marketing of certain products and potential products, and such collaborative partners or other third-parties could fail to perform sufficiently.We believe that for certain of our businesses, success in penetrating target markets depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies. Relying on collaborative relationships is risky because, among other things, our collaborative partners may (1) not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations; (2) fail to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner; (3) be acquired by other companies and terminate our collaborative partnership or become insolvent; (4) compete with us; (5) disagree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship; (6) have insufficient capital resources; and (7) decline to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms. Because these and other factors may be beyond our control, the development or commercialization of our products involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. If we or any of our collaborative partners terminate a collaborative arrangement, we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or we may need to cancel some development programs, which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations.As discussed in “Item 1. Business—Materials,” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components, raw materials and other commodities, including metallic-based components, electronic components, chemicals, plastics and other petroleum-based products. Prices for and availability of these components, raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past. Any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business. In addition, due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve, the cost-containment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to, if commodity prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions, or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs, our margins and profitability could decline and our financial statements could be adversely affected.23If we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand, our profitability may suffer. In addition, our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials, components and services could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies.We purchase materials, components and equipment from third-parties for use in our manufacturing operations, including metallic-based components, electronic components, chemicals, plastics and other petroleum-based products. Our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations, including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality. During a market upturn, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices. If we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand, we may not be able to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed, our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities. Conversely, in order to secure supplies for the production of products, we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer.In addition, some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, regulatory requirements, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. If these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, war, terrorist actions, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes. Any of these factors could result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies.Because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements. Any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our financial statements.Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses.We compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional regulations, such as regulations governing health and safety, the environment, food and drugs, privacy and electronic communications. We develop, configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. Any significant change in any of these regulations (or in the interpretation or application thereof) could reduce demand for, increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services, or could restrict our existing activities, products and services. For example, a number of our products and services are marketed to the pharmaceutical and related industries for use in discovering and developing drugs and therapies. Changes in the U.S. FDA’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products and services. In addition, in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations. In these markets, the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations, the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address or the repeal of existing regulations, could adversely affect demand. In addition, regulatory deadlines may result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period-to-period.Work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations.We have certain U.S. and non-U.S. collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our financial statements and business, including our productivity and reputation.24International economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements.In 2018, approximately 63% of our sales were derived from customers outside the United States. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located outside the United States. Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the United States and increase the localization of our products and services, we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the United States, particularly in the high-growth markets. Our international business (and particularly our business in high-growth markets) is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations, including:•interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers; •differences in terms of sale, including payment terms;•local product preferences and product requirements;•changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, such as the devaluation of particular currencies;•trade protection measures, embargoes and import or export restrictions and requirements;•unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws;•capital controls and limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash;•the potential for nationalization of enterprises;•changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs;•limitations on legal rights and our ability to enforce such rights;•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;•differing labor regulations;•difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis; •differing protection of intellectual property; and•greater uncertainty, risk, expense and delay in commercializing products in certain foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to product and other regulatory approvals.Any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and business, including our growth rate.Significant developments stemming from the United Kingdom’s referendum decision to exit the EU could have an adverse effect on us.In a referendum on June 23, 2016, voters in the United Kingdom (“UK”) voted for the UK to exit the EU (referred to as Brexit). As it stands, the UK is expected to depart the EU on March 29, 2019 but the terms of its withdrawal and the nature of its future relationship with the EU are still being decided. This referendum has caused and may continue to cause political and economic uncertainty, including significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Even if no agreement is reached, the UK’s separation still becomes effective unless all EU members unanimously agree on an extension. Negotiations have commenced to determine the future terms of the UK relationship with the EU, including, among other things, the terms of trade between the UK and the EU. If no agreement is reached by March 29, 2019, the UK’s membership in the EU could terminate under a so-called “hard Brexit”. The effects of Brexit will depend on many factors, including any agreements that the UK makes to retain access to EU markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. In a “hard Brexit” scenario, there could be increased costs from re-imposition of tariffs on trade between the UK and EU, shipping delays because of the need for customs inspections and procedures, and temporary shortages of certain goods. In addition, trade and investment between the UK, the EU, the United States and other countries will be impacted by the fact that the UK currently operates under the EU’s tax treaties. The UK will need to negotiate its own tax and trade treaties with countries all over the world, which could take years to complete. We have manufacturing facilities in the UK, and, depending on the terms of Brexit, we could become subject to export tariffs and regulatory restrictions that could increase the costs and time related to doing business in Europe. Additionally, Brexit could result in the UK or the European Union significantly altering its regulations affecting the clearance or approval of our products 25that are developed or manufactured in the UK. Any new regulations could add time and expense to the conduct of our business, as well as the process by which our products receive regulatory approval in the UK, the EU and elsewhere. Any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial statements. As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s net investment in plant, property and equipment in the UK was $157 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, less than 3% of our sales were derived from customers located in the UK, however, the impact of Brexit could also impact our sales and operations outside the UK.If we suffer loss to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed.Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, public health crisis, war, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters, such as the damage caused to our facilities by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in September 2017. If any of these facilities, supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses. The third-party insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against such losses.Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements.The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets, investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNot applicable.ITEM 2. PROPERTIESDanaher’s corporate headquarters are located in Washington, D.C. in a facility that the Company leases. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had facilities in over 60 countries, including approximately 261 significant office, research and development, manufacturing and distribution facilities. 109 of these facilities are located in the United States in over 25 states and 152 are located outside the United States in over 30 other countries, primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia, South America, the rest of North America and Australia. These facilities cover approximately 23 million square feet, of which approximately 11 million square feet are owned and approximately 12 million square feet are leased. Particularly outside the United States, facilities often serve more than one business segment and may be used for multiple purposes, such as administrative, sales, manufacturing, warehousing and/or distribution. In addition to three significant corporate locations, the number of significant administrative, sales, research and development, manufacturing and distribution facilities by business segment is:•Life Sciences, 80;•Diagnostics, 75;•Dental, 42; and•Environmental & Applied Solutions, 61.The Company considers its facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used and does not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. The Company believes its properties and equipment have been well-maintained.

MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIESOur common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol DHR. As of February 7, 2019, there were approximately 2,500 holders of record of Danaher’s common stock. Our payment of dividends in the future will be determined by Danaher’s Board of Directors and will depend on business conditions, Danaher’s earnings and other factors Danaher’s Board deems relevant.Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesOn July 16, 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”) authorizing the repurchase of up to 20 million shares of the Company’s common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. There is no expiration date for the Repurchase Program, and the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will be determined by the Company’s management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Company’s equity compensation plans (or any successor plan) and for other corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2018, 20 million shares remained available for repurchase pursuant to the Repurchase Program. The Company expects to fund any future stock repurchases using the Company’s available cash balances or proceeds from the issuance of debt.Neither the Company nor any “affiliated purchaser” repurchased any shares of Company common stock during 2018, 2017 or 2016. Recent Issuances of Unregistered SecuritiesDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, holders of certain of the Company’s Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2021 (“LYONs”) converted such LYONs into an aggregate of 97 thousand shares of Danaher common stock, par value $0.01 per share. In each case, the shares of common stock were issued solely to existing security holders upon conversion of the LYONs pursuant to the exemption from registration provided under Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.29Table of ContentsITEM 6.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide a reader of Danaher’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of Company management. The Company’s MD&A is divided into five sections:•Overview•Results of Operations•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Critical Accounting Estimates•New Accounting StandardsThis discussion and analysis should be read along with Danaher’s audited financial statements and related Notes thereto as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 included in this Annual Report.OVERVIEWGeneralRefer to “Item 1. Business—General” for a discussion of Danaher’s strategic objectives and methodologies for delivering long-term shareholder value. Danaher is a multinational business with global operations. During 2018, approximately 63% of Danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the United States. As a diversified, global business, Danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors. Danaher’s geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of its products, software and services, help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. Given the broad range of products manufactured, software and services provided and geographies served, management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the Company. The Company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.As a result of the Company’s geographic and industry diversity, the Company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges, including rapid technological development (particularly with respect to computing, automation, artificial intelligence, mobile connectivity, communications and digitization) in most of the Company’s served markets, the expansion and evolution of opportunities in high-growth markets, trends and costs associated with a global labor force, consolidation of the Company’s competitors and increasing regulation. The Company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and the Company’s long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in high-growth geographies and high-growth market segments, identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative and differentiated new products and services with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of the Company’s sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated global environment. The Company is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources (particularly in high-growth markets) in order to be responsive to the Company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the Company’s operations.Business PerformanceConsolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased 8.5% as compared to 2017. While differences exist among the Company’s businesses, on an overall basis, demand for the Company’s products and services increased on a year-over-year basis in 2018 as compared to 2017. This demand, together with the Company’s continued investments in sales growth initiatives and the other business-specific factors discussed below, contributed to year-over-year core sales growth of 6.0% (for the definition of “core sales,” refer to “—Results of Operations” below). Geographically, both high-growth and developed markets contributed to year-over-year core sales growth during 2018. Core sales growth rates in high-growth markets grew at a high-single digit rate in 2018 as compared to 2017 led by strength in Asia, particularly China. High-growth markets represented approximately 31% of the Company’s total sales in 2018. Core sales in developed markets grew at a mid-single digit rate in 2018 as compared to 2017 and were driven by North America and Western Europe. 31Table of ContentsThe Company’s net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled approximately $2.7 billion, or $3.74 per diluted share, compared to approximately $2.5 billion, or $3.50 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2017.The Company recorded a net increase to beginning retained earnings of $3 million as of January 1, 2018 due to the cumulative impact of adopting Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The impact to beginning retained earnings was primarily driven by the capitalization of certain costs to obtain a contract, primarily sales-related commissions, partially offset by the deferral of revenue for unfulfilled performance obligations. The adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 and, as a result, comparisons of revenues and operating profit performance between periods are not affected by the adoption of this ASU. Refer to Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.AcquisitionsDuring 2018, the Company acquired two businesses for total consideration of approximately $2.2 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of the Company’s Life Sciences and Environmental & Applied Solutions segments. The aggregate annual sales of these two businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $313 million. For a discussion of the Company’s 2017 and 2016 acquisition and disposition activity, refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Investing Activities”.Fortive Separation and Proposed Dental SeparationOn July 2, 2016, Danaher completed the Separation of its former Test & Measurement segment, Industrial Technologies segment (excluding the product identification businesses) and retail/commercial petroleum business by distributing to Danaher stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Fortive, the entity Danaher incorporated to hold such businesses. To effect the Fortive Separation, Danaher distributed to its stockholders one share of Fortive common stock for every two shares of Danaher common stock outstanding as of June 15, 2016, the record date for the distribution.During the second quarter of 2016, the Company received net cash distributions of approximately $3.0 billion from Fortive as consideration for the Company’s contribution of assets to Fortive in connection with the Separation (“Fortive Distribution”). Danaher used a portion of the cash distribution proceeds to repay the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.3% senior unsecured notes that matured in June 2016 and to redeem approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness in August 2016 (consisting of the Company’s 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2018, 5.4% senior unsecured notes due 2019 and 3.9% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (collectively the “Redeemed Notes”)). Danaher also paid an aggregate of $188 million in make-whole premiums in connection with the August 2016 redemptions, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company used the balance of the Fortive Distribution to fund certain of the Company’s regular, quarterly cash dividends to shareholders. The accounting requirements for reporting the Fortive Separation as a discontinued operation were met when the separation was completed. Accordingly, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented reflect this business as a discontinued operation. The Company allocated a portion of the consolidated interest expense and income to discontinued operations based on the ratio of the discontinued business’ net assets to the Company’s consolidated net assets. Fortive had revenues of approximately $3.0 billion in 2016 prior to the Fortive Separation. As a result of the Fortive Separation, the Company incurred $48 million in Fortive Separation-related costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 which are included in earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Earnings. These Fortive Separation costs primarily relate to professional fees associated with preparation of regulatory filings and Separation activities within finance, tax, legal and information system functions as well as certain investment banking fees incurred upon the Fortive Separation. In 2017, Danaher recorded a $22 million income tax benefit related to the release of previously provided reserves associated with uncertain tax positions on certain Danaher tax returns which were jointly filed with Fortive entities. These reserves were released due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for those returns. All Fortive entity-related balances were included in the income tax benefit related to discontinued operations.In July 2018, the Company announced its intention to spin-off its Dental business into an independent publicly-traded company. The transaction is expected to be tax-free to the Company’s shareholders. The Company is targeting to complete the Dental Separation in the second half of 2019, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including obtaining final 32Table of Contentsapproval from the Danaher Board of Directors, satisfactory completion of financing, receipt of tax opinions, receipt of favorable rulings from the IRS and receipt of other regulatory approvals. Sale of InvestmentsFor a discussion of the Company’s 2017 and 2016 sales of investments activity, refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Investing Activities”.U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs ActOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted, which substantially changed the U.S. tax system, including lowering the corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% (beginning in 2018). As a result of the TCJA, the Company recognized a provisional tax liability of approximately $1.2 billion in 2017 for the Transition Tax, which, after the application of available tax credits of approximately $1.0 billion, is payable over a period of eight years. The net Transition Tax payable as of December 31, 2018 of approximately $180 million is not expected to significantly impact the Company’s cash flows from operations. The Company also remeasured U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the income tax rates at which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to reverse in the future (generally 21.0%), resulting in an income tax benefit of approximately $1.2 billion. In 2018, the Company recorded an additional charge related to finalizing the provisional accounting for the enactment of the TCJA of $6 million. For further discussion of the TCJA, refer to “—Income Taxes.”UK’s referendum decision to exit the EU (“Brexit”)In a referendum on June 23, 2016, voters approved for the UK to exit the EU and the UK is expected to depart the EU on March 29, 2019. With the terms of the UK’s withdrawal and the nature of its future relationship with the EU still being decided, the Company continues to monitor the status of the negotiations and plan for any impact. The ultimate impact of Brexit on the Company’s financial results is uncertain. For additional information, refer to the “Item 1A—Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report. RESULTS OF OPERATIONSIn this report, references to the non-GAAP measure of core sales (also referred to as core revenues or sales/revenues from existing businesses) refer to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) but excluding:•sales from acquired businesses; and•the impact of currency translation.References to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales and operating profit, as applicable, attributable to divested product lines not considered discontinued operations. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between:•the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses); and•the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period.Core sales growth should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting the non-GAAP financial measure of core sales growth provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in Danaher’s business and facilitating comparisons of Danaher’s revenue performance with its performance in prior and future periods and to Danaher’s peers. Management also uses core sales growth to measure the Company’s operating and financial performance. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from core sales because currency translation is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestiture-related items because the nature, size, timing and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period-to-period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.Throughout this discussion, references to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales and references to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies resulting from the ongoing application of DBS.33Table of ContentsCore Revenue 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016Total sales growth (GAAP)8.5 %8.5 %Less the impact of: Acquisitions and other(2.0)% (4.5)%Currency exchange rates (0.5)% (0.5)%Core revenue growth (non-GAAP)6.0 % 3.5 %Core sales grew on a year-over-year basis in both 2018 and 2017. Sales from acquired businesses increased on a year-over-year basis in 2018 due primarily to the acquisition of IDT in the second quarter of 2018 and in 2017 due primarily to the acquisition of Cepheid in the fourth quarter of 2016. Currency translation increased reported sales on a year-over-year basis in 2018 primarily due to the U.S. dollar weakening against other major currencies in the first half of 2018, partially offset by the U.S. dollar strengthening in the second half of 2018. Currency translation increased reported sales on a year-over-year basis in 2017 primarily due to the U.S. dollar weakening against the euro, partially offset by the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi.Operating profit margins were 17.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 16.3% in 2017. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.2018 vs. 2017 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by: •Higher 2018 sales volumes from existing businesses and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2018 and 2017, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments and the impact of foreign exchange rates - 70 basis points•Restructuring, impairment and other related charges related to discontinuing a product line in the second quarter of 2017 related to the Diagnostic segment - 40 basis points •Trade name impairments and related productivity improvement initiatives in 2017 related to the Dental segment - 5 basis points 2018 vs. 2017 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:•The incremental net dilutive effect in 2018 of acquired businesses - 20 basis points•Costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to the anticipated separation of the Dental business - 5 basis points•Acquisition-related charges consisting of transaction costs and fair value adjustments to inventory for the acquisition of IDT in the second quarter of 2018 - 10 basis pointsOperating profit margins were 16.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 16.2% in 2016.

Core sales of the business’ broad range of mass spectrometers continued to grow on a year-over-year basis led by strong sales growth in high-growth markets, particularly China and the rest of Asia, and in North America. This growth was led by demand in the clinical, applied and pharmaceutical end-markets and by demand for service offerings. Core sales of microscopy products continued to grow on a year-over-year basis with growth in demand across most major end-markets partially driven by recent new product releases. Geographically, demand for microscopy products increased in North America and high-growth markets, particularly China. Year-over-year core sales for the business’ flow cytometry and particle counting products 35Table of Contentscontinued to grow in 2018 across most major end-markets, led by increases in sales in North America, China and Western Europe. New product launches in 2018 also contributed to the increased demand in these markets.

Cost of goods sold also increased as a result of tariffs in 2018, and tariffs are estimated to have a modest impact on cost of goods sold in 2019.The year-over-year increase in cost of sales during 2017 as compared with 2016, is due primarily to the impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, including sales from recently acquired businesses and the impact of restructuring, impairment and other related charges associated with the Company’s strategic decision to discontinue a product line in its Diagnostics segment. This increase in cost of sales was partially offset by year-over-year cost savings at recently acquired businesses, incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continued productivity improvement actions taken in 2017 and 2016, and the year-over-year decrease in acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory which decreased cost of sales by $21 million during 2017 as compared to 2016.The year-over-year increase in gross profit margins during 2018 as compared with 2017 is due primarily to the favorable impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, including sales from recently acquired businesses, increased leverage of certain manufacturing costs and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continuing productivity improvements taken in 2018 and 2017. Gross margin improvements were partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates in 2018.The year-over-year increase in gross profit margins during 2017 as compared with 2016 is due primarily to the favorable impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continuing productivity improvements taken in 2017 and 2016. In addition, the acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue were higher in 2016 than 2017, which improved gross profit margins by 10 basis points during 2017 as compared with 2016.42Table of ContentsOPERATING EXPENSES For the Year Ended December 31($ in millions)2018 2017 2016Sales$19,893.0 $18,329.7 $16,882.4Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses(6,472.1) (6,073.3) (5,624.3)Research and development (“R&D”) expenses(1,231.2) (1,128.8) (975.1)SG&A as a % of sales32.5% 33.1% 33.3%R&D as a % of sales6.2% 6.2% 5.8%SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales declined 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2018 compared with 2017. The decline was driven by increased leverage of the Company’s general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2018 sales volumes, continuing productivity improvements taken in 2018 and 2017, and the impact of the restructuring, impairment and other related charges incurred in 2017 associated with the Company’s strategic decision to discontinue a product line in its Diagnostics segment. The decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales was partially offset by higher relative spending levels at recently acquired companies and continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales declined 20 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2017 compared with 2016. The decline was driven by increased leverage of the Company’s general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2017 sales volumes, continuing productivity improvements taken in 2017 and 2016 as well as the benefit of lower acquisition charges in 2017 compared to 2016, particularly change in control payments and restructuring costs in connection with the acquisition of Cepheid. The decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales was partially offset by restructuring, impairment and other related charges associated with the Company’s strategic decision to discontinue a product line in its Diagnostics segment, higher relative spending levels at recently acquired companies, primarily Cepheid, and continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives. R&D expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) as a percentage of sales remained consistent in 2018 as compared with 2017 as year-over-year increases in spending in the Company’s new product development initiatives corresponded to the increase in sales. R&D expenses as a percentage of sales increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 due primarily to higher R&D expenses as a percentage of sales in the businesses most recently acquired, primarily Cepheid, as well as year-over-year increases in spending in the Company’s new product development initiatives.NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) As described in Note 1 and Note 11, in the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation— Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. The ASU requires the Company to disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net periodic benefit costs and requires the Company to present the other components of net periodic benefit cost in other income, net. The ASU also requires application on a retrospective basis. The other components of net periodic benefit costs included in other income, net for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were net gains of $37 million, $31 million and $16 million, respectively.During 2017, the Company received $138 million of cash proceeds and recorded $22 million in short-term other receivables from the sale of certain marketable equity securities during 2017. The Company recorded a pretax gain related to this sale of $73 million ($46 million after-tax or $0.06 per diluted share).During 2016, the Company received cash proceeds of $265 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and recorded a pretax gain related to this sale of $223 million ($140 million after-tax or $0.20 per diluted share). During 2016, the Company also paid $188 million of make-whole premiums associated with the early extinguishment of the Redeemed Notes. The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of these borrowings, net of certain deferred gains, of $179 million ($112 million after-tax or $0.16 per diluted share). INTEREST COSTSInterest expense of $157 million for 2018 was $5 million lower than in 2017, due primarily to the decrease in interest costs as a result of the repayment of certain outstanding borrowings in the third quarter of 2018 and the second and fourth quarters of 2017, lower average outstanding U.S. commercial paper borrowings during 2018 compared to 2017, and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates in 2018 as compared to 2017, partially offset by the cost of additional non-U.S. debt issued during 43Table of Contents2017. For a further description of the Company’s debt as of December 31, 2018 refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest expense of $163 million in 2017 was $21 million lower than the 2016 interest expense of $184 million due primarily to the decrease in interest costs as a result of the early extinguishment of certain outstanding borrowings in the third quarter of 2016 using the proceeds from the Fortive Distribution and lower commercial paper borrowings in 2017 compared to 2016, partially offset by the cost of additional long-term debt refinancing relating to the acquisition of Cepheid. In January 2019, the Company entered into approximately $1.9 billion of cross-currency swap derivative contracts on its U.S. dollar-denominated bonds to effectively convert the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bonds to obligations denominated in Danish kroner, Japanese yen, euro and Swiss franc. Based on the interest rates of the swaps and current currency exchange rates, the Company expects these contracts to effectively reduce the Company’s interest expense in 2019 by approximately $35 million versus the stated interest rates on the U.S. dollar denominated debt. INCOME TAXESGeneralIncome tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.The Company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws and regulations, including the TCJA and legislative policy changes that may result from the OECD’s initiative on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. For a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, refer to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash and Cash Requirements” below.The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis. Based on these reviews, the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities, tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations, reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary. For a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted, substantially changing the U.S. tax system and affecting the Company in a number of ways. Notably, the TCJA: •established a flat corporate income tax rate of 21.0% on U.S. earnings; •imposed a one-time tax on unremitted cumulative non-U.S. earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which we refer to in this Annual Report as the Transition Tax; •imposes a new minimum tax on certain non-U.S. earnings, irrespective of the territorial system of taxation, and generally allows for the repatriation of future earnings of foreign subsidiaries without incurring additional U.S. taxes by transitioning to a territorial system of taxation; •subjects certain payments made by a U.S. company to a related foreign company to certain minimum taxes (Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax); •eliminated certain prior tax incentives for manufacturing in the United States and creates an incentive for U.S. companies to sell, lease or license goods and services abroad by allowing for a reduction in taxes owed on earnings related to such sales; •allows the cost of investments in certain depreciable assets acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017 to be immediately expensed; and •reduces deductions with respect to certain compensation paid to specified executive officers. While the changes from the TCJA were generally effective beginning in 2018, GAAP accounting for income taxes requires the effect of a change in tax laws or rates to be recognized in income from continuing operations for the period that includes the enactment date. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of the TCJA, SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB No. 118”) allowed the Company to record provisional amounts in earnings for the year ended December 31, 44Table of Contents2017. Where reasonable estimates could be made, the provisional accounting was based on such estimates. When no reasonable estimate could be made, SAB No. 118 required the accounting to be based on the tax law in effect before the TCJA. The Company was required to complete its tax accounting for the TCJA when it had obtained, prepared and analyzed the information to complete the income tax accounting but no later than December 22, 2018. Accordingly, during 2018, the Company completed its accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the TCJA based on the Company’s interpretation of the new tax regulations and related guidance issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the IRS. •The Transition Tax is based on the Company’s post-1986 earnings and profits that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. In the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a provision amount for the Transition Tax expense resulting in an increase in income tax expense of approximately $1.2 billion. During 2018, the Company finalized the calculations of the Transition Tax liability and increased the provisional amount recorded in 2017 by $40 million, with the increase included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations in 2018. Regulations allow the Company to reduce the Transition Tax payable by applying available foreign tax credits and other tax attributes. The Company has elected to pay the net Transition Tax payable over an eight-year period as permitted by the TCJA. As of December 31, 2018, the remaining Transition Tax balance to be paid over the next seven years is approximately $180 million.•In connection with finalizing the calculation of tax credits available to reduce the Transition Tax and other U.S. taxable income, the Company recorded an additional provision of $13 million related to net unrealizable credits which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations in 2018. •U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities were remeasured as of December 31, 2017 based upon the tax rates at which the assets and liabilities are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21.0%, resulting in an income tax benefit of approximately $1.2 billion in 2017. Upon finalizing the provisional accounting for the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities in 2018, the Company recorded an additional tax benefit of $47 million, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. •The TCJA imposes tax on U.S. shareholders for global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company is required to make an accounting policy election of either: (1) treating taxes due on future amounts included in U.S. taxable income related to GILTI as a current period tax expense when incurred (the “period cost method”); or (2) factoring such amounts into the Company’s measurement of its deferred tax expense (the “deferred method”). As of December 31, 2017, the Company was still analyzing its global income and did not record a GILTI-related deferred tax amount. In 2018, the Company elected the period cost method for its accounting for GILTI. Due to the complexity and recent issuance of these tax regulations, management’s interpretations of the impact of these rules could be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities.Year-Over-Year Changes in the Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016Effective tax rate from continuing operations19.5% 16.0% 17.5%The Company’s effective tax rate for 2018, 2017 and 2016 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rates of 21.0% for 2018 and 35.0% for 2017 and 2016, due principally to the Company’s earnings outside the United States that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates different than the U.S. federal statutory rate. In addition: •The effective tax rate of 19.5% in 2018 includes 70 basis points of tax benefits primarily related to the release of reserves upon the expiration of statutes of limitation, audit settlements and release of valuation allowance in a certain foreign tax jurisdiction. These tax benefits were partially offset by additional provisions related to completing the accounting for the enactment of the TCJA as summarized above and tax costs directly related to reorganization activities associated with preparing for the Dental Separation.•The effective tax rate of 16.0% in 2017 includes 500 basis points of net tax benefits due to the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities from 35.0% to 21.0% due to the TCJA and the release of reserves upon statute of limitation expiration, partially offset by income tax expense related to the Transition Tax on foreign earnings due to the TCJA and changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions. 45Table of Contents•The effective tax rate of 17.5% in 2016 includes 350 basis points of net tax benefits from permanent foreign exchange losses and the release of reserves upon the expiration of statutes of limitation and audit settlements, partially offset by income tax expense related to repatriation of earnings and legal entity realignments associated with the Fortive Separation and changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions.The Company conducts business globally, and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. The non-U.S. countries in which the Company has a significant presence include China, Denmark, Germany, Singapore, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The Company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements given the geographic dispersion of the Company’s taxable income. The Company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities. The IRS has completed substantially all of the examinations of the Company’s federal income tax returns through 2011 and is currently examining certain of the Company’s federal income tax returns for 2012 through 2015. In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and various other countries, states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2004 through 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the IRS proposed significant adjustments to the Company’s taxable income for the years 2012 through 2015 with respect to the deferral of tax on certain premium income related to the Company’s self-insurance programs. The proposed adjustments would increase the Company’s taxable income over the 2012 through 2015 period by approximately $960 million. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, the IRS has notified the Company that it is considering additional taxable income adjustments related to other aspects of the Company’s self-insurance programs for the years 2012 through 2015. These additional proposed adjustments would increase the Company’s taxable income by approximately $1.7 billion. Management believes the positions the Company has taken in its U.S. tax returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws, intends to vigorously defend these positions and is currently considering all of its alternatives. Due to the enactment of the TCJA in 2017 and the resulting reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate for years after 2017, the Company revalued its deferred tax liabilities related to the temporary differences associated with this deferred premium income from 35.0% to 21.0%. If the Company is not successful in defending these assessments, the taxes owed to the IRS may be computed under the previous 35.0% statutory tax rate and the Company may be required to revalue the related deferred tax liabilities from 21.0% to 35.0%, which in addition to any interest due on the amounts assessed, would require a charge to future earnings. The ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, could take many years and could result in a material adverse impact to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, including its cash flows and effective tax rate. Tax authorities in Denmark have raised significant issues related to interest accrued by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. On December 10, 2013, the Company received assessments from the Danish tax authority (“SKAT”) totaling approximately DKK 1.6 billion (approximately $247 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2018) including interest through December 31, 2018, imposing withholding tax relating to interest accrued in Denmark on borrowings from certain of the Company’s subsidiaries for the years 2004 through 2009. The Company is currently in discussions with SKAT and anticipates receiving an assessment for years 2010 through 2012 totaling approximately DKK 954 million (approximately $146 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2018) including interest through December 31, 2018. Management believes the positions the Company has taken in Denmark are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and is vigorously defending its positions. The Company appealed these assessments with the National Tax Tribunal in 2014 and intends on pursuing this matter through the European Court of Justice should this appeal be unsuccessful. The ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, could take many years, and could result in a material adverse impact to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, including its cash flows and effective tax rate. After considering the effect of the TCJA, the Company expects its 2019 effective tax rate to be approximately 19.5%. Any future legislative changes in the United States including new regulations related to the TCJA or potential tax reform in other jurisdictions, could cause the Company’s effective tax rate to differ from this estimate. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to income taxes.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS As further discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, discontinued operations include the results of the Fortive businesses which were disposed of during the third quarter of 2016. In 2017, Danaher recorded a $22 million income tax benefit related to the release of previously provided reserves associated with uncertain tax positions on certain Danaher tax returns which were jointly filed with Fortive entities. These reserves were released due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for those returns. All Fortive entity-related balances were included in 46Table of Contentsthe income tax benefit related to discontinued operations. In 2016, earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, were $400 million and reflected the operating results of the Fortive businesses prior to the Fortive Separation. COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEComprehensive income decreased by approximately $1.5 billion in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to a loss from foreign currency translation adjustments in 2018 compared to a gain in 2017 and a loss from pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments as compared to a gain in 2017, partially offset by higher net earnings from continuing operations and a decrease in unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities in 2018 compared to 2017. The Company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $632 million for 2018 compared to a translation gain of $976 million for 2017. The Company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit loss of $13 million for 2018 compared to a gain of $71 million for 2017. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher net earnings in 2018 compared to 2017.Comprehensive income increased by approximately $1.7 billion in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to increased earnings from continuing operations, an increased gain from foreign currency translation adjustments compared to 2016, pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments and the decrease in unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities, partially offset by lower net earnings attributable to discontinued operations in 2017 compared to 2016. The Company recorded a foreign currency translation gain of $976 million for 2017 compared to a translation loss of $517 million for 2016. The Company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit gain of $71 million in 2017 compared to a loss of $58 million in 2016.INFLATIONThe effect of inflation on the Company’s revenues and net earnings was not significant in any of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016.FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENTThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices as well as credit risk, each of which could impact its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. The Company may periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign exchange risks. In addition, the Company’s broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole.Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. A change in interest rates on long-term debt impacts the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt but not the Company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2018, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt (excluding the LYONs, which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from the value of its underlying common stock) by $460 million.As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s variable-rate debt obligations consisted primarily of U.S. dollar and euro-based commercial paper borrowings (refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2018). As a result, the Company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term interest rates. As these shorter duration obligations mature, the Company may issue additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. In 2018, the average annual interest rate associated with outstanding commercial paper borrowings was approximately negative 18 basis points. A hypothetical increase of this average to negative eight basis points would have increased the Company’s annual interest expense by $3 million. The hypothetical increase used is the actual amount by which the Company’s commercial paper interest rates fluctuated during 2018.In January 2019, the Company entered into approximately $1.9 billion of cross-currency swap derivative contracts on its U.S. dollar denominated bonds to effectively convert the Company’s U.S. dollar denominated bonds to obligations denominated in Danish kroner, Japanese yen, euro and Swiss franc. Based on the interest rates of the swaps and current currency exchange 47Table of Contentsrates, the Company expects these contracts to reduce the Company’s interest expense in 2019 by approximately $35 million versus the stated interest rates on the U.S. dollar denominated debt. Currency Exchange Rate RiskThe Company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than Danaher’s functional currency or the functional currency of its applicable subsidiary. The Company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign operations into U.S. dollars, Danaher’s functional currency. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the Company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of stockholders’ equity. Currency exchange rates positively impacted 2018 reported sales by 0.5% on a year-over-year basis, primarily as a result of the U.S. dollar weakening against other major currencies in the first half of 2018. The U.S. dollar strengthened in the second half of 2018 which mitigated some of the benefit recorded in early 2018. If the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2018 were to prevail throughout 2019, currency exchange rates would adversely impact 2019 estimated sales by 1.5% relative to the Company’s performance in 2018. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would adversely impact the Company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis. Any weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would positively impact the Company’s sales and results of operations.The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this transactional exchange risk. Both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales and net earnings in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, the Company has assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies. The Company may also use foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2018 would have reduced foreign currency-denominated net assets and stockholders’ equity by $860 million. In 2019, the Company entered into approximately $1.9 billion of cross-currency swap derivative contracts on its U.S. dollar-denominated bonds to hedge its net investment in foreign operations against adverse changes in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Danish kroner, Japanese yen, euro and the Swiss franc. These contracts effectively convert the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bonds to obligations denominated in Danish kroner, Japanese yen, euro and Swiss franc, and will partially offset the impact of changes in currency rates on foreign currency-denominated net assets in future periods. Equity Price RiskThe Company’s investment portfolio has in the past included publicly-traded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price. However, during 2017 the Company sold substantially all of its available-for-sale marketable equity securities. The Company also holds investments in non-marketable equity instruments in privately held companies that may be impacted by equity price risks or other factors. These non-marketable equity investments are accounted for under the Fair Value Alternative method with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. Volatility in the equity markets or other fair value considerations could affect the value of these investments and require charges or gains to be recognized in earnings. Commodity Price RiskFor a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”Credit RiskThe Company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, receivables from customers and derivatives. The Company places cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.48Table of ContentsIn addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the Company’s customers. The Company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate.The Company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and such transactions are generally insignificant to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. These transactions are typically entered into with high-quality financial institutions and exposure at any one institution is limited.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESManagement assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing requirements. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses, consummating strategic acquisitions and investments, paying interest and servicing debt and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis.Following is an overview of the Company’s cash flows and liquidity for the years ended December 31:Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity($ in millions)2018 2017 2016Total operating cash flows provided by continuing operations$4,022.0 $3,477.8 $3,087.5 Cash paid for acquisitions$(2,173.3) $(385.8) $(4,880.1)Payments for additions to property, plant and equipment(655.7) (619.6) (589.6)Proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment6.3 32.6 9.8Payments for purchases of investments(148.9) — —Proceeds from sales of investments22.2 137.9 264.8All other investing activities— (8.5) 21.9Total investing cash used in discontinued operations— — (69.8)Net cash used in investing activities$(2,949.4) $(843.4) $(5,243.0) Proceeds from the issuance of common stock$96.0 $68.8 $164.5Payment of dividends(433.4) (378.3) (399.8)Payment for purchase of noncontrolling interest— (64.4) —Make-whole premiums to redeem borrowings prior to maturity— — (188.1)Net proceeds from (repayments of) borrowings (maturities of 90 days or less)65.7 (3,778.5) 2,218.1Proceeds from borrowings (maturities longer than 90 days)— 1,782.1 3,240.9Repayments of borrowings (maturities longer than 90 days)(507.8) (668.4) (2,480.6)All other financing activities(17.9) (59.8) (27.0)Cash distributions to Fortive, net— — (485.3)Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities$(797.4) $(3,098.5) $2,042.7•Operating cash flows from continuing operations increased $544 million, or 16%, during 2018 as compared to 2017, due primarily to higher net earnings, which included higher noncash charges for depreciation and amortization, the impact of a noncash gain from the sale of marketable equity securities in 2017, and lower cash used for funding trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable in 2018 compared to 2017. This increase was partially offset by higher cash used for payments for various employee-related liabilities, customer funding and accrued expenses during 2018.•Net cash used in investing activities during 2018 consisted primarily of cash paid for acquisitions, additions to property, plant and equipment and payments for purchases of investments. The Company acquired two businesses during 2018 for total consideration (including assumed debt and net of cash acquired) of approximately $2.2 billion. 49Table of ContentsPayments for additions to property, plant and equipment increased $36 million in 2018 compared to 2017 and included investments in operating assets, and new facilities across the Company. In addition, in 2018, the Company invested $149 million in non-marketable equity securities.•The Company repaid the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2018 U.S. Notes (plus accrued interest) upon their maturity in September 2018 using available cash and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. •As of December 31, 2018, the Company held $788 million of cash and cash equivalents.Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities and productivity improvement initiatives, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows.Operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $4.0 billion for 2018, an increase of $544 million, or 16%, as compared to 2017. The year-over-year change in operating cash flows from 2017 to 2018 was primarily attributable to the following factors:•2018 operating cash flows benefited from higher net earnings in 2018 as compared to 2017. Net earnings in 2017 also included a $73 million gain on sale of marketable equity securities for which the proceeds were reflected in the investing activities section of the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and therefore, did not contribute to operating cash flows. •Net earnings from continuing operations for 2018 reflected an increase of $69 million of depreciation and amortization expense as compared to 2017. Amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions and increased due to recently acquired businesses. Depreciation expense relates to both the Company’s manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operating-type lease arrangements and increased due primarily to the impact of increased capital expenditures. Depreciation and amortization are noncash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows.•The aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable provided $24 million in operating cash flows during 2018, compared to $243 million of operating cash flows used in 2017. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively the Company manages the cash conversion cycle, which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day it pays for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from its customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period.•The aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets, deferred income taxes and accrued expenses and other liabilities used $114 million in operating cash flows during 2018, compared to $110 million used in 2017. The timing of various employee-related liabilities, customer funding and accrued expenses drove the majority of this change.Operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $3.5 billion for 2017, an increase of $390 million, or 13%, as compared to 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in net earnings from continuing operations in 2017 as compared to 2016.Investing ActivitiesCash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures, including instruments leased to customers, cash used for investments and cash proceeds from divestitures of businesses or assets.Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $2.9 billion during 2018 compared to $843 million and approximately $5.2 billion of net cash used in 2017 and 2016, respectively.Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of Investments2018 Acquisitions and Sale of InvestmentsFor a discussion of the Company’s 2018 acquisitions refer to “—Overview.” In addition, in 2018, the Company invested $149 million in non-marketable equity securities and partnerships. The Company received cash proceeds of $22 million from the collection of short-term other receivables related to the sale of certain marketable equity securities during 2017.50Table of Contents2017 Acquisitions and Sale of InvestmentsDuring 2017, the Company acquired ten businesses for total consideration of $386 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of the Life Sciences, Dental and Environmental & Applied Solutions segments. The aggregate annual sales of these ten businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $160 million. The Company received $138 million of cash proceeds and recorded $22 million in short-term other receivables from the sale of certain marketable equity securities during 2017. The Company recorded a pretax gain related to this sale of $73 million ($46 million after-tax or $0.06 per diluted share).2016 Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of InvestmentsFor a discussion of the Company’s 2016 Separation of its former Test & Measurement segment, Industrial Technologies segment (excluding the product identification businesses) and retail/commercial petroleum business, refer to “—Overview.”On November 4, 2016, Copper Merger Sub, Inc., a California corporation and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Cepheid, a California corporation, for $53.00 per share in cash, for a total purchase price of approximately $4.0 billion, net of assumed debt and acquired cash (the “Cepheid Acquisition”). Cepheid is now part of the Company’s Diagnostics segment. Cepheid generated revenues of $539 million in 2015. The Company initially financed the Cepheid acquisition price with available cash and proceeds from the issuance of U.S. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper.In addition to the Cepheid Acquisition, during 2016 the Company acquired seven businesses for total consideration of $882 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company’s four segments. The aggregate annual sales of these seven businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $237 million.In addition, during 2016, the Company received cash proceeds of $265 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and recorded a pretax gain related to this sale of $223 million ($140 million after-tax or $0.20 per diluted share).Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development, improving information technology systems and the manufacture of instruments that are used in operating-type lease arrangements that certain of the Company’s businesses enter into with customers. Capital expenditures totaled $656 million in 2018, $620 million in 2017 and $590 million in 2016. The increase in capital spending in both 2018 and 2017 was due to increased investments in operating assets and new facilities across the Company. In 2019, the Company expects capital spending to be approximately $750 million, though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions.Financing ActivitiesCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper and other debt, issuances and repurchases of common stock, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and payments of cash dividends to shareholders. Financing activities used cash of $797 million during 2018 compared to approximately $3.1 billion of cash used during 2017. The year-over-year decrease in cash used in financing activities was due primarily to lower net repayments of commercial paper borrowings in 2018, as the Company decreased its commercial paper borrowings in 2017 after increasing commercial paper borrowings for the Cepheid acquisition. The Company issued commercial paper early in 2018 to pay for a portion of the acquisition price of IDT and repaid substantially all of such commercial paper borrowings later in 2018. The cash outflow in 2017 for the net repayment of commercial paper was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of long-term notes. In both 2018 and 2017, the Company repaid long-term debt, with slightly lower repayments in 2018 compared to 2017, as the Company repaid the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2018 U.S. Notes with accrued interest upon their maturity in September 2018. Financing activities used cash of approximately $3.1 billion during 2017 compared to approximately $2.0 billion of cash provided during 2016. Cash provided by financing activities in 2017 primarily related to higher net repayments of commercial paper borrowings in 2017 as compared to 2016 (as the Company increased its commercial paper borrowings in 2016 for the Cepheid acquisition) as well as lower proceeds from the issuance of debt in 2017 as compared to 2016. These impacts were partially offset by lower repayments of long-term debt in 2017 as compared to 2016 as the Company used a portion of the proceeds from the Fortive Distribution to repay outstanding long-term indebtedness in August 2016.51Table of ContentsTotal debt was approximately $9.7 billion and $10.5 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company had the ability to incur approximately an additional $1.5 billion of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facility based on the amounts available under the Company’s $4.0 billion credit facility which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2018. The Company has classified the 2019 Euronotes and approximately $2.5 billion of its borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs as of December 31, 2018 as long-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company had the intent and ability, as supported by availability under the Credit Facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date. As commercial paper obligations mature, the Company may issue additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. Under the Company’s U.S. and euro-denominated commercial paper program, the notes are typically issued at a discount from par, generally based on the ratings assigned to the Company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to LIBOR or EURIBOR. Additionally, the Company’s floating rate senior unsecured notes due 2022 pay interest based upon the three-month EURIBOR plus 0.3%. In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. The Company has evaluated the immediate impact of the transition from LIBOR and does not expect the transition to be material. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s financing activities and indebtedness, including the Company’s outstanding debt as of December 31, 2018, and the Company’s commercial paper program and related credit facility.Shelf Registration StatementThe Company has filed a “well-known seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance. The Company expects to use net proceeds realized by the Company from future securities sales off this shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, including without limitation repayment or refinancing of debt or other corporate obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends and/or working capital.Stock Repurchase ProgramPlease see “Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Item 5 of Part II of this Annual Report for a description of the Company’s stock repurchase program.DividendsThe Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share that was paid on January 25, 2019 to holders of record on December 28, 2018. Aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2018 were $433 million. Dividend payments were higher in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to increases in the quarterly dividend rate effective with respect to the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2017 and with respect to the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2018.Cash and Cash RequirementsAs of December 31, 2018, the Company held $788 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment-grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an approximate weighted average annual interest rate of 1.3%. Of this amount, $38 million was held within the United States and $750 million was held outside of the United States. The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments, pay interest and service debt, pay taxes and any related interest or penalties, fund its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock and support other business needs. The Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, particularly in connection with acquisitions, the Company may also borrow under its commercial paper programs or credit facility, enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper programs and/or issue debt and/or equity in the capital markets. The Company also may from time to time access the capital markets to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions.While repatriation of some cash held outside the United States may be restricted by local laws, most of the Company’s foreign cash could be repatriated to the United States. Following enactment of the TCJA and the associated Transition Tax, in general, 52Table of Contentsrepatriation of cash to the United States can be completed with no incremental U.S. tax; however, repatriation of cash could subject the Company to non-U.S. jurisdictional taxes on distributions. The cash that the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations, investments and acquisitions. The income taxes applicable to such earnings are not readily determinable. As of December 31, 2018, the Company continues to assert that principally all of its non-U.S. earnings are indefinitely reinvested and management believes that the Company has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs, including its cash needs in the United States.During 2018, the Company contributed $55 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans and $52 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2019, the Company’s cash contribution requirements for its U.S. and its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately $10 million and $50 million, respectively. The ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan’s funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates and other factors.Contractual ObligationsThe following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 under (1) debt obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amounts presented in the “Other long-term liabilities” line in the table below include $911 million of noncurrent gross unrecognized tax benefits and related interest (and do not include $75 million of current gross unrecognized tax benefits which are included in the “Accrued expenses and other liabilities” line on the Consolidated Balance Sheet). However, the timing of the long-term portion of these tax liabilities is uncertain, and therefore, they have been included in the “More Than 5 Years” column in the table below. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits. Certain of the Company’s acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table below does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts of any such payments are uncertain. Refer to “—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” for a discussion of other contractual obligations that are not reflected in the table below.($ in millions)Total Less ThanOne Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than5 YearsDebt and leases: Debt obligations (a)(b)$9,724.8 $50.6 $4,346.5 $1,748.5 $3,579.2Capital lease obligations (b)15.5 1.2 2.8 11.5 —Total debt and leases9,740.3 51.8 4,349.3 1,760.0 3,579.2Interest payments on debt and capital lease obligations (c)1,105.6 128.9 210.0 158.4 608.3Operating lease obligations (d)1,009.9 203.0 301.0 218.7 287.2Other: Purchase obligations (e)659.1 610.2 45.7 3.0 0.2Other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet (f)5,075.8 — 621.5 515.2 3,939.1Total$17,590.7 $993.9 $5,527.5 $2,655.3 $8,414.0(a) As described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(b) Amounts do not include interest payments. Interest on debt and capital lease obligations is reflected in a separate line in the table.(c) Interest payments on debt are projected for future periods using the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2018. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates.(d) As described in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain leases require the Company to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises. These future costs are not included in the table above. As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company adopted ASC 842 related to lease accounting on January 1, 2019. Future minimum lease payments differ from the future lease liability recognized under ASC 842, as the lease liability recognized under ASC 842 discounts the lease payments while the minimum lease payments are not discounted. Additionally, ASC 842 allows a lessee to elect to combine or separate any non-lease components in an arrangement with the lease components for the calculation of the lease liability while the minimum lease payments exclude any non-lease components.(e) Consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction.(f) Primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies and allowances, performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs, self-insurance and litigation claims, postretirement benefits, pension obligations, deferred tax 53Table of Contentsliabilities and deferred compensation obligations. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management’s estimates over the terms of these arrangements and is largely based upon historical experience.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsGuarantees and Related InstrumentsThe following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of guarantees and related instruments of the Company as of December 31, 2018. Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period($ in millions)Total Less ThanOne Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than5 YearsGuarantees and related instruments$667.8 $572.1 $51.2 $21.9 $22.6Guarantees and related instruments consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit, bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds. These have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors, customers, insurance providers, financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure the Company’s obligations and/or performance requirements related to specific transactions.Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters or tax matters. In particular, in connection with the 2016 Fortive Separation and the 2015 split-off of the Company’s communications business, Danaher entered into separation and distribution and related agreements pursuant to which Danaher agreed to indemnify the other parties against certain damages and expenses that might occur in the future. These indemnification obligations cover a variety of liabilities, including, but not limited to, employee, tax and environmental matters. The Company has not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they relate to unknown conditions and the Company cannot estimate the potential liabilities from such matters, but the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. In addition, as a result of these divestitures, as well as restructuring activities, certain properties leased by the Company have been sublet to third-parties. In the event any of these third-parties vacate any of these premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by such sub-lessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In the normal course of business, the Company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers, suppliers or other business partners for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the Company’s products, software or services or claims alleging that Company products or services infringe third-party intellectual property. The Company has not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual obligations table above. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations.The Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the Company, or by reason of serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to limited exceptions. Danaher’s Amended and Restated By-laws provide for similar indemnification rights. In addition, Danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of Danaher Corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which Danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding. While the Company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage.Legal ProceedingsRefer to “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies, and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”54Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESManagement’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience, the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments.The Company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period-to-period. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Acquired Intangibles—The Company’s business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill, in-process R&D and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the Company may incur. Refer to Notes 1, 3 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s policies relating to goodwill, acquired intangibles and acquisitions.In performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market-based approach. In evaluating the estimates derived by the market-based approach, management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected. In certain circumstances the Company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (i.e., an income approach) in order to validate the results of the market approach. The discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had eight reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment. Management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units generally decreases as these businesses are integrated into the Company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2018 indicated that in all instances, the fair values of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 15% to approximately 600%. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this hypothetical 10% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 5% to approximately 530%.The Company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company also tests intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. These analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues, expenses, market conditions and discount rates related to these assets.If actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, the Company’s estimates of goodwill and intangible assets have been materially correct.Contingent Liabilities—As discussed in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). The Company recognizes a liability for any legal contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors, including those discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If 55Table of Contentsthe reserves established by the Company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s financial statements.Revenue Recognition—On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes nearly all previous revenue recognition guidance. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company’s adoption of this ASU. The Company derives revenues from the sale of products and services. Revenue is recognized when control over the promised products or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In determining if control has transferred, the Company considers whether certain indicators of the transfer of control are present, such as the transfer of title, present right to payment, significant risks and rewards of ownership and customer acceptance when acceptance is not a formality. To determine the consideration that the customer owes the Company, the Company must make judgments regarding the amount of customer allowances and rebates, as well as an estimate for product returns. The Company also enters into lease arrangements with customers, which requires the Company to determine whether the arrangements are operating or sales-type leases. Certain of the Company’s lease contracts are customized for larger customers and often result in complex terms and conditions that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criteria. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s revenue recognition policies.If the Company’s judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect, the Company’s reported revenues in particular periods may be incorrect. Historically, the Company’s estimates of revenue have been materially correct.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits—For a description of the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit accounting practices, refer to Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations, including assumptions regarding discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rates of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates and other factors. If the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change (as a result of differences in actual experience, changes in key economic indicators or other factors) the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements could be materially affected. A 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the U.S. net obligation by $121 million ($92 million on an after-tax basis) and the non-U.S. net obligation by $125 million ($96 million on an after-tax basis) from the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2018. A 50 basis point increase in the discount rates used for the plans would have decreased the U.S. net obligation by $111 million ($84 million on an after-tax basis) and the non-U.S. net obligation by $120 million ($93 million on an after-tax basis) from the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2018.For 2018, the estimated long-term rate of return for the U.S. plans is 7.0%, and the Company intends to continue to use an assumption of 7.0% for 2019. The estimated long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plans was determined on a plan-by-plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 1.0% to 5.8%. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2018 was reduced by 50 basis points, pension expense for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans for 2018 would have increased $10 million ($8 million on an after-tax basis) and $6 million ($5 million on an after-tax basis), respectively.For a discussion of the Company’s 2018 and anticipated 2019 defined benefit pension plan contributions, refer to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash and Cash Requirements”.Income Taxes—For a description of the Company’s income tax accounting policies, refer to Notes 1 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. This requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding: (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. Future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when, based upon the technical merits, it is “more likely than not” that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. Judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions. The Company re-evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances, including when: (1) a tax audit is completed; (2) applicable tax laws change, including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (3) the applicable statute of limitations expires.On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted, which substantially changed the U.S. tax system, including lowering the corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% (beginning in 2018). While the changes from the TCJA were generally effective 56Table of Contentsbeginning in 2018, GAAP accounting for income taxes requires the effect of a change in tax laws or rates to be recognized in income from continuing operations for the period that includes the enactment date. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the enactment of the TCJA, SAB No. 118 allowed the Company to record provisional amounts in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017. Where reasonable estimates could be made, the provisional accounting was based on such estimates. When no reasonable estimate could be made, SAB No. 118 required the accounting to be based on the tax law in effect before the TCJA. The Company was required to complete its tax accounting for the TCJA when it had obtained, prepared and analyzed the information to complete the income tax accounting but no later than December 22, 2018. The Company completed its accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the TCJA based on the Company’s interpretation of the new tax regulations and related guidance. The net tax effect to adjust the prior year provisional amounts was not material to the Company’s financial statements. Due to the complexity and recent issuance of these tax regulations, management’s interpretations of the impact of these rules could be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities. Some or all of these judgments are also subject to review by the IRS. If the IRS were to successfully challenge the Company’s right to realize some or all of the tax benefit the Company has recorded, or its interpretation of the law regarding certain items, or if the amount of the Transition Tax or other tax liabilities are understated, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements.In addition, certain of the Company’s tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in Denmark and the United States (refer to “—Results of Operations—Income Taxes” and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws. However, the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in the Company being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, including its effective tax rate.An increase of 1.0% in the Company’s 2018 nominal tax rate would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $33 million.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSFor a discussion of the new accounting standards impacting the Company, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.ITEM 7A.

RISK FACTORSYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, economic conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws, regulations or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns including epidemics, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and stock price.We may not complete the GE Biopharma Acquisition within the time frame we anticipate or at all; regulatory approval of the GE Biopharma Acquisition is subject to conditions; and the GE Biopharma Acquisition could negatively impact our business, financial statements and stock price.•If the GE Biopharma Acquisition is not completed on the anticipated timetable or at all, or if regulatory approval of the acquisition is subject to additional conditions, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the GE Biopharma Acquisition on the anticipated timetable or at all.•The GE Biopharma Business could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we pay or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable, or we could fail to operate such business profitably.•The GE Biopharma Acquisition could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations in any given period, or over the long-term.12•Pre-closing and post-closing earnings charges related to the GE Biopharma Acquisition could adversely impact operating results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period-to-period.•The GE Biopharma Acquisition could create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address.•The GE Biopharma Acquisition will divert management’s attention and other resources, which could have a negative impact on our ability to manage existing operations or pursue other strategic transactions.•We could experience difficulty or greater-than-anticipated costs in integrating the personnel, operations and financial and other controls and systems of GE Biopharma, and could experience difficulty attracting and retaining key employees and customers.•We may be unable to achieve anticipated cost savings or other synergies on the timetable we expect or at all.•We may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from GE Biopharma’s activities and the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations.•The GE Biopharma Purchase Agreement includes provisions relating to purchase price adjustments, which may have unpredictable financial results.•As a result of the GE Biopharma Acquisition, we expect to record significant goodwill and other assets on our balance sheet and if we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur impairment charges.The GE Biopharma Acquisition discussed above would constitute Danaher’s largest acquisition to date based on purchase price, would expand Danaher’s business into new fields and involves a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges. Any of these risks or challenges could adversely affect our business, financial statements and stock price.Our outstanding debt has increased significantly in anticipation of the GE Biopharma Acquisition, and we expect to incur additional debt in the future. Our existing and future indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and negatively impact our credit ratings; and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements.As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $21.7 billion in outstanding indebtedness, including approximately $10.8 billion of long-term debt we issued in 2019 to fund a portion of the purchase price of the GE Biopharma Acquisition. In addition, we had the ability to incur approximately $4.9 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facility based on the amounts available under the Company’s 2020 Credit Facilities which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances. We expect to incur approximately $2.0 billion of additional indebtedness (additional to indebtedness incurred as of December 31, 2019) to fund a portion of the purchase price of the GE Biopharma Acquisition.Our debt level and related debt service obligations can have negative consequences, including (1) requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and other investments; (2) reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and (3) exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates.We anticipate that the indebtedness we have incurred and expect to incur in connection with the GE Biopharma Acquisition will result in a negative change to our credit ratings compared to our credit rating prior to the public announcement of the GE Biopharma Acquisition. The recent bonds issued by DH Europe Finance II S.a.r.l. (“Danaher International II”) and guaranteed by Danaher Corporation were rated BBB+ by Standard & Poors and Baa1 by Moody’s, each two notches below Danaher’s current long-term unsecured debt credit rating. Upon closing the GE Biopharma Acquisition we expect Danaher’s long-term unsecured debt credit rating to be downgraded to mirror that of the bonds issued by Danaher International II. This anticipated reduction in our credit ratings may limit our ability to borrow at interest rates consistent with the interest rates that have been available to us prior to the GE Biopharma Acquisition. If our credit ratings are further downgraded or put on watch for a further potential downgrade, we may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in the amounts, at the times or interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if our current credit ratings were maintained.13Our 2020 Credit Facilities and long-term debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us, including certain restrictions on our ability to incur liens on our assets, and a requirement under the 2020 Credit Facilities to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus shareholders’ equity) of 0.65 to 1.0 or less. If we breach any of these restrictions and cannot obtain a waiver from the lenders on favorable terms, subject to applicable cure periods, the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements.If we incur additional debt in the future, the risks described above would increase.Conditions in the global economy, the particular markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our business is sensitive to general economic conditions. Slower global economic growth, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt, volatility in the currency and credit markets, high levels of unemployment or underemployment, reduced levels of capital expenditures, changes or anticipation of potential changes in government trade, fiscal, tax and monetary policies, changes in capital requirements for financial institutions, government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics, sequestration, austerity measures and other challenges that affect the global economy have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, the Company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, including having the effect of:•reducing demand for our products and services (in this Annual Report, references to products and services also includes software), limiting the financing available to our customers and suppliers, increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies;•increasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories;•increasing price competition in our served markets; •supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; •increasing the risk of impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, and the risk that we may not be able to fully recover the value of other assets such as real estate and tax assets; •increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which, in addition to increasing the risks identified above, could result in preference actions against us; and•adversely impacting market sizes and growth rates.Although we have been able to access the commercial paper and other capital markets through the date of this report, there can be no assurances that such markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facility will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations.If growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period, if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve, our business and financial statements could be adversely affected.Significant developments or uncertainties stemming from the U.S. administration, including changes in U.S. trade policies, tariffs and the reaction of other countries thereto, particularly China, can have an adverse effect on our business.Changes, potential changes or uncertainties in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate, or governing the health care system and drug prices, can adversely affect our business and financial statements. For example, the U.S. administration has increased tariffs on certain goods imported into the United States, raised the possibility of imposing significant, additional tariff increases and called for substantial changes to trade agreements. In particular, trade tensions between the United States and China have escalated and each country has imposed significant, additional tariffs on a wide range of goods imported from the other country. China accounted for approximately 13% of our sales in 2019. These factors have adversely affected, and in the future could further adversely affect, our business and financial statements.14Our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve, and visibility into our markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies, and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities. Demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, marketing or promotional programs, new product introductions, the timing of industry trade shows and changes in distributor or customer inventory levels due to distributor or customer management thereof or other factors. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period. We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share. Even if we compete effectively, we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services.Our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. Because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors; refer to “Item 1. Business—Competition” for additional details. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets, including high-growth markets. In addition, significant shifts in industry market share have occurred and may in the future occur in connection with product problems, safety alerts and publications about products, reflecting the competitive significance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems in our industry. Our failure to compete effectively and/or pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements, and our expansion into new markets may result in greater-than-expected risks, liabilities and expenses. In addition, the Company’s competitors and customers have from time to time introduced, and may in the future introduce, private label, generic or low-cost products that compete with the Company’s products at lower price points. Competitors’ products can capture significant market share or lead to a decrease in market prices overall, resulting in an adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements.Our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation.We generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis, our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer. Our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to:•correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;•allocate our R&D funding to products and services with higher growth prospects;•anticipate and respond to our competitors’ development of new products and services and technological innovations;•differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings and avoid commoditization;•innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets;•obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies before our competitors do;•successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time;•obtain necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope (including with respect to medical device products by demonstrating satisfactory clinical results where applicable, as well as achieving third-party reimbursement); and•stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies.15If we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in R&D of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. Even when we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we often incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. In addition, promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, uncertainty over third-party reimbursement or entrenched patterns of clinical practice. Competitors may also develop after-market services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products.Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements can be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems, including our Code of Conduct, always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, economic and trade sanctions, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier code of conduct, and material violations of such code of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.Certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. FDA and by comparable agencies of other countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the health care industry and the privacy and security of health information. Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements.Certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the U.S. FDA, by other federal and state governmental agencies, by comparable agencies of other countries and regions, by certain accrediting bodies and by regulations governing hazardous materials and drugs-of abuse (or the manufacture and sale of products containing any such materials). The global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent and unpredictable. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years, and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, their existing regulations. Please see “Regulatory Matters—Medical Device Regulations” for more information. Failure to meet these requirements adversely impacts our business in the applicable geographies.To varying degrees, these regulators require us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution and post-marketing surveillance of our products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance (such as 510(k) clearance) or approvals for our new products or modifications to (or additional indications or uses of) existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be time-consuming, costly and subject to restrictions. Our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors, for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results, and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained. Even after initial regulatory clearance or approval, we are subject to periodic inspection by these regulatory authorities, and if safety issues arise we can be required to amend conditions for use of a product, such as providing additional warnings on the product’s label or narrowing its approved intended use, which could reduce the product’s market acceptance. Failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products (or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products), other violations of these regulations, failure to remediate inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products (even after obtaining clearance for distribution) and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to FDA Form 483 Inspectional Observations, warning letters, notices to customers, declining sales, loss of customers, loss of market share, remediation and increased compliance costs, recalls, seizures of adulterated or misbranded products, injunctions, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, narrowing of permitted uses for a product, suspension or withdrawal of approvals and pre-market notification rescissions. We are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse, research and development, pricing and sales and 16marketing practices, the privacy and security of health information as well as manufacturing and quality standards, including the federal regulations described in “Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters.” Ensuring that our internal operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations involves substantial costs. It is also possible that government authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law.Noncompliance with the laws and regulations referenced above can result in, among other things, fines, expenses, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant 510(k) clearance of devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals, criminal prosecutions and other adverse effects referenced below under “Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and our business, including our reputation.” Further, defending against any such actions can be costly and time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions brought against us, our business may be impaired.Our products are subject to clinical trials, the results of which may be unexpected, or perceived as unfavorable by the market, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.As a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for certain new products and new indications for certain existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unexpected or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials, or a regulator’s or the market’s perception of this clinical data, can adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate and our business and financial statements.Off-label marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties.The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about approved or cleared products. In particular, any clearances we may receive only permit us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the FDA. We may request additional label indications for our current products, and the FDA may deny those requests outright, require additional expensive performance or clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance. If the FDA determines that we have marketed our products for off-label use, we can be subject to fines, injunctions or other penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, substantial monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, and/or the curtailment of our operations. Any of these events could significantly harm our business and financial statements.Certain modifications to our products may require new 510(k) clearances or other marketing authorizations and may require us to recall or cease marketing our products.Once a medical device is permitted to be legally marketed in the United States pursuant to a 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer may be required to notify the FDA of certain modifications to the device. Manufacturers determine in the first instance whether a change to a product requires a new 510(k) clearance or premarket submission, but the FDA may review any manufacturer’s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances are necessary. We have made modifications to our products in the past and have determined based on our review of the applicable FDA regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 510(k) clearances or other premarket submissions were not required. We may make similar modifications or add additional features in the future that we believe do not require a new 510(k) clearance. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations and requires us to submit new 510(k) notifications, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.The health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, which could adversely affect our financial statements.The health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, including the following:•many of our customers, and the end-users to whom our customers supply products, rely on government funding of and reimbursement for health care products and services and research activities. The PPACA, health care austerity measures in other countries and other potential health care reform changes and government austerity measures have reduced and may further reduce the amount of government funding or reimbursement available to customers or end-users of our products and services and/or the volume of medical procedures using our products and services. For 17example, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, introduced a multi-year pricing program for services payable under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (“CLFS”) that is designed to bring Medicare allowable amounts in line with the amounts paid by private payers. It is still unclear whether and to what extent these new rates will affect overall pricing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing services, but to the extent our customers conclude that Medicare reimbursement for these services is inadequate, it can in turn adversely impact the prices at which we sell our products. Other countries, as well as some private payors, also control the price of health care products, directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing or coverage limitations, tying reimbursement to outcomes or (in the case of governmental entities) through compulsory licensing. Global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement.•governmental and private health care providers and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the delivery of health care services, centralizing purchasing, limiting the number of vendors that may participate in purchasing programs, forming group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks and pursuing consolidation to improve their purchasing leverage and using competitive bid processes to procure health care products and services.These changes as well as other impacts from market demand, government regulations, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures are changing the way healthcare is delivered, reimbursed and funded and have in the past and could in the future cause participants in the health care industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services, reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products and services from governmental agencies or third-party payors, heighten clinical data requirements, reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services, affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products and increase our compliance and other costs. In addition, we may be excluded from important market segments or unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us, and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability. All of the factors described above can adversely affect our business and financial statements.Any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices, and to make appropriate investments that support our long-term strategy, could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price.Our ability to grow revenues, earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies, and to make appropriate investments that support our long-term strategy. We may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price. Promising acquisitions and investments are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including high valuations, competition among prospective buyers, the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain applicable antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms. In addition, competition for acquisitions and investments has resulted and may result in higher purchase prices. Changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions and investments.Our acquisition of businesses, investments, joint ventures and other strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements.As part of our business strategy we acquire businesses, make investments and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course, and we also from time to time complete more significant transactions; refer to MD&A for additional details. Acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our business and our financial statements:•businesses, technologies, services and products that we acquire or invest in sometimes under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid or fail to perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable, resulting in a failure to operate any such business profitably.•we from time to time incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships, which can also cause a deterioration of Danaher’s credit ratings, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense and diminish our future access to the capital markets.•acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships can cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations in any given period, or over the long-term.18•pre-closing and post-closing earnings charges can adversely impact operating results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period-to-period.•acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships can create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address.•we can experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other controls and systems and retaining key employees and customers.•we may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition, investment, joint venture or strategic relationship.•we have assumed and may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company’s or investee’s activities and the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies can increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations.•in connection with acquisitions and joint ventures, we often enter into post-closing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments, earn-out obligations and indemnification obligations, which can have unpredictable financial results.•as a result of our acquisitions and investments, we have recorded significant goodwill and other assets on our balance sheet and if we are not able to realize the value of these assets, or if the fair value of our investments declines, we are required to incur impairment charges.•we may have interests that diverge from those of our joint venture partners or other strategic partners and we may not be able to direct the management and operations of the joint venture or other strategic relationship in the manner we believe is most appropriate, exposing us to additional risk.•investing in or making loans to early-stage companies often entails a high degree of risk, and we do not always achieve the strategic, technological, financial or commercial benefits we anticipate; we may lose our investment or fail to recoup our loan; or our investment may be illiquid for a greater-than-expected period of time.The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the acquired company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements.Divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we or our predecessors have sold could adversely affect our financial statements.We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest, spin-off, split-off or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. For example, in 2015, Danaher separated and split-off to Danaher shareholders the majority of its former communications business in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction with NetScout Systems, Inc. (the “Communications Disposition”), in 2016 Danaher separated and spun-off to Danaher shareholders its former Test & Measurement segment, Industrial Technologies segment (excluding the product identification businesses) and retail/commercial petroleum business (collectively known as Fortive Corporation) (the “Fortive Disposition”), and in 2019 Danaher consummated the separation and initial public offering (“IPO”) and subsequent split-off of its Dental segment, known as Envista Holdings Corporation (the “Envista Disposition”). Transactions such as these pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements. For example, when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not become satisfied. In addition, divestitures or other dispositions can dilute the Company’s earnings per share, have other adverse financial, tax and accounting impacts and distract management, and disputes can arise with buyers. In addition, we have retained responsibility for and/or have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we or our predecessors have sold or 19disposed. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.We could incur significant liability if any of the 2015 separation and split-off of our communications business, the 2016 separation and spin-off of Fortive or the 2019 separation, IPO and split-off of Envista is determined to be a taxable transaction.We have received opinions from outside tax counsel to the effect that each of the Communications Disposition, the Fortive Disposition and the Envista Disposition qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code. These opinions rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, our stockholders and we may not be able to rely on the respective opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) could determine on audit that any such transactions are taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the respective opinion. If any such transaction is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.Potential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the 2015 separation and split-off of our communications business, the 2016 separation and spin-off of Fortive or the 2019 separation, IPO and split-off of Envista could materially and adversely affect our business and financial statements.With respect to each of the Communications Disposition, the Fortive Disposition and the Envista Disposition, we entered into a separation agreement and related agreements to govern the separation and related transactions and the relationship between the respective companies going forward. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party that can lead to disputes between us and the respective counterparty. If we are required to indemnify any of the other parties under the circumstances set forth in these agreements, we may be subject to substantial liabilities. In addition, with respect to the liabilities for which the other parties have agreed to indemnify us under these agreements, there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against such other parties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of the liabilities, or that such other parties will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. It is also possible that a court could disregard the allocation of assets and liabilities agreed to between Danaher and such other parties and require Danaher to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to such other parties. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business and financial statements.A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or data or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.We rely on information technology systems, some of which are provided and/or managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers, other business partners and patients), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as receiving and fulfilling orders, billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations). In addition, some of our remote monitoring products and services incorporate software and information technology that house personal data and some products or software we sell to customers connect to our systems for maintenance or other purposes. These systems, products and services (including those we acquire through business acquisitions) may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, human error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Attacks may also target hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. Security breaches of systems provided or enabled by us, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services, or security breaches of third party systems we rely on to process, store or transmit electronic information, could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers, patients or suppliers. Like most multinational corporations, our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. Unauthorized tampering, adulteration or interference with our products may also adversely affect product functionality and result in loss of data, risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions. Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer, patient, business partner and employee relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, 20legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, in each case resulting in an adverse effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.If we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches, we may suffer adverse regulatory consequences, business consequences and litigation. As a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. Please see “Regulatory Matters - Data Privacy and Security Laws” for additional information. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured patient health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by the HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EU member states may result in fines of up to €20 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties. Several other countries such as China and Russia have passed, and other countries are considering passing, laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. There is also a new, broad privacy law in California, the CCPA, which came into effect in January 2020. The CCPA has some of the same features as the GDPR, and has already prompted several other states to follow with similar laws. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. In addition, compliance with the varying data privacy regulations across the United States and around the world has required significant expenditures and may require additional expenditures, and may require further changes in our products or business models that increase competition or reduce revenue.Our operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.Our operations, products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment, establish standards for the use, generation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and impose end-of-life disposal and take-back programs. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the United States and abroad in connection with our operations. We cannot assure you that our environmental, health and safety compliance program (or the compliance programs of businesses we acquire) have been or will at all times be effective. Failure to comply with any of these laws can result in civil and criminal, monetary and nonmonetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements.In addition, we from time to time incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury, property damage or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury or damage due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. We can also become subject to additional remedial, compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules. For additional information regarding these risks, refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. We cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. However, based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2019 will have a material effect on our financial statements.Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and our business, including our reputation.In addition to the environmental, health, safety, health care, medical device, anticorruption, data privacy and other regulations noted elsewhere in this Annual Report, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional levels, including the following:•we are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons and dealings between our 21employees and between our subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory. In addition, from time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions. These business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income, but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures have prevented and will prevent violations of these regulations and any violation can adversely affect our reputation, business and financial statements.•we also have agreements to sell products and services to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with government entities (less than 5% of our 2019 sales were made to the U.S. federal government). The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. Our agreements with government entities are in some cases subject to termination, reduction or modification at the convenience of the government or in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors, and we may underestimate our costs of performing under the contract. In certain cases, a governmental entity may require us to pay back amounts it has paid to us. Government contracts that have been awarded to us following a bid process can become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder, which could result in loss of the contract. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts. These are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. The regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and can be inconsistent across jurisdictions. We, our representatives and the industries in which we operate are at times under review and/or investigation by regulatory authorities. Failure to comply (or any alleged or perceived failure to comply) with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations can result in import detentions, fines, damages, civil and administrative penalties, injunctions, suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts, disbarment from selling to certain governmental agencies or exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disruption of our business, limitation on our ability to manufacture, import, export and sell products and services, loss of customers, significant legal and investigatory fees, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, reputational harm, contractual damages, diminished profits, curtailment or restricting of business operations, criminal prosecution and other monetary and non-monetary penalties. Compliance with these and other regulations can also affect our returns on investment, require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our business. Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the International Standards Organization, and failure to comply with these rules can result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our business and financial statements. For additional information regarding these risks, refer to “Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters.”Our restructuring actions can have long-term adverse effects on our business.In recent years, we have implemented significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. These restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities (including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses) reduce our available talent, assets and other resources and can slow improvements in our products and services, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers, limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases and trigger adverse public attention. In addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize from such actions. Moreover, we may not succeed in implementing present or future restructuring activities or cost reduction activities. Realizing the anticipated benefits from these initiatives, if any benefits are achieved at all, can take several years, and we may be unable to achieve our targeted cost efficiencies and profit margin improvements. Additionally, we may have insufficient access to capital to fund investments in these strategic initiatives, or our business strategy may change from time to time, which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business. Any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements.22We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.As of December 31, 2019, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $32.5 billion. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets, changes in the structure of our business, divestitures, market capitalization declines, or increases in associated discount rates can impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized.Foreign currency exchange rates can adversely affect our financial statements.Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which can from time to time require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar adversely affects the cost of materials, products and services we purchase overseas. Sales and expenses of our non-U.S. businesses are also translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar generally results in unfavorable translation effects. In addition, certain of our businesses invoice customers in a currency other than the business’ functional currency, and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency can also result in unfavorable translation effects. The Company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries.Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments can affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities can result in additional tax payments for prior periods.We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was enacted. The TCJA significantly revised the U.S. federal corporate income tax law by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate to 21.0%, implementing a quasi-territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time tax on unremitted cumulative non-U.S. earnings of foreign subsidiaries (“Transition Tax”). Due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the TCJA), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our intercompany arrangements, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, our estimates of effective tax rate and income tax assets and liabilities can be incorrect and our financial statements could be adversely affected; please refer to MD&A for a discussion of additional factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period. The impact of these factors referenced in the first sentence of this paragraph may be substantially different from period-to-period. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities, such as the audits described in MD&A and the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. If audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our results can include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements can be adversely affected. In particular, the IRS’ proposed adjustments to certain of the Company’s historical taxable income with respect to the deferral of tax on certain premium income related to the Company’s self-insurance programs, and the Danish tax authority’s assessments purporting to impose withholding tax relating to interest accrued in Denmark on historical borrowings from certain of the Company’s subsidiaries (each as further discussed in MD&A and the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements), each could take many years to resolve and could ultimately result in a material, adverse impact to the Company’s financial statements, including its cash flows and effective tax rates. Any further significant changes to the tax system in the United States or in other jurisdictions (including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below) could also adversely affect our financial statements.Changes in tax law relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect our tax position.The U.S. Congress, government agencies in non-U.S. jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting,” where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in low-tax jurisdictions, or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. The OECD has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules to address base erosion and profit shifting. As a result, the tax laws in the United States and other countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect our business and financial statements.23We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that can adversely affect our business and financial statements.We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims or counterclaims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, breach of contract claims, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiture-related matters, as well as regulatory subpoenas, requests for information, investigations and enforcement. We also from time to time become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, businesses divested by us or our predecessors. The types of claims made in lawsuits include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages (and in some cases, treble damages) and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits can divert our management’s attention, we from time to time incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we can be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that adversely affect our operations and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. In addition, developments in proceedings in any given period can require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments can adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. We cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with current and future litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and business. However, based on our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2019 will have a material effect on our financial statements.From time to time, we become aware through our internal audits and other internal control procedures, employees or other parties of possible compliance matters, such as complaints or concerns relating to accounting, internal controls, financial reporting, auditing or ethical matters or relating to compliance with laws. When we become aware of such possible compliance matters, we investigate internally and take appropriate corrective action. Internal investigations can lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of legal or regulatory proceedings against us and adversely affect our financial statements.If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third-parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights. These risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of intellectual property comparable to the United States.Many of the markets we serve are technology-driven, and as a result intellectual property rights play a significant role in product development and differentiation. We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our business. The intellectual property rights that we obtain, however, are not always sufficiently broad and do not always provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. In addition, the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property do not always prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented, designed-around or becoming subject to compulsory licensing. In some circumstances, enforcement is not available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third-parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights can adversely impact our business, including our competitive position, and financial statements.These risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of corporate proprietary information, intellectual property, technology and other assets comparable to the United States. The risks we encounter in such countries include the following:•Joint ventures that we participate in can include restrictions that could compromise our control over the intellectual property, technology and proprietary information of the joint venture;24•As we expand our operations globally, increasing amounts of our data, intellectual property and technology is used and stored in countries outside the United States, and regulations in certain countries require data to be stored locally. These factors increase the risk that such data, intellectual property and technology could be stolen or otherwise compromised;•Certain of our products have been counterfeited and we may encounter additional and/or increased levels of counterfeiting in the future;•Governmental entities may adopt regulations or other requirements that give them rights to certain of our intellectual property, technology and/or proprietary information, such as through compulsory licensing or foreign ownership restrictions or requirements;•In certain countries, we do not have the same ability to enforce intellectual property rights as we do in the United States; •Governmental regulations relating to state secrecy or other topics limit our ability to transfer data or technology out of certain jurisdictions; •Risks, costs and challenges of operating in a particular jurisdiction can result in a decision to relocate or divert operations to a different jurisdiction, potentially at higher cost.Any of these risks can adversely impact our business, including our competitive position, and financial statements. Refer to “—International economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements” for a discussion of additional risks relating to our international operations.Third-parties from time to time claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.From time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation of third parties’ intellectual property and cannot be certain that the conduct of our business does not and will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of others. Disputes or litigations regarding intellectual property can be costly and time-consuming to defend due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to critical technology, be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services, be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights, be required to license technology or other intellectual property rights from others, be required to cease marketing, manufacturing or using certain products or be required to redesign, re-engineer or re-brand our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our business, including our competitive position, and financial statements. Third-party intellectual property rights may also make it more difficult or expensive for us to meet market demand for particular product or design innovations. When we are required to seek licenses under patents or other intellectual property rights of others, we are not always able to acquire these licenses on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.The U.S. government has certain rights to use and disclose some of the intellectual property that we license and could exclusively license it to a third-party if we fail to achieve practical application of the intellectual property.Certain technology licensed by us under agreements with third-party licensors is subject to government rights. Government rights in inventions conceived or reduced to practice under a government-funded program can include a nonexclusive, royalty-free worldwide license to practice or have practiced such inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the U.S. government has the right to require us or our licensors (as applicable) to grant licenses which would be exclusive under any of such inventions to a third-party if they determine that: (1) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize such inventions in a particular field of use; (2) such action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (3) such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations. Further, the government rights include the right to use and disclose, without limitation, technical data relating to licensed technology that was developed in whole or in part at government expense.Defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products or services, or allegations thereof, can adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.Manufacturing or design defects or “bugs” in, unanticipated use of, safety or quality issues (or the perception of such issues) with respect to, “off label” use of, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or 25sell (including items that we source from third-parties) can lead to personal injury, death, property damage, loss of profits or other liability. These events can lead to recalls or safety alerts, result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us. Recalls, removals and product liability and similar claims (regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome) result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. Our business can also be affected by studies of the utilization, safety and efficacy of medical device products and components that are conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. Any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of product issues, including claims by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class.The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products, our reputation, business and financial statements could suffer.The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems can arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters and environmental factors, and if not discovered before the product is released to market can result in recalls and product liability exposure. Because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities and other stringent regulations of the FDA and similar agencies regarding the manufacture of certain of our products, an alternative manufacturer is not always available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity. Any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant costs, liability and lost revenue, loss of market share as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products.Adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition, performance, purchasing patterns or inventory levels of, key distributors and other channel partners can adversely affect our financial statements.Certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to or through key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and end-users. Some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products or compete with us directly, and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. Adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners, reduction or discontinuation of their purchases from us or adverse developments in their financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns, can adversely affect our business and financial statements. The levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners, and changes in those levels, also impacts our results of operations in any given period. In addition, the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries can adversely impact our business and financial statements.Certain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other third-parties for development, supply and marketing of certain products and potential products, and such collaborative partners or other third-parties could fail to perform sufficiently.We believe that for certain of our businesses, success in penetrating target markets depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies. Relying on collaborative relationships is risky because, among other things, our collaborative partners may (1) not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations; (2) fail to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner; (3) be acquired by other companies and terminate our collaborative partnership or become insolvent; (4) compete with us; (5) disagree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship; (6) have insufficient capital resources; and (7) decline to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms. Because these and other factors may be beyond our control, the development or commercialization of our products involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. If we or any of our collaborative partners terminate a collaborative arrangement, we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or we may need to cancel some development programs, which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations.As discussed in “Item 1. Business—Materials,” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components, raw materials and other commodities, including metallic-based components, electronic components, chemicals, plastics and other petroleum-based products. Prices for and availability of these components, raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past. Any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business. In addition, due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve, the cost-containment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to, when commodity prices rise we are not always able to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset 26these increases through cost reductions, or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs, our margins and profitability could decline and our financial statements could be adversely affected.If we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand, our profitability may suffer. In addition, our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials, components and services can cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies.We purchase materials, components and equipment from third-parties for use in our manufacturing operations, including metallic-based components, electronic components, chemicals, plastics and other petroleum-based products. Our profitability could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations, including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality. During a market upturn, suppliers from time to time extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices. If we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand, we may not be able to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed, our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities. Conversely, in order to secure supplies for the production of products, we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors, which can impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer.In addition, some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, regulatory requirements, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. If these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. The supply chains for our businesses can also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, war, terrorist actions, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes. Any of these factors can result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies.Because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, at times our manufacturing capacity exceeds or falls short of our production requirements. Any or all of these problems can result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our financial statements.Changes in governmental regulations can reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses.We compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional regulations, such as regulations governing health and safety, the environment, food and drugs, privacy and electronic communications. We develop, configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. Any significant change in any of these regulations (or in the interpretation or application thereof) can reduce demand for, increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services, or restrict our existing activities, products and services. For example, a number of our products and services are marketed to the pharmaceutical and related industries for use in discovering and developing drugs and therapies. Changes in the U.S. FDA’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process can have an adverse effect on the demand for these products and services. In addition, in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations. In these markets, the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations, the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address or the repeal of existing regulations, can adversely affect demand. In addition, regulatory deadlines can result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period-to-period.Work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations.Certain of our U.S. and non-U.S. employees are subject to collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our financial statements and business, including our productivity and reputation.27International economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements.In 2019, approximately 63% of our sales were derived from customers outside the United States. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located outside the United States. Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the United States and increase the localization of our products and services, we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the United States, particularly in the high-growth markets. Our international business (and particularly our business in high-growth markets) is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations, including:•interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers; •differences in terms of sale, including payment terms;•local product preferences and product requirements;•changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, such as the devaluation of particular currencies;•trade protection measures, embargoes and import or export restrictions and requirements;•unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws;•capital controls and limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash;•the potential for nationalization of enterprises;•changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs;•limitations on legal rights and our ability to enforce such rights;•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;•differing labor regulations;•difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis; •differing protection of intellectual property; and•greater uncertainty, risk, expense and delay in commercializing products in certain foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to product and other regulatory approvals.International business risks have in the past and may in the future negatively affect our financial statements, business, growth rate, competitive position, and financial condition.For example, in 2019 we generated approximately 13% of our sales from China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operations can be adversely influenced by political, economic and social conditions in China generally. Additionally, China’s government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies, and it maintains control over China’s economic growth through setting monetary policy and determining treatment of particular industries or companies. Further, considerable uncertainty exists regarding the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world’s leading economies, including the United States and China. Uncertainty or adverse changes to economic conditions in China or the policies of China’s government or its laws and regulations can have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China and can impact our business and operating results, reducing demand for our products and adversely affecting our financial statements, business, growth rate and competitive position and financial condition. In addition, our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and epidemics, such as the novel strain of coronavirus that recently originated in China (COVID-19), which could adversely impact our operations, supply chains and distribution systems and reduce demand for our products and services. While we believe the coronavirus may have a negative impact on our financial results, the impact is difficult to assess at this time.Significant developments stemming from the UK’s referendum decision to exit the EU could have an adverse effect on us.In a referendum on June 23, 2016, voters in the UK voted for the UK to exit the EU. The UK formally withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020 with a transition period through December 31, 2020. During the transition period, the UK will continue to follow EU law and will negotiate with the EU on the terms of its relationship. As it stands, the terms and the nature of the 28UK’s future relationship with the EU post-2020 are still being decided. This referendum and withdrawal has caused and may continue to cause political and economic uncertainty, including significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations. If no agreement is reached by December 31, 2020, the UK’s membership in the EU could terminate under a so-called “hard Brexit”. The effects of Brexit will depend on many factors, including any agreements that the UK makes to retain access to EU markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. In a “hard Brexit” scenario, there could be increased costs from re-imposition of tariffs on trade between the UK and EU, shipping delays because of the need for customs inspections and procedures, and temporary shortages of certain goods. In addition, trade and investment between the UK, the EU, the United States and other countries will be impacted by the fact that the UK currently operates under the EU’s tax treaties. The UK will need to negotiate its own tax and trade treaties with countries all over the world, which could take years to complete. We have manufacturing facilities in the UK, and, depending on the terms of Brexit, we could become subject to export tariffs and regulatory restrictions that could increase the costs and time related to doing business in Europe. Additionally, Brexit could result in the UK or the EU significantly altering its regulations affecting the clearance or approval of our products that are developed or manufactured in the UK. Any new regulations could add time and expense to the conduct of our business, as well as the process by which our products receive regulatory approval in the UK, the EU and elsewhere. Any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial statements. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had seven manufacturing facilities in the UK and the Company’s net investment in plant, property and equipment in the UK was $163 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, less than 5% of our sales were derived from customers located in the UK, however, the impact of Brexit could also impact our sales and operations outside the UK.If we suffer loss to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed.Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, public health crisis (including epidemics), war, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters, such as the damage caused to our facilities by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in September 2017. If any of these facilities, supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses. The third-party insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against such losses.Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements.The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets, investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates can increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements. In addition, upward pressure on the cost of providing health care coverage to current employees and retirees can increase our future funding obligations and adversely affect our financial statements.ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNot applicable.ITEM 2. PROPERTIESAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had facilities in over 60 countries, including approximately 212 significant administrative, sales, research and development, manufacturing and distribution facilities. 93 of these facilities are located in the United States in over 20 states and 119 are located outside the United States in over 30 other countries, primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia, South America, the rest of North America and Australia. These facilities cover approximately 18 million square feet, of which approximately 8 million square feet are owned and approximately 10 million square feet are leased. Particularly outside the United States, facilities often serve more than one business segment and may be used for multiple purposes. In addition to three significant corporate locations, the number of significant facilities by business segment is:•Life Sciences, 72;•Diagnostics, 80; and•Environmental & Applied Solutions, 57.29The Company considers its facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used and does not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. The Company believes its properties and equipment have been well-maintained. Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information with respect to the Company’s lease commitments.ITEM 3.

MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIESOur common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol DHR. As of February 6, 2020, there were approximately 2,431 holders of record of Danaher’s common stock. Any future payments of dividends on the Company’s common stock will be determined by Danaher’s Board of Directors and will depend on business conditions, Danaher’s earnings and other factors Danaher’s Board deems relevant.Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesThe Company’s repurchases of its equity securities during the fourth quarter of 2019 are listed below in the following table:PeriodTotal Number of Shares Purchased (1) Average Share Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs (1)(2) Maximum Number of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (2)September 28, 2019 - October 27, 2019— — — 20,000,000October 28, 2019 - November 26, 2019— — — 20,000,000November 27, 2019 - December 31, 201922,921,984 (1 ) 22,921,984 20,000,000Total22,921,984 (1 ) 22,921,984 20,000,000(1) On December 18, 2019, Danaher completed the disposition of the remaining 80.6% ownership of Envista Holdings Corporation common stock through a split-off exchange offer, which resulted in Danaher’s repurchase of 22.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for the remaining shares of Envista held by Danaher. Danaher common shareholders who participated in the exchange offer received in aggregate approximately 127.9 million shares of Envista common stock in exchange for all of the Danaher common shares exchanged. (2) On July 16, 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”) authorizing the repurchase of up to 20 million shares of the Company’s common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. There is no expiration date for the Repurchase Program, and the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will be determined by the Company’s management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Company’s equity compensation plans (or any successor plan) and for other corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2019, 20 million shares remained available for repurchase pursuant to the Repurchase Program. The Company expects to fund any future stock repurchases using the Company’s available cash balances or proceeds from the issuance of debt.Except in connection with the Envista Split-Off in 2019, neither the Company nor any “affiliated purchaser” repurchased any shares of Company common stock during 2019, 2018 or 2017.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide a reader of Danaher’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of Company management. The Company’s MD&A is divided into five sections:•Overview•Results of Operations•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Critical Accounting Estimates•New Accounting StandardsThis discussion and analysis should be read along with Danaher’s audited financial statements and related Notes thereto as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 included in this Annual Report. Unless otherwise indicated, all financial results in this report refer to continuing operations.OVERVIEWGeneralRefer to “Item 1. Business—General” for a discussion of Danaher’s strategic objectives and methodologies for delivering long-term shareholder value. Danaher is a multinational business with global operations. During 2019, approximately 63% of Danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the United States. As a diversified, global business, Danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors. Danaher’s geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of its products, software and services, help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. The Company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.As a result of the Company’s geographic and industry diversity, the Company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges, including rapid technological development (particularly with respect to computing, automation, artificial intelligence, mobile connectivity, communications and digitization) in most of the Company’s served markets, the expansion and evolution of opportunities in high-growth markets, trends and costs associated with a global labor force, consolidation of the Company’s competitors and increasing regulation. The Company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and the Company’s long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in high-growth geographies and high-growth market segments, identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative and differentiated new products and services with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of the Company’s sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated global environment. The Company is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources (particularly in high-growth markets) in order to be responsive to the Company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the Company’s operations.Business PerformanceConsolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased 5.0% as compared to 2018. While differences exist among the Company’s businesses, on an overall basis, demand for the Company’s products and services increased on a year-over-year basis in 2019 as compared to 2018. This demand, together with the Company’s continued investments in sales growth initiatives and the other business-specific factors discussed below, contributed to year-over-year core sales growth of 6.0% (for the definition of “core sales,” refer to “—Results of Operations” below). Geographically, both high-growth and developed markets contributed to year-over-year core sales growth during 2019. Core sales in high-growth markets grew at a high-single digit rate in 2019 as compared to 2018 led by strength in China. High-growth markets represented approximately 32% of the Company’s total sales in 2019. Core sales in developed markets grew at a mid-single digit rate in 2019 as compared to 2018 and were driven by North America and Western Europe. The Company’s net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled approximately $2.4 billion, or $3.26 per diluted share, compared to approximately $2.4 billion, or $3.39 per diluted share for the year ended 34Table of ContentsDecember 31, 2018. Net earnings attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled approximately $2.9 billion or $4.05 per diluted share compared to approximately $2.7 billion or $3.74 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2018. The gain on the disposition of Envista, partially offset by the tax-related charges discussed below in “—Results of Operations—Income Taxes” are the primary reasons for the year-over-year increase in net earnings attributable to common stockholders and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2019; refer to “—Results of Operations” for further discussion of year-over-year changes in net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2019. Refer to “Results of Operations—Discontinued Operations” for further discussion of the disposition of Envista.Acquisitions and DispositionsOn February 25, 2019, the Company entered into the GE Biopharma Purchase Agreement with GE to acquire the GE Biopharma Business for a cash purchase price of approximately $21.0 billion, subject to certain adjustments, and the assumption of approximately $0.4 billion of pension liabilities. The GE Biopharma Business, to be known as Cytiva following the closing of the acquisition, is a leading provider of instruments, consumables and software that support the research, discovery, process development and manufacturing workflows of biopharmaceutical drugs. Based on preliminary unaudited financial information provided by GE, the GE Biopharma Business generated revenues of approximately $3.3 billion in 2019. Though the timing of obtaining the final regulatory approvals necessary to close the GE Biopharma Acquisition is uncertain, the Company continues to make progress with respect thereto and expects to close the transaction in the first quarter of 2020. The acquisition is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Company’s Life Sciences segment by expanding the business’ geographic and product line diversity, including new product and service offerings that complement the Company’s current biologics workflow solutions. As a condition to obtaining certain regulatory approvals for the closing of the transaction, the Company expects it will be required to divest certain of its existing product lines that in the aggregate generated revenues of approximately $170 million in 2019. The Company plans to finance the GE Biopharma Acquisition with approximately $3.0 billion of proceeds from the March 1, 2019 underwritten public offerings of its Common Stock and MCPS, approximately $10.8 billion of proceeds from the issuance of euro-denominated and U.S. dollar-denominated long-term debt in the second half of 2019, and approximately $7.2 billion from the aggregate of cash on hand and proceeds from commercial paper borrowings. Refer to Note 11 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the issuance of debt and to Note 19 for additional information related to the March 1, 2019 public offerings. During 2019, the Company acquired five businesses for total consideration of $331 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company’s three segments. The aggregate annual sales of these five businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $72 million. In addition, in 2019 the Company invested $241 million in non-marketable equity securities and a partnership.For a discussion of the Company’s 2018 and 2017 acquisition and disposition activity, refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Investing Activities”.Envista DispositionOn September 20, 2019, Envista completed an underwritten IPO of 30.8 million shares of its common stock, (the “IPO”), which represented 19.4% of Envista’s outstanding shares at the time of the offering, at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. Envista realized net proceeds of $643 million from the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and deal expenses. In connection with the completion of the IPO, through a series of equity and other transactions, the Company transferred its dental businesses to Envista (the “Separation”). In exchange, Envista transferred consideration of approximately $2.0 billion to the Company, which consisted primarily of the net proceeds from the IPO and approximately $1.3 billion of proceeds from Envista’s term debt financing. The excess of the net proceeds from the IPO over the net book value of the business transferred to Envista was $60 million and was recorded in additional paid-in capital. On December 18, 2019, Danaher completed the disposition of its remaining 80.6% ownership of Envista common stock through a split-off exchange offer, which resulted in Danaher’s repurchase of 22.9 million shares of Danaher common stock in exchange for the remaining shares of Envista common stock held by Danaher (the “Split-Off”). The IPO, Separation and Split-Off are collectively referred to as the “Envista Disposition”. As a result, the Company recognized a gain on the disposition of $451 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 equal to the difference between the fair value of the Danaher common stock tendered in the exchange offer and the carrying value of Envista common stock. The accounting requirements for reporting Envista as a discontinued operation were met when the Split-Off was completed. Accordingly, the Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented reflect this business as a discontinued operation. For each period presented, the Company allocated a portion of the consolidated interest expense to discontinued operations based on the ratio of the discontinued business’ net assets to the 35Table of ContentsCompany’s consolidated net assets. Envista had revenues of approximately $2.6 billion in 2019 prior to the Envista Disposition and approximately $2.8 billion in 2018. To effect the Envista Disposition, the Company incurred $69 million in costs during the year ended December 31, 2019 which are reflected in earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. These costs primarily relate to professional fees associated with preparation of regulatory filings and activities within finance, tax, legal and information technology functions as well as certain investment banking fees and tax costs. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. UK’s referendum decision to exit the EU In a referendum on June 23, 2016, voters approved for the UK to exit the EU. The UK formally withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020 with a transition period through December 31, 2020. During the transition period, the UK will continue to follow EU law and will negotiate with the EU on the terms of its relationship post-2020. Failure to complete negotiations by the implementation deadline of December 31, 2020 relating to Brexit could result in the UK reverting to undesirable and adverse trade agreements with the EU. The nature of the UK’s future relationship with the EU is still uncertain. The Company continues to monitor the status of Brexit and plan for potential impacts. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had seven manufacturing facilities in the UK and the Company’s net investment in plant, property and equipment in the UK was $163 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, less than 5% of the Company’s sales were derived from customers located in the UK, however, the impact of Brexit could also impact the Company’s sales and operations outside the UK. To mitigate the potential impact of Brexit on the import of goods to the UK, the Company has increased its level of inventory within the UK. The ultimate impact of Brexit on the Company’s financial results is uncertain. For additional information, refer to the “Item 1A—Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report. CoronavirusFor information on the potential impact of the coronavirus to the Company’s operations, refer to the “Item 1A—Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report. RESULTS OF OPERATIONSIn this report, references to the non-GAAP measure of core sales (also referred to as core revenues or sales/revenues from existing businesses) refer to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) but excluding:•sales from acquired businesses; and•the impact of currency translation.References to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales and operating profit, as applicable, attributable to divested product lines not considered discontinued operations. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between:•the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses); and•the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period.Core sales growth should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting the non-GAAP financial measure of core sales growth provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in Danaher’s business and facilitating comparisons of Danaher’s revenue performance with its performance in prior and future periods and to Danaher’s peers. Management also uses core sales growth to measure the Company’s operating and financial performance, and uses it as one of the performance measures in the Company’s executive short-term cash incentive program. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from core sales because currency translation is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestiture-related items because the nature, size, timing and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period-to-period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.Throughout this discussion, references to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales and references to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies resulting from the ongoing application of DBS.36Table of ContentsCore Revenue 2019 vs. 2018 2018 vs. 2017Total sales growth (GAAP)5.0 %10.0 %Impact of: Acquisitions and other(1.0)% (2.0)%Currency exchange rates 2.0 % (1.0)%Core revenue growth (non-GAAP)6.0 % 7.0 %Core sales grew on a year-over-year basis in both 2019 and 2018. Sales from acquired businesses increased on a year-over-year basis in both 2019 and 2018, primarily due to the acquisition of IDT in the second quarter of 2018. The impact of currency translation reduced reported sales on a year-over-year basis in 2019 as the U.S. dollar was, on average, stronger against other major currencies. Currency translation increased reported sales on a year-over-year basis in 2018, primarily due to the U.S. dollar weakening against other major currencies in the first half of 2018, partially offset by the U.S. dollar strengthening in the second half of 2018.

The decline was driven by increased leverage of the Company’s general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2019 sales volumes and continuing productivity improvements taken in 2019 and 2018, partially offset by continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives and transaction costs and integration preparation costs associated with the anticipated GE Biopharma Acquisition, which increased SG&A as a percentage of sales by approximately 50 basis points during 2019. 43Table of ContentsSG&A expenses as a percentage of sales declined 90 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2018 compared with 2017. The decline was driven by increased leverage of the Company’s general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2018 sales volumes, continuing productivity improvements taken in 2018 and 2017, and the impact of the restructuring, impairment and other related charges incurred in 2017 associated with the Company’s strategic decision to discontinue a product line in its Diagnostics segment. The decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales was partially offset by higher relative spending levels at recently acquired companies and continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives. R&D expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) as a percentage of sales increased slightly in 2019 as compared with 2018, as year-over-year increases in the Company’s investments in new product development initiatives approximated the year-over-year increase in sales. R&D expenses as a percentage of sales were flat in 2018 as compared to 2017. NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) As described in Note 1 and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation— Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. The ASU requires the Company to disaggregate the service cost component from the other components of net periodic benefit costs and requires the Company to present the other components of net periodic benefit cost in other income, net. The ASU required application on a retrospective basis. The other components of net periodic benefit costs included in other income, net for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were net gains of $12 million, $35 million and $31 million, respectively. The Company’s net periodic pension cost for the year-ended December 31, 2019 includes a settlement loss of $7 million pre-tax ($6 million after-tax, or $0.01 per diluted share) as a result of the transfer of a portion of its non-U.S. pension liabilities related to one defined benefit plan to a third party. During 2017, the Company received $138 million of cash proceeds and recorded $22 million in short-term other receivables from the sale of certain marketable equity securities during 2017. The Company recorded a pretax gain related to this sale of $73 million ($46 million after-tax or $0.06 per diluted share).LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF BORROWINGSIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company redeemed the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.4% senior unsecured notes due 2020 and the $375 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes due 2020. The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of these borrowings, net of certain deferred gains, of $7 million ($5 million after-tax or $0.01 per diluted share). The Company funded the redemption using a portion of the cash distribution it received in connection with the Envista Disposition.INTEREST COSTSInterest expense of $109 million for 2019 was $28 million lower than in 2018, due primarily to the impact of the Company’s cross-currency swap derivative contracts and the repayment of certain outstanding borrowings in 2019, partially offset by interest expense from 2019 debt issuances. For a further description of the Company’s debt as of December 31, 2019 refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest expense of $137 million in 2018 was $3 million lower than the 2017 interest expense of $140 million due primarily to the decrease in interest costs as a result of the repayment of certain outstanding borrowings in the third quarter of 2018 and the second and fourth quarters of 2017, lower average outstanding U.S. commercial paper borrowings during 2018 compared to 2017, and the impact of foreign exchange rates in 2018 as compared to 2017, partially offset by the cost of additional non-U.S. debt issued during 2017.In January 2019, the Company entered into approximately $1.9 billion of cross-currency swap derivative contracts on its U.S. dollar-denominated bonds to effectively convert the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bonds to obligations denominated in Danish kroner, Japanese yen, euro and Swiss franc and reduce the interest rate from the stated interest rates on the U.S. dollar-denominated debt to the interest rates of the swaps. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $1.0 billion of the cross-currency swap derivative contracts remained outstanding. 44Table of ContentsThe Company used interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to a portion of the U.S. debt the Company issued to fund the GE Biopharma Acquisition. The interest rate swap agreements are agreements in which the Company agrees to pay a fixed interest rate based on the rate specified in the agreement in exchange for receiving a floating interest rate from a third-party bank based upon a specified benchmark interest rate. In June 2019, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $850 million. These contracts, which were settled in November 2019, effectively fixed the interest rate for a portion of the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated debt issued in November 2019 equal to the notional amount of the swaps to the rate specified in the interest rate swap agreements. The changes in the fair value of these instruments resulting from the changes in interest rates were recorded as a loss of $38 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity prior to the issuance of the debt and are subsequently being reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt. INCOME TAXESGeneralIncome tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.The Company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as further discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws and regulations, such as the TCJA and legislative policy changes that may result from the OECD’s initiative on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. For a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, refer to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash and Cash Requirements” below.The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis. Based on these reviews, the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities, tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitations, reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary. For a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted, substantially changing the U.S. tax system. Under the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB No. 118”) guidance, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded provisional amounts in earnings for the enactment of the TCJA and during 2018, the Company completed its accounting for the TCJA based on the Company’s interpretation of the new tax regulations and related guidance issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the IRS. The TCJA imposes tax on U.S. shareholders for global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company has elected the period cost method for its accounting for GILTI. Due to the complexity and recent issuance of these tax regulations, management’s interpretations of the impact of these rules could be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities.Year-Over-Year Changes in the Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate Year Ended December 31 2019 2018 2017Effective tax rate from continuing operations26.4% 18.8% 14.6%The Company’s effective tax rate for 2019, 2018 and 2017 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rates of 21.0% in 2019 and 2018 and 35.0% in 2017, due principally to the Company’s earnings outside the United States that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates different than the U.S. federal statutory rate. In addition: •The effective tax rate of 26.4% in 2019 includes 650 basis points of net tax charges related primarily to changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions, audit settlements, and Envista Disposition costs, net of the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation, release of valuation 45Table of Contentsallowances associated with certain foreign tax credits, tax benefits resulting from changes in tax law and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.•The effective tax rate of 18.8% in 2018 includes 120 basis points of tax benefits primarily related to the release of reserves upon the expiration of statutes of limitation, audit settlements and release of a valuation allowance in a certain foreign tax jurisdiction. These tax benefits were partially offset by additional provisions related to completing the accounting for the enactment of the TCJA and tax costs directly related to reorganization activities associated with the Envista Disposition. •The effective tax rate of 14.6% in 2017 includes 560 basis points of net tax benefits due to the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities from 35.0% to 21.0% due to the TCJA and the release of reserves upon statute of limitation expiration, partially offset by income tax expense related to the Transition Tax on foreign earnings due to the TCJA and changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions. The Company conducts business globally, and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. The non-U.S. countries in which the Company has a significant presence include China, Denmark, Germany, Singapore, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The Company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements given the geographic dispersion of the Company’s taxable income. The Company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities. The IRS has completed substantially all of the examinations of the Company’s federal income tax returns through 2011 and is currently examining certain of the Company’s federal income tax returns for 2012 through 2017. In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and various other countries, states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2004 through 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, the IRS proposed significant adjustments to the Company’s taxable income for the years 2012 through 2015 with respect to the deferral of tax on certain premium income related to the Company’s self-insurance programs. For income tax purposes, the recognition of premium income has been deferred in accordance with U.S. tax laws related to insurance. The IRS is challenging the deferral of premiums for certain types of the Company’s self-insurance policies. The proposed adjustments would increase the Company’s taxable income over the 2012 through 2015 period by approximately $2.7 billion. Management believes the positions the Company has taken in its U.S. tax returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and intends to vigorously defend these positions. Due to the enactment of the TCJA in 2017 and the resulting reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate for years after 2017, the Company revalued its deferred tax liabilities related to the temporary differences associated with this deferred premium income from 35.0% to 21.0%. If the Company is not successful in defending these assessments, the taxes owed to the IRS may be computed under the previous 35.0% statutory tax rate and the Company may be required to revalue the related deferred tax liabilities from 21.0% to 35.0%, which in addition to any interest due on the amounts assessed, would require a charge to future earnings. The ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, could take many years and could result in a material adverse impact to the Company’s financial statements, including its cash flows and effective tax rate. Tax authorities in Denmark have raised significant issues related to interest accrued by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. On December 10, 2013, the Company received assessments from the Danish tax authority (“SKAT”) of approximately DKK 1.8 billion (approximately $266 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2019) including interest through December 31, 2019, imposing withholding tax relating to interest accrued in Denmark on borrowings from certain of the Company’s subsidiaries for the years 2004-2009. The Company appealed these assessments to the Danish National Tax Tribunal in 2014. The appeal is pending, awaiting the final outcome of other, preceding withholding tax cases that were appealed to the Danish courts and subsequently to the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”). In February 2019, the CJEU decided several of these cases and ruled that the exemption of interest payments from withholding taxes provided in the applicable EU directive should be denied where taxpayers use the directive for abusive or fraudulent purposes, and that it is up to the national courts to make this determination. This decision of the CJEU now awaits application by the Danish High Court in the other, preceding withholding tax cases. SKAT has maintained a similar position related to withholding tax on interest accrued in Denmark on borrowings from certain of the Company’s subsidiaries with respect to tax years 2010-2012 and 2013-2015. On August 27, 2019 and December 16, 2019, the Company received assessments for these matters of approximately DKK 1.1 billion including interest through December 31, 2019 (approximately $159 million based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2019) for tax years 2010-2012 and DKK 751 million including interest through December 31, 2019 (approximately $113 million based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2019) for tax years 2013-2015, respectively. The Company is appealing these assessments as well. 46Table of ContentsManagement believes the positions the Company has taken in Denmark are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and is vigorously defending its positions. The Company intends on pursuing this matter through the Danish High Court should the appeal to the Danish National Tax Tribunal be unsuccessful. The Company will continue to monitor decisions of both the Danish courts and the CJEU and evaluate the impact of these court rulings on the Company’s tax positions in Denmark. The ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, could take many years, and could result in a material adverse impact to the Company’s financial statements, including its cash flow and effective tax rate.The Company expects its 2020 effective tax rate to be approximately 19.5%. Any future legislative changes in the United States including potential tax reform in other jurisdictions, could cause the Company’s effective tax rate to differ from this estimate. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to income taxes.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS As further discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, discontinued operations include the results of Envista which was disposed of during the fourth quarter of 2019 as well as an income tax benefit in 2017 related to the Fortive businesses that were disposed of during the third quarter of 2016. In 2019, earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, were $576 million and reflect the operating results of Envista prior to the Envista Disposition and a gain on the disposition of Envista of $451 million, net of certain costs associated with the Envista Disposition including costs related to establishing Envista as a stand-alone entity and legal, accounting and investment banking fees. In 2018 and 2017, earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, were $245 million and $320 million, respectively, and reflect the operations of Envista as well as a $22 million income tax benefit in 2017 related to the release of previously provided reserves associated with uncertain tax positions on certain Danaher tax returns which were jointly filed with Fortive entities. These reserves were released due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for those returns. All Fortive entity-related balances are included in the income tax benefit related to discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEComprehensive income increased by approximately $726 million in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to a decrease in losses from foreign currency translation adjustments in 2019 compared to 2018 and higher net earnings (including those attributable to discontinued operations) partially offset by an increase in losses from pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments in 2019 compared to 2018 and losses from cash flow hedge adjustments in 2019. The Company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $75 million for 2019 compared to a translation loss of $632 million for 2018. The Company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit loss of $90 million for 2019 compared to a loss of $13 million for 2018. The Company recorded losses from cash flow hedge adjustments in 2019 of $113 million.Comprehensive income decreased by approximately $1.5 billion in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to a loss from foreign currency translation adjustments in 2018 compared to a gain in 2017 and a loss from pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments in 2018 as compared to a gain in 2017, partially offset by higher net earnings (including those attributable to discontinued operations) and a decrease in unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities in 2018 compared to 2017. The Company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $632 million for 2018 compared to a translation gain of $976 million for 2017. The Company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit loss of $13 million in 2018 compared to a gain of $71 million in 2017. INFLATIONThe effect of inflation on the Company’s revenues and net earnings was not significant in any of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017.FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENTThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices as well as credit risk, each of which could impact its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. The Company also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign exchange risks and interest rate risks. In addition, the Company’s broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole.47Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskThe Company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. A change in interest rates on fixed rate long-term debt impacts the fair value of the debt but not the Company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2019, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt (excluding the LYONs, which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from the value of its underlying common stock) by approximately $1.7 billion.As of December 31, 2019, the Company’s variable-rate debt obligations consisted primarily of euro-based commercial paper borrowings (refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2019). As a result, the Company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term interest rates. As these shorter duration obligations mature, the Company may issue additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. In 2019, the average annual interest rate associated with outstanding commercial paper borrowings was approximately negative 19 basis points. A hypothetical increase of this average to negative 12 basis points would have increased the Company’s annual interest expense by $2 million. The hypothetical increase used is the actual amount by which the Company’s commercial paper interest rates fluctuated during 2019.Refer to “Results of Operations—Interest Costs” for discussion of the Company’s cross-currency swap derivative contracts and interest rate swap agreements.Currency Exchange Rate RiskThe Company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than Danaher’s functional currency or the functional currency of its applicable subsidiary. The Company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign operations into U.S. dollars, Danaher’s functional currency. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the Company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of stockholders’ equity. Currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2019 reported sales by 2.0% on a year-over-year basis, primarily as a result of the U.S. dollar strengthening against other major currencies. If the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2019 were to prevail throughout 2020, currency exchange rates would slightly increase 2020 estimated sales relative to 2019 sales. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies compared to the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2019 would adversely impact the Company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis. Any weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies compared to the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2019 would positively impact the Company’s sales and results of operations.The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this transactional exchange risk, although the Company has used foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps to hedge a portion of its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales and net earnings in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, the Company has assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies. A 10% depreciation in major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2019 would have reduced foreign currency-denominated net assets and stockholders’ equity by approximately $830 million. In 2019, the Company entered into approximately $1.9 billion of cross-currency swap derivative contracts on its U.S. dollar-denominated bonds to hedge its net investment in foreign operations against adverse changes in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Danish kroner, Japanese yen, euro and the Swiss franc. These contracts effectively convert the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bonds to obligations denominated in Danish kroner, Japanese yen, euro and Swiss franc, and partially offset the impact of changes in currency rates on foreign currency-denominated net assets during the term of the swap. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $1.0 billion of the cross-currency swap derivative contracts remained outstanding. The Company also uses cross-currency swap derivative contracts to hedge U.S. dollar-denominated long-term debt issuances in a foreign subsidiary whose functional currency is the euro against adverse movements in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro. In November 2019, the Company entered into cross-currency swap derivative contracts with respect to 48Table of Contentsapproximately $4.0 billion of its U.S. dollar-denominated bonds and all of these derivative contracts remained outstanding as of December 31, 2019.Equity Price RiskThe Company’s investment portfolio from time to time includes publicly-traded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price, though as of December 31, 2019, the Company held no available-for-sale marketable equity securities. The Company holds non-marketable equity investments in privately held companies that may be impacted by equity price risks or other factors. These non-marketable equity investments are accounted for under the Fair Value Alternative method with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. Volatility in the equity markets or other fair value considerations could affect the value of these investments and require charges or gains to be recognized in earnings. Commodity Price RiskFor a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”Credit RiskThe Company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, receivables from customers and derivatives. The Company places cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the Company’s customers. The Company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as deemed appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when deemed appropriate.The Company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and typically with high-quality financial institutions, so that exposure at any one institution is limited.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESManagement assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and forecasts that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses, consummating strategic acquisitions and investments, paying interest and servicing debt and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. In addition, as discussed in further detail above, the Company received approximately $2.0 billion of cash from Envista as consideration for the transfer of the Company’s dental businesses to Envista, a portion of which consideration the Company used to redeem certain of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness in the fourth quarter of 2019.49Table of ContentsFollowing is an overview of the Company’s cash flows and liquidity for the years ended December 31:Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity($ in millions)2019 2018 2017Total operating cash flows provided by continuing operations$3,657.4 $3,644.0 $3,122.2 Cash paid for acquisitions$(331.3) $(2,173.3) $(385.8)Payments for additions to property, plant and equipment(635.5) (583.5) (570.7)Proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment12.8 6.3 32.5Payments for purchases of investments(241.0) (145.9) —Proceeds from sales of investments— 22.2 137.9All other investing activities28.9 0.3 (2.4)Total investing cash used in discontinued operations(72.0) (75.5) (54.9)Net cash used in investing activities$(1,238.1) $(2,949.4) $(843.4) Proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with stock-based compensation$130.1 $96.0 $68.8Proceeds from the public offering of common stock, net of issuance costs1,443.2 — —Proceeds from the public offering of preferred stock, net of issuance costs1,599.6 — —Net proceeds from the sale of Envista Holdings Corporation common stock, net of issuance costs643.4 — —Payment of dividends(526.7) (433.4) (378.3)Payment for purchase of noncontrolling interest— — (64.4)Net proceeds from (repayments of) borrowings (maturities of 90 days or less)2,801.8 65.7 (3,778.5)Proceeds from borrowings (maturities longer than 90 days)12,112.8 — 1,782.1Repayments of borrowings (maturities longer than 90 days)(1,564.5) (507.8) (668.4)Make-whole premiums to redeem borrowings prior to maturity(6.5) — —All other financing activities(43.3) (17.9) (59.8)Cash distributions to Envista Holdings Corporation, net(224.0) — —Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$16,365.9 $(797.4) $(3,098.5)•Operating cash flows from continuing operations increased $13 million, or less than 1%, during 2019 as compared to 2018, due primarily to higher net earnings, which included higher noncash charges for depreciation, amortization, and stock compensation, and the impact of a noncash discrete income tax charge in 2019, net of higher cash used for funding trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable in 2019 compared to 2018. In addition, lower cash used for payments for various employee-related liabilities, customer funding and accrued expenses increased operating cash flows from continuing operations in 2019 compared to 2018.•On March 1, 2019, the Company completed the underwritten public offering of 12.1 million shares of Danaher common stock at a price to the public of $123.00 per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion, after deducting expenses and the underwriters’ discount. Simultaneously, the Company completed the underwritten public offering of 1.65 million shares of its MCPS resulting in net proceeds of approximately $1.6 billion, after deducting expenses and the underwriters’ discount. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the underwritten public offerings of its Common Stock and MCPS (the “Common Stock Offering” and “MCPS Offering”, respectively) to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable for, and certain costs associated with, the GE Biopharma Acquisition.•In the second half of 2019, the Company issued approximately €6.2 billion of senior unsecured euronotes and approximately $4.0 billion of senior unsecured notes. The proceeds from these issuances will be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable for the GE Biopharma Acquisition. 50Table of Contents•On December 18, 2019, Danaher completed the Envista Disposition. Prior to the IPO, Envista borrowed $650 million under a senior unsecured term loan and €600 million under a three-year, senior unsecured term loan facility. Envista transferred the net proceeds from these borrowings along with the net proceeds of $643 million from the Envista IPO to the Company in consideration for the Company’s transfer of the dental businesses to Envista.•Danaher used a portion of the consideration received from Envista to redeem $882 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness in the fourth quarter of 2019 (consisting of the Company’s 2.4% senior unsecured notes due 2020 and 5.0% senior unsecured notes due 2020 (collectively the “Redeemed Notes”)), as well as the make-whole premiums and accrued and unpaid interest required to be paid in connection with such redemptions. The Company used the balance of the consideration it received from Envista to redeem commercial paper borrowings as they matured.•Net cash used in investing activities during 2019 consisted primarily of cash paid for acquisitions, additions to property, plant and equipment and payments for purchases of investments. The Company acquired five businesses during 2019 for total consideration (including assumed debt and net of cash acquired) of $331 million. Payments for additions to property, plant and equipment increased $52 million in 2019 compared to 2018 and included investments in operating assets and new facilities. In addition, in 2019, the Company invested $241 million in non-marketable equity securities and a partnership.•As of December 31, 2019, the Company held approximately $19.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents.Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities and productivity improvement initiatives, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows.Operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $3.7 billion for 2019, an increase of $13 million, or less than 1%, as compared to 2018. The year-over-year change in operating cash flows from 2018 to 2019 was primarily attributable to the following factors:•2019 operating cash flows benefited from higher net earnings in 2019 as compared to 2018. Net earnings for 2019 include noncash discrete income tax charges totaling $215 million, which decreased net earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows.•Net earnings for 2019 reflected an increase of $12 million of depreciation and amortization expense as compared to 2018. Amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions and increased due to recently acquired businesses. Depreciation expense relates to both the Company’s manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operating-type lease arrangements and increased due primarily to the impact of increased capital expenditures. Depreciation and amortization are noncash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows.•The aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable used $160 million in operating cash flows during 2019, compared to $41 million of operating cash flows provided in 2018. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively the Company manages the cash conversion cycle, which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day it pays for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from its customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period.•The aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets, deferred income taxes and accrued expenses and other liabilities provided $37 million in operating cash flows during 2019, compared to $121 million used in 2018. The noncash discrete tax charge, the timing of cash payments for taxes, various employee-related liabilities, customer funding and accrued expenses drove the majority of this change.Operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $3.6 billion for 2018, an increase of $522 million, or 17%, as compared to 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in net earnings from continuing operations in 2018 as compared to 2017. Net earnings in 2017 also included a $73 million gain on sale of marketable equity securities for which the proceeds were reflected in the investing activities section of the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and therefore, did not contribute to operating cash flows. 51Table of ContentsInvesting ActivitiesCash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures, including instruments leased to customers, cash used for investments and cash proceeds from divestitures of businesses or assets.Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $1.2 billion during 2019 compared to approximately $2.9 billion and $843 million of net cash used in 2018 and 2017, respectively.Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of InvestmentsFor a discussion of the Company’s 2019 acquisitions refer to “—Overview.” In addition, in 2019, the Company invested $241 million in non-marketable equity securities and partnerships. During 2018, the Company acquired two businesses for total consideration of approximately $2.2 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of the Company’s Life Sciences and Environmental & Applied Solutions segments. The aggregate annual sales of these two businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the companies’ revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $313 million.In addition, in 2018, the Company invested $146 million in non-marketable equity securities and partnerships. The Company received cash proceeds of $22 million from the collection of short-term other receivables related to the sale of certain marketable equity securities during 2017.During 2017, the Company acquired nine businesses for total consideration of $386 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of the Life Sciences and Environmental & Applied Solutions segments. The aggregate annual sales of these nine businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the companies’ revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $160 million.The Company received $138 million of cash proceeds and recorded $22 million in short-term other receivables from the sale of certain marketable equity securities during 2017. The Company recorded a pretax gain related to this sale of $73 million ($46 million after-tax or $0.06 per diluted share).Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development, improving information technology systems and the manufacture of instruments that are used in operating-type lease arrangements that certain of the Company’s businesses enter into with customers. Capital expenditures totaled $636 million in 2019 and $584 million in 2018. The year-over-year increase in capital spending in 2019 was due to increased investments in operating assets and new facilities across the Company. In 2020, the Company expects capital spending to be approximately $700 million, though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions.Financing ActivitiesCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, issuance and repurchases of common stock, issuance of preferred stock, payments of cash dividends to shareholders and proceeds from the Envista IPO. Financing activities provided cash of approximately $16.4 billion during 2019 compared to $797 million of cash used during 2018. The year-over-year increase in cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to the public offerings of the Company’s common and preferred stock during the first quarter of 2019, the issuance of debt by the Company in the second half of 2019, the proceeds received from the Envista IPO and Envista debt issuances, and net proceeds from commercial paper borrowings in 2019 compared to 2018. These sources of liquidity were partially offset by higher debt redemptions during 2019 compared to 2018 which included the impact of the early extinguishment of $882 million of borrowings through the use of the proceeds received from Envista as part of the disposition of this business.Financing activities used cash of $797 million during 2018 compared to approximately $3.1 billion of cash used during 2017. The year-over-year decrease in cash used in financing activities was due primarily to lower net repayments of commercial paper borrowings in 2018, as the Company decreased its commercial paper borrowings in 2017 after increasing commercial paper borrowings for the Cepheid acquisition in 2016. The Company issued commercial paper early in 2018 to pay for a portion of the acquisition price of IDT and repaid substantially all of such commercial paper borrowings later in 2018. The cash outflow in 2017 for the net repayment of commercial paper was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of long-term notes. In both 2018 and 2017, the Company repaid long-term debt, including $500 million aggregate principal amount of U.S. Notes with accrued interest that matured in September 2018. 52Table of ContentsTotal debt was approximately $21.7 billion and $9.7 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company had the ability to incur approximately $4.9 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under the Company’s $10.0 billion of credit facilities which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2019. The Company has classified approximately $5.0 billion of its borrowings outstanding under the euro-denominated commercial paper program as of December 31, 2019 as long-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company has the intent and ability, as supported by availability under the revolving credit facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date. As commercial paper obligations mature, the Company may issue additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. Under the Company’s U.S. and euro-denominated commercial paper program, the notes are typically issued at a discount from par, generally based on the ratings assigned to the Company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to LIBOR or EURIBOR. Additionally, the Company’s floating rate senior unsecured notes due 2022 pay interest based upon the three-month EURIBOR plus 0.3%. In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the intent to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. The Company has evaluated the anticipated impact of the transition from LIBOR and does not expect the transition to be material to the Company’s financial position. Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company’s financing activities and indebtedness, including the Company’s outstanding debt as of December 31, 2019, and the Company’s commercial paper program and related credit facilities.Common Stock Offering and MCPS OfferingFor a description of the first quarter 2019 Common Stock and MCPS Offerings, refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Shelf Registration StatementThe Company has filed a “well-known seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance. The Company expects to use net proceeds realized by the Company from future securities sales off this shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, including without limitation repayment or refinancing of debt or other corporate obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends and/or working capital.Stock Repurchase ProgramPlease see “Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Item 5 of Part II of this Annual Report for a description of the Company’s stock repurchase program.DividendsThe Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share of Company common stock that was paid on January 31, 2020 to holders of record on December 27, 2019. In addition, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $11.875 per MCPS that was paid on January 15, 2020 to holders of record as of December 31, 2019. Aggregate cash payments for dividends on Company common stock during 2019 were $478 million. The year-over-year increase in dividend payments on common stock in 2019 results from increases in the quarterly dividend rate effective with respect to the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2019. Aggregate cash payments for dividends on the MCPS during 2019 were $49 million.Cash and Cash RequirementsAs of December 31, 2019, the Company held approximately $19.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment-grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an approximate weighted average annual interest rate of 1.5%. Of this amount, approximately $16.3 billion was held within the United States and approximately $3.6 billion was held outside of the United States. The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments, pay interest and service debt, pay taxes and any related interest or penalties, fund its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock and support other business needs. The Company generally intends to use available 53Table of Contentscash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, particularly in connection with acquisitions (including the GE Biopharma Acquisition), the Company may also borrow under its commercial paper programs or credit facilities, enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper programs and/or issue debt and/or equity in the capital markets. The Company also may from time to time access the capital markets to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions. For a description of the Company’s anticipated financing of the GE Biopharma Acquisition, refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. While repatriation of some cash held outside the United States may be restricted by local laws, most of the Company’s foreign cash could be repatriated to the United States. Following enactment of the TCJA and the associated Transition Tax, in general, repatriation of cash to the United States can be completed with no incremental U.S. tax; however, repatriation of cash could subject the Company to non-U.S. jurisdictional taxes on distributions. The cash that the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations, investments and acquisitions. The income taxes applicable to repatriating such earnings are not readily determinable. As of December 31, 2019, the Company continues to assert that principally all of its non-U.S. earnings are indefinitely reinvested and management believes that the Company has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs, including its cash needs in the United States.During 2019, the Company contributed $10 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans and $44 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2020, the Company’s cash contribution requirements for its U.S. and its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately $95 million and $40 million, respectively. The ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan’s funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates and other factors.Contractual ObligationsThe following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 under (1) debt obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amounts presented in the “Other long-term liabilities” line in the table below include approximately $1.3 billion of noncurrent gross unrecognized tax benefits and related interest (and do not include $58 million of current gross unrecognized tax benefits which are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet). The timing of the long-term portion of these tax liabilities is uncertain, and therefore, they have been included in the “More Than 5 Years” column in the table below. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits. Certain of the Company’s acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table below does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts of any such payments are uncertain. Refer to “—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” for a discussion of other contractual obligations that are not reflected in the table below.($ in millions)Total Less ThanOne Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than5 YearsDebt and leases: Debt obligations (a)(b)$21,714.9 $211.3 $2,160.4 $6,237.3 $13,105.9Capital lease obligations (b)14.2 1.1 13.1 — —Total debt and leases21,729.1 212.4 2,173.5 6,237.3 13,105.9Interest payments on debt and capital lease obligations (c)3,041.1 256.5 488.3 443.1 1,853.2Operating lease obligations (d)888.2 179.5 267.4 196.4 244.9Other: Purchase obligations (e)594.3 545.1 46.8 2.1 0.3Other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet (f)4,711.8 — 625.1 482.6 3,604.1Total$30,964.5 $1,193.5 $3,601.1 $7,361.5 $18,808.4(a) As described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(b) Amounts do not include interest payments. Interest on debt and capital lease obligations is reflected in a separate line in the table.(c) Interest payments on debt are projected for future periods using the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2019. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates.54Table of Contents(d) Amounts reflect undiscounted future operating lease payments under Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), while the current and long-term operating lease liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet reflect the discounted future operating lease payments. Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (e) Consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding on the Company, and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction.(f) Primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies and allowances, performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs, self-insurance and litigation claims, postretirement benefits, pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities and deferred compensation obligations. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management’s estimates over the terms of these arrangements and is largely based upon historical experience. Other long-term liabilities reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet include the above amounts as well as the long-term operating lease liabilities, which are reflected on a discounted basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsGuarantees and Related InstrumentsThe following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of guarantees and related instruments of the Company as of December 31, 2019. Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period($ in millions)Total Less ThanOne Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than5 YearsGuarantees and related instruments$575.7 $498.4 $56.9 $11.1 $9.3Guarantees and related instruments consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit, bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds. These have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors, customers, insurance providers, financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure the Company’s obligations and/or performance requirements related to specific transactions.Other Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters or tax matters. In particular, in connection with the 2019 Envista Disposition, the 2016 Fortive Disposition and the 2015 Communications disposition, Danaher entered into separation and related agreements pursuant to which Danaher agreed to indemnify the other parties against certain damages and expenses that might occur in the future. These indemnification obligations cover a variety of liabilities, including, but not limited to, employee, tax and environmental matters. The Company has not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they generally relate to unknown conditions and the Company cannot estimate the potential liabilities from such matters, but the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. In addition, as a result of these divestitures, as well as restructuring activities, certain properties leased by the Company have been sublet to third parties. In the event any of these third parties vacate any of these premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by such sub-lessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the Company’s financial statements.In the normal course of business, the Company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers, suppliers or other business partners for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the Company’s products, software or services or claims alleging that Company products or services infringe third-party intellectual property. The Company has not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual obligations table above. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations.The Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the Company, or by reason of serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to limited exceptions. Danaher’s Amended and Restated By-laws provide for similar indemnification rights. In addition, Danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of Danaher Corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which Danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding. While the Company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage.55Table of ContentsLegal ProceedingsRefer to “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies, and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESManagement’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience, the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments.The Company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period-to-period. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Acquired Intangibles—The Company’s business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill, in-process R&D and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the Company may incur. Refer to Notes 1, 3 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s policies relating to goodwill, acquired intangibles and acquisitions.In performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market-based approach. In evaluating the estimates derived by the market-based approach, management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected. In certain circumstances the Company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (i.e., an income approach) in order to validate the results of the market approach. The discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had five reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment. Management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units generally decreases as these businesses are integrated into the Company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2019 indicated that in all instances, the fair values of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 85% to approximately 600%. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this hypothetical 10% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 65% to approximately 530%.The Company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The Company also tests intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. These analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues, expenses, market conditions and discount rates related to these assets.If actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the Company’s financial statements. Historically, the Company’s estimates of goodwill and intangible assets have been materially correct.56Table of ContentsContingent Liabilities—As discussed in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). The Company recognizes a liability for any legal contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors, including those discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If the reserves established by the Company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s financial statements.Revenue Recognition—The Company derives revenues from the sale of products and services. Revenue is recognized when control over the promised products or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In determining if control has transferred, the Company considers whether certain indicators of the transfer of control are present, such as the transfer of title, present right to payment, significant risks and rewards of ownership and customer acceptance when acceptance is not a formality. To determine the consideration that the customer owes the Company, the Company must make judgments regarding the amount of customer allowances and rebates, as well as an estimate for product returns. The Company also enters into lease arrangements with customers which requires the Company to determine whether the arrangements are operating or sales-type leases. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s revenue recognition policies.If the Company’s judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect, the Company’s reported revenues in particular periods may be incorrect. Historically, the Company’s estimates of revenue have been materially correct.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits—For a description of the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit accounting practices, refer to Notes 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations, including assumptions regarding discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rates of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates and other factors. If the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change (as a result of differences in actual experience, changes in key economic indicators or other factors) the Company’s financial statements could be materially affected. A 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the U.S. net obligation by $133 million ($99 million on an after-tax basis) and the non-U.S. net obligation by $137 million ($116 million on an after-tax basis) from the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2019. A 50 basis point increase in the discount rates used for the plans would have decreased the U.S. net obligation by $122 million ($91 million on an after-tax basis) and the non-U.S. net obligation by $124 million ($105 million on an after-tax basis) from the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2019.For 2019, the estimated long-term rate of return for the U.S. plans was 7.0%, and the Company intends to continue to use an assumption of 7.0% for 2020. The estimated long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plans was determined on a plan-by-plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 0.8% to 5.0%. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2019 was reduced by 50 basis points, pension expense for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans for 2019 would have increased $9 million ($7 million on an after-tax basis) and $5 million ($4 million on an after-tax basis), respectively.For a discussion of the Company’s 2019 and anticipated 2020 defined benefit pension plan contributions, refer to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash and Cash Requirements”.Income Taxes—For a description of the Company’s income tax accounting policies, refer to Notes 1 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. This requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding: (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. Future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial statements. The Company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when, based upon the technical merits, it is “more likely than not” that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. Judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions. The Company re-evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances, including when: (1) a tax audit is completed; (2) applicable tax laws change, including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (3) the applicable statute of limitations expires.57Table of ContentsIn addition, certain of the Company’s tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in Denmark and the United States (refer to “—Results of Operations—Income Taxes” and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws. However, the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in the Company being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact to the Company’s financial statements, including its effective tax rate.An increase of 1.0% in the Company’s 2019 nominal tax rate would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $33 million.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSFor a discussion of the new accounting standards impacting the Company, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.ITEM 7A.

Danaher’s internet site and the information contained on or connected to that site are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, economic conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws, regulations or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns including epidemics, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business and financial statements, including our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and stock price.15Business and Strategic RisksThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and continues to pose risks to, certain elements of our business and our financial statements, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19. The global spread of COVID-19 has led to unprecedented restrictions on, and disruptions in, business and personal activities, including as a result of preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses, our communities and governments are taking to mitigate the spread. For example, many governments have issued “stay-at-home” orders which restrict business and personal activities, and many employers are requiring employees to work from home. In addition to existing travel and activity restrictions, jurisdictions may continue to close borders, impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and other activities. The pandemic has caused a global recession of potentially extended duration.The direct impact of COVID-19 and the preventive and precautionary measures implemented as a result thereof have adversely affected, and are expected to continue to adversely affect, certain elements of our Company (including to a different degree our operations, commercial organizations, supply chains and distribution systems) and the future impact may be material, though the impact on our different businesses and the different elements of our businesses varies (please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of how COVID-19 impacted our results of operations and financial position in 2020). Without limiting the foregoing, we have experienced and/or may in the future experience:•adverse impacts on customer orders and purchases and unpredictable reductions in demand for many of our products;•constraints on the movement of our products through the supply chain;•adverse impacts on our collections of accounts receivable, including delays in collections and increases in uncollectible receivables;•supply chain capacity constraints and price increases, including with respect to freight services;•adverse impacts on our workforce and/or key employees;•unpredictable increases in demand for certain products; and•increased cybersecurity attack activity.In an effort to optimize availability of needed medical and other supplies and products in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we may elect to or governments may require us or our customers to allocate manufacturing capacity (for example pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act (“DPA”)) in a way that adversely affects our financial condition and results of operations, results in differential treatment of customers and/or adversely affects our reputation and customer relationships. For example, certain of our customers are or have been subject to DPA requirements relating to the production of COVID-19 related products and have required certain of our businesses to also comply with these requirements under our supply agreements. Further, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”) of the U.S. government has agreed to finance an expansion of production capacity at one of our businesses for COVID-19 related products, and in connection therewith the business has committed certain of such incremental production capacity to the U.S. government pursuant to the DPA. In addition, unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products can exceed our capacity to meet such demand on a timely basis or at all, which can result in negative publicity and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial statements. The accelerated development and production of products and services in an effort to address medical and other requirements as a result of the pandemic also increases the risk of regulatory enforcement actions, product defects or claims thereof. In addition, the COVID-19 vaccines that are developed may not all use Danaher’s vaccine development/production solutions, and/or may use Danaher’s solutions to different degrees; and if the number of COVID-19 vaccines under development declines (for example because one or a limited number of vaccines emerges as the preferred solution) the demand for Danaher’s vaccine development/production solutions may decline. Danaher’s COVID-19 testing solutions may also not ultimately be the preferred testing solutions for COVID-19. Any of these developments may adversely affect our business and financial statements.Although we successfully issued debt and equity in underwritten offerings in 2020, COVID-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which has increased the cost of, and adversely impacted access to, capital (including in the commercial paper markets) and increased economic uncertainty. There are no assurances that the commercial paper markets or the capital markets will be available to us in the future or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations.16While the pandemic continues we expect to experience continued adverse impacts on our business and financial statements, which adverse impacts are unpredictable and may be material. Even to the extent COVID-19 conditions begin to improve, the duration and sustainability of any such improvements will be uncertain and continuing adverse impacts and/or the degree of improvement may vary dramatically by geography and line of business. The actions Danaher’s businesses take in response to any improvements in conditions may vary widely by geography and line of business and will likely be made with incomplete information; pose the risk that such actions may prove to be premature, incorrect or insufficient; and could have a material, adverse impact on our business and financial statements. In addition, any restructuring activities we undertake in light of the COVID-19 impact may adversely affect our business and financial statements.Conditions in the global economy, the particular markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our business is sensitive to general economic conditions. Slower economic growth in the domestic and/or international markets, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt, volatility in the currency and credit markets, high levels of unemployment or underemployment, reduced levels of capital expenditures, changes or anticipation of potential changes in government trade, fiscal, tax and monetary policies, changes in capital requirements for financial institutions, government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics, sequestration, austerity measures and other challenges that affect the global economy have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, the Company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, including having the effect of:•reducing demand for our products and services (in this Annual Report, references to products and services also includes software), limiting the financing available to our customers and suppliers, increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies;•increasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories;•increasing price competition in our served markets; •supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; •increasing the risk of impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, and the risk that we may not be able to fully recover the value of other assets such as real estate and tax assets; •increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which, in addition to increasing the risks identified above, could result in preference actions against us; and•adversely impacting market sizes and growth rates.If growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period, if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve, our business and financial statements could be adversely affected.17We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share. Even if we compete effectively, we may be required to reduce the prices we charge.Our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. Because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors; refer to “Item 1. Business—Competition” for additional details. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets, including high-growth markets. Our ability to compete can also be impacted by changing customer preferences and requirements (for example increased demand for products incorporating digital capabilities or more environmentally-friendly products and supplier practices) as well as changes in the way healthcare services are delivered (including the movement of some care from acute to non-acute settings and increased focus on chronic disease management). Cost containment efforts by governments and the private sector, particularly in the healthcare industry, are also resulting in increased emphasis on products that reduce costs and improve efficiency and effectiveness. In addition, significant shifts in industry market share have occurred and may in the future occur in connection with product problems, safety alerts and publications about products, reflecting the competitive significance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems in our industry. Our failure to compete effectively and/or pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our business and financial statements, and our expansion into new markets may result in greater-than-expected risks, liabilities and expenses. In addition, the Company’s competitors and customers have from time to time introduced, and may in the future introduce, private label, generic or low-cost products that compete with the Company’s products at lower price points. Competitors’ products can capture significant market share or lead to a decrease in market prices overall, resulting in an adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial statements.Our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation.We generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis, our offerings will become obsolete over time and our business and financial statements will suffer. Our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to:•correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;•allocate our R&D funding to products and services with higher growth prospects;•anticipate and respond to our competitors’ development of new products and services and technological innovations;•differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings and avoid commoditization;•innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets;•obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies before our competitors do;•successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time;•obtain necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope (including with respect to medical device products by demonstrating satisfactory clinical results where applicable, as well as achieving third-party reimbursement); and•stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies.If we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in R&D of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our business and financial statements. Even when we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we often incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. In addition, promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, uncertainty over third-party reimbursement or entrenched patterns of clinical practice. Competitors may also develop after-market services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products.18The health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce (and increase the predictability of) costs, which can adversely affect our business and financial statements.The health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce (and increase the predictability of) costs, including the following:•many of our customers, and the end-users to whom our customers supply products, rely on government funding of and reimbursement for healthcare products and services and research activities. The PPACA, health care austerity measures in other countries and other potential healthcare reform changes and government austerity measures have reduced and may further reduce the amount of government funding or reimbursement available to customers or end-users of our products and services and/or the volume of medical procedures using our products and services. For example, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, introduced a multi-year pricing program for services payable under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (“CLFS”) that is designed to bring Medicare allowable amounts in line with the amounts paid by private payers. It is still unclear whether and to what extent these new rates will affect overall pricing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing services, but to the extent our customers conclude that Medicare reimbursement for these services is inadequate, it can in turn adversely impact the prices at which we sell our products. Other countries, as well as some private payors, also control the price of health care products, directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing or coverage limitations, tying reimbursement to outcomes or (in the case of governmental entities) through compulsory licensing. Global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement.•governmental and private health care providers and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the delivery of healthcare services, centralizing purchasing, limiting the number of vendors that may participate in purchasing programs, forming group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks and pursuing consolidation to improve their purchasing leverage and using competitive bid processes to procure healthcare products and services. Payors are also seeking to improve price predictability in an effort to mitigate exposure to future price increases.These changes as well as other impacts from market demand, government regulations, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures are changing the way healthcare is delivered, reimbursed and funded and have in the past and could in the future cause participants in the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services, reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products and services from governmental agencies or third-party payors, heighten clinical data requirements, reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services, affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products and increase our compliance and other costs. In addition, we may be excluded from important market segments or unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us, and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability. All of the factors described above can adversely affect our business and financial statements.International economic, political, legal, compliance, social and business factors can negatively affect our business and financial statements.In 2020, approximately 61% of our sales were derived from customers outside the United States. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located outside the United States. Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the United States and increase the localization of our products and services, we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the United States, particularly in the high-growth markets. Our international business (and particularly our business in high-growth markets) is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations, including:•interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers; •differences in terms of sale, including longer payment terms than are typical in the United States;•local product preferences and product requirements;•changes in a country’s or region’s political, social or economic conditions, such as the devaluation of particular currencies;•trade protection measures, embargoes and import or export restrictions and requirements;•unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws;19•capital controls and limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash;•the potential for nationalization of enterprises;•changes in local healthcare delivery, payment and reimbursement policies and programs;•limitations on legal rights and our ability to enforce such rights;•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;•differing labor or employment regulations;•difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis; •differing protection of intellectual property; and•greater uncertainty, risk, expense and delay in commercializing products in certain foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to product and other regulatory approvals.International business risks have in the past and may in the future negatively affect our business and financial statements.For example, in 2020 we generated approximately 12% of our sales from China. Accordingly, our business and financial statements can be adversely influenced by political, economic, legal, compliance and social conditions in China generally. Additionally, China’s government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies, and it maintains control over China’s economic growth through setting monetary policy and determining treatment of particular industries or companies. Further, considerable uncertainty exists regarding the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world’s leading economies, including the United States and China. Uncertainty or adverse changes to economic conditions in China or the policies of China’s government or its laws and regulations can have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China and can adversely affect our business and financial statements.In addition, our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and epidemics, such as COVID-19, which could adversely impact our supply chains and distribution systems, reduce demand for our products and services, and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial statements. Our growth can suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve, and visibility into our markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our business and financial statements. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies, and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities. Demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, marketing or promotional programs, new product introductions, the timing of industry trade shows and changes in distributor or customer inventory levels due to distributor or customer management thereof or other factors. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business and financial statements in any given period.Certain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other third-parties for development, supply and marketing of certain products, potential products and technologies, and such collaborative partners or other third-parties could fail to perform sufficiently.We believe that for certain of our businesses, success in penetrating target markets depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies. Relying on collaborative relationships is risky because, among other things, our collaborative partners may (1) not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations; (2) fail to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner; (3) be acquired by other companies and terminate our collaborative partnership or become insolvent; (4) compete with us; (5) disagree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship; (6) have insufficient capital resources; and (7) decline to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms. Because these and other factors may be beyond our control, the development or commercialization of our products 20involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. If we or any of our collaborative partners terminate a collaborative arrangement, we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or we may need to cancel some development programs, which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Acquisitions, Divestitures and Investment RisksAny inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices, and to make appropriate investments that support our long-term strategy, could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price.Our ability to grow revenues, earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies, and to make appropriate investments that support our long-term strategy. We may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price. Promising acquisitions and investments are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including high valuations, competition among prospective buyers or investors, the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain applicable antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms. In addition, competition for acquisitions and investments has resulted and may result in higher purchase prices. Changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions and investments.Our acquisition of businesses, investments, joint ventures and other strategic relationships could negatively impact our business and financial statements.As part of our business strategy we acquire businesses, make investments and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course, and we also from time to time complete more significant transactions; refer to MD&A for additional details. For example, our acquisition of Cytiva in March 2020 is Danaher’s largest acquisition to date based on purchase price. Acquisitions (including the acquisition of Cytiva), investments, joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges, including but not limited to the following, any of which could adversely affect our business and our financial statements:•businesses, technologies, services and products that we acquire or invest in sometimes under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid, fail to perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable or fail to achieve and/or sustain profitability;•we from time to time incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships, which can also cause a deterioration of Danaher’s credit ratings, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense and diminish our future access to the capital markets;•acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships can cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations in any given period, or over the long-term;•pre-closing and post-closing earnings charges can adversely impact our results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period-to-period;•acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships can create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address;•we can experience difficulty in integrating cultures, personnel, operations and financial and other controls and systems and retaining key employees and customers;•we may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition, investment, joint venture or strategic relationship;•we have assumed and may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company’s or investee’s activities and the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies can increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations;•in connection with acquisitions and joint ventures, we often enter into post-closing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments, earn-out obligations and indemnification obligations, which can have unpredictable financial results;21•as a result of our acquisitions and investments, we have recorded significant goodwill and other assets on our balance sheet and if we are not able to realize the value of these assets, or if the value of our investments declines, we are required to incur impairment charges;•we may have interests that diverge from those of our joint venture partners or other strategic partners or the companies we invest in, and we may not be able to direct or influence the management and operations of the joint venture, other strategic relationship or investee in the manner we believe is most appropriate, exposing us to additional risk; and•investing in or making loans to early-stage companies often entails a high degree of risk, and we do not always achieve the strategic, technological, financial or commercial benefits we anticipate; we may lose our investment or fail to recoup our loan; or our investment may be illiquid for a greater-than-expected period of time.The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the acquired company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our business and financial statements.Divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we or our predecessors have disposed could adversely affect our business and financial statements.We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest, spin-off, split-off or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. For example, in 2015, Danaher separated and split-off to Danaher shareholders the majority of its former communications business in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction with NetScout Systems, Inc. (the “Communications Disposition”), in 2016 Danaher separated and spun-off to Danaher shareholders its former Test & Measurement segment, Industrial Technologies segment (excluding the product identification businesses) and retail/commercial petroleum business (collectively known as Fortive Corporation) (the “Fortive Disposition”), and in 2019 Danaher consummated the separation and initial public offering (“IPO”) and subsequent split-off of its Dental segment, known as Envista Holdings Corporation (the “Envista Disposition”). Transactions such as these pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements. For example, when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not become satisfied. In addition, divestitures or other dispositions can dilute the Company’s earnings per share, have other adverse financial, tax and accounting impacts and distract management, and disputes can arise with buyers. In addition, we have retained responsibility for and/or have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we or our predecessors have sold or disposed. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our business or financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.Potential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the Communications Disposition, the Fortive Disposition or the Envista Disposition could materially and adversely affect our business and financial statements.With respect to each of the Communications Disposition, the Fortive Disposition and the Envista Disposition, we entered into a separation agreement and related agreements to govern the separation and related transactions and the relationship between the respective companies going forward. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party that can lead to disputes between us and the respective counterparty. If we are required to indemnify any of the other parties under the circumstances set forth in these agreements, we may be subject to substantial liabilities. In addition, with respect to the liabilities for which the other parties have agreed to indemnify us under these agreements, there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against such other parties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of the liabilities, or that such other parties will be able to fully satisfy their respective indemnification obligations. It is also possible that a court could disregard the allocation of assets and liabilities agreed to between Danaher and such other parties and require Danaher to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to such other parties. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business and financial statements.22We could incur significant liability if any of the Communications Disposition, the Fortive Disposition or the Envista Disposition is determined to be a taxable transaction.We have received opinions from outside tax counsel to the effect that each of the Communications Disposition, the Fortive Disposition and the Envista Disposition qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code. These opinions rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, our stockholders and we may not be able to rely on the respective opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) could determine on audit that any such transactions are taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the respective opinion. If any such transaction is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.Operational RisksA significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or data or violation of data privacy laws can adversely affect our business and financial statements.We rely on information technology systems, some of which are provided and/or managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers, other business partners and patients), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as receiving and fulfilling orders, billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations). In addition, some of our remote monitoring products and services incorporate software and information technology that house personal data and some products or software we sell to customers connect to our systems for maintenance or other purposes. These systems, products and services (including those we acquire through business acquisitions) can be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, human error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Attacks can also target hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. Security breaches of systems provided or enabled by us, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services, or security breaches of third party systems we rely on to process, store or transmit electronic information, can result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers, patients or suppliers. Like most multinational corporations, our information technology systems and data have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. Unauthorized tampering, adulteration or interference with our products may also adversely affect product functionality and result in loss of data, risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions. The attacks, breaches, misappropriations and other disruptions and damage described above can interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, result in disclosure of personally identifiable information, damage customer, patient, business partner and employee relationships and our reputation and result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, in each case resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial statements.In addition, our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving legal and regulatory standards, evolving customer expectations, changes in the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data and information systems, and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully maintain, enhance and upgrade our systems as necessary to effectively address these requirements. Further, a greater number of our employees are working remotely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental and community responses, which exposes us to greater cybersecurity risks.Any inability to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches can result in adverse regulatory consequences, business consequences and litigation. As a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. Please see “Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters” for additional information. Entities that are 23found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured patient health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by the HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EU member states may result in fines of up to €20 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties. Several other countries such as China and Russia have passed, and other countries are considering passing, laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. There is also a new, broad privacy law in California, the CCPA, which came into effect in January 2020. The CCPA has some of the same features as the GDPR, and has already prompted several other states to consider enacting similar laws. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, any of which may adversely affect our business and financial statements. In addition, compliance with the varying data privacy regulations across the United States and around the world has required significant expenditures and may require additional expenditures, and may require further changes in our products or business models that increase competition or reduce revenue.Defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products or services, or allegations thereof, can adversely affect our business and financial statements.Manufacturing or design defects or “bugs” in, unanticipated use of, safety or quality issues (or the perception of such issues) with respect to, “off label” use of, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell (including items that we source from third-parties) can lead to personal injury, death, and/or property damage and adversely affect our business and financial statements. These events can lead to recalls or safety alerts, result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us. Recalls, removals and product liability and similar claims (regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome) result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. Our business can also be affected by studies of the utilization, safety and efficacy of medical device products and components that are conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. Any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of product issues, including claims by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class.If we suffer loss to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed.Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, power shortage or outage, public health crisis (including epidemics and pandemics) and the reaction thereto, war, terrorism, riot or other natural or man-made disasters, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the damage caused to our facilities by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017. If any of these facilities, supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, diminish demand, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and significant repair or replacement expenses. The third-party insurance coverage that we maintain varies from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against such losses.The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products, our business and financial statements could suffer.The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems can arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or components, natural disasters and environmental factors, and if not discovered before the product is released to market can result in recalls and product liability exposure. Because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities and other stringent regulations of the FDA and similar agencies regarding the manufacture of certain of our products, an alternative manufacturer is not always available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity. Any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant adverse impacts to our business and financial statements.24If we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand, our business and financial statements may suffer. In addition, our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials, components and services can cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies.We purchase materials, components and equipment from third-parties for use in our manufacturing operations, including metallic-based components, electronic components, chemistries, OEM products, plastics and other petroleum-based products. Our profitability could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations, including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality. During a market upturn, suppliers from time to time extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices. If we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand, we may not be able to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed, our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities. Conversely, in order to secure supplies for the production of products, we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors, which can impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our business and financial statements may suffer.In addition, some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, regulatory requirements, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. If these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. The supply chains for our businesses can also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, war, terrorist actions, governmental actions (such as trade protectionism) and legislative or regulatory changes. Any of these factors can result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies.Because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, at times our manufacturing capacity exceeds or falls short of our production requirements. Any or all of these problems can result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial statements.Adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition, performance, purchasing patterns or inventory levels of, key distributors and other channel partners can adversely affect our business and financial statements.Certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to or through key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and end-users. Some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products or compete with us directly, and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. Adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners, reduction or discontinuation of their purchases from us or adverse developments in their financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns, can adversely affect our business and financial statements. The levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners, and changes in those levels, also impacts our results of operations in any given period. In addition, the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries can adversely impact our business and financial statements.Our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations.As discussed in “Item 1. Business—Materials,” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components, raw materials and other commodities. Prices for and availability of these components, raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past. Any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business and financial statements. In addition, due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve, the cost-containment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to, when commodity prices rise we are not always able to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions, or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs, our margins and profitability could decline and our business and financial statements could be adversely affected.Our restructuring actions can have long-term adverse effects on our business and financial statements.We have implemented significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. These restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities (including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses) reduce our available talent, assets and other resources and 25can slow improvements in our products and services, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers, limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases and trigger adverse public attention. In addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize from such actions. Moreover, we may not succeed in implementing present or future restructuring activities or cost reduction activities. Realizing the anticipated benefits from these initiatives, if any benefits are achieved at all, can take several years, and we may be unable to achieve our targeted cost efficiencies and profit margin improvements. Additionally, we may have insufficient access to capital to fund investments in these strategic initiatives, or our business strategy may change from time to time, which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business. Any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements.Work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations.Certain of our U.S. and non-U.S. employees are subject to collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our business and financial statements.Intellectual Property RisksIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third-parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights. These risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of intellectual property comparable to the United States.Many of the markets we serve are technology-driven, and as a result intellectual property rights play a significant role in product development and differentiation. We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our business. The intellectual property rights that we obtain, however, are not always sufficiently broad and do not always provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. In addition, the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property do not always prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented, designed-around or becoming subject to compulsory licensing. In some circumstances, enforcement is not available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third-parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights can adversely impact our business and financial statements.These risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of corporate proprietary information, intellectual property, technology and other assets comparable to the United States. The risks we encounter in such countries include but are not limited to the following:•Joint ventures that we participate in can include restrictions that could compromise our control over the intellectual property, technology and proprietary information of the joint venture;•As we expand our operations globally, increasing amounts of our data, intellectual property and technology is used and stored in countries outside the United States, and regulations in certain countries require data to be stored locally. These factors increase the risk that such data, intellectual property and technology could be stolen or otherwise compromised;•Certain of our products have been counterfeited and we may encounter additional and/or increased levels of counterfeiting in the future;•Governmental entities may adopt regulations or other requirements that give them rights to certain of our intellectual property, technology and/or proprietary information, such as through compulsory licensing or foreign ownership restrictions or requirements;26•In certain countries, we do not have the same ability to enforce intellectual property rights as we do in the United States; •Governmental regulations relating to state secrecy or other topics limit our ability to transfer data or technology out of certain jurisdictions; and•Risks, costs and challenges of operating in a particular jurisdiction can result in a decision to relocate or divert operations to a different jurisdiction, potentially at higher cost.Any of these risks can adversely impact our business and financial statements. Refer to “—International economic, political, legal, compliance, social and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements” for a discussion of additional risks relating to our international operations.Third-parties from time to time claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.From time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation of third parties’ intellectual property and cannot be certain that the conduct of our business does not and will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of others. Disputes or litigations regarding intellectual property can be costly and time-consuming to defend due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to critical technology, be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services, be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights, be required to license technology or other intellectual property rights from others, be required to cease marketing, manufacturing or using certain products or be required to redesign, re-engineer or re-brand our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our business and financial statements. Third-party intellectual property rights may also make it more difficult or expensive for us to meet market demand for particular product or design innovations. When we are required to seek licenses under patents or other intellectual property rights of others, we are not always able to acquire these licenses on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.The U.S. government has certain rights to use and disclose some of the intellectual property that we license and could exclusively license it to a third-party if we fail to achieve practical application of the intellectual property.Certain technology licensed by us under agreements with third-party licensors is subject to government rights. Government rights in inventions conceived or reduced to practice under a government-funded program can include a nonexclusive, royalty-free worldwide license to practice or have practiced such inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the U.S. government has the right to require us or our licensors (as applicable) to grant licenses which would be exclusive under any of such inventions to a third-party if they determine that: (1) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize such inventions in a particular field of use; (2) such action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (3) such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations. Further, the government rights include the right to use and disclose, without limitation, technical data relating to licensed technology that was developed in whole or in part at government expense.Financial and Tax RisksOur outstanding debt has increased significantly as a result of the Cytiva Acquisition, and we may incur additional debt in the future. Our existing and future indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and negatively impact our credit ratings; and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and financial statements.As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $21.2 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we had the ability to incur approximately $4.4 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under our credit facilities which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances. Our debt level and related debt service obligations (as well as the dividend obligations pursuant to our Series A and Series B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“MCPS”)) can have negative consequences, including (1) requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt (or dividends on our MCPS), which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and other investments; (2) reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and (3) exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates.27If our credit ratings are downgraded or put on watch for a potential downgrade, we may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in the amounts, at the times or interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if our current credit ratings were maintained.Our credit facilities and long-term debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us, including certain restrictions on our ability to incur liens on our assets, and a requirement under our credit facilities to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus shareholders’ equity) of 0.65 to 1.0 or less. If we breach any of these restrictions and cannot obtain a waiver from the lenders on favorable terms, subject to applicable cure periods, the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which would adversely affect our business and financial statements (including without limitation our liquidity). If we add new debt in the future, the risks described above would increase.We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.As of December 31, 2020, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $56.7 billion. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets, changes in the structure of our business, divestitures, market capitalization declines, or increases in associated discount rates can impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments adversely affect our financial statements in the periods recognized.Foreign currency exchange rates can adversely affect our financial statements.Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which can from time to time require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar adversely affects the cost of materials, products and services we purchase overseas. Sales and expenses of our non-U.S. businesses are also translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar generally results in unfavorable translation effects. In addition, certain of our businesses invoice customers in a currency other than the business’ functional currency, and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency can also result in unfavorable translation effects. The Company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries.Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments can affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities can result in additional tax payments for prior periods.We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was enacted. The TCJA significantly revised the U.S. federal corporate income tax law by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate to 21.0%, implementing a quasi-territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time tax on unremitted cumulative non-U.S. earnings of foreign subsidiaries (“Transition Tax”).Due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the TCJA), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our intercompany arrangements, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, our estimates of effective tax rate and income tax assets and liabilities can be incorrect and our financial statements could be adversely affected; please refer to MD&A for a discussion of additional factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period. The impact of the factors referenced in the preceding sentence may be substantially different from period-to-period.In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities, such as the audits described in MD&A and the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. If audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our results can include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements can be adversely affected. For example, the Danish tax authority’s assessments purporting to impose withholding tax relating to interest accrued in Denmark on historical borrowings from certain of the Company’s subsidiaries (further discussed in MD&A and the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements) could take many years to resolve and could ultimately result in a material, adverse impact to the Company’s financial statements, including its cash flows and effective tax rates. Any further significant changes to the tax system in the United States or in other jurisdictions (including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below) could also adversely affect our financial statements. Please see MD&A and the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the Company’s tax audits.28Changes in tax law relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect our tax position.The U.S. Congress, government agencies in non-U.S. jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) have focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting,” for which the OECD has released several components of its comprehensive plan that have been adopted and expanded by many taxing authorities to address perceived tax abuse and inconsistencies between tax jurisdictions. As a result, the tax laws in the United States and other countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Legal, political, and economic uncertainty surrounding the exit of the United Kingdom (“UK”) from the EU could have an adverse effect on our business and financial statements.The UK ceased to be a member state of the EU on January 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”), and the transition period provided for in the withdrawal agreement entered by the UK and the EU ended on December 31, 2020. In December 2020, the UK and the EU agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement that applies provisionally until it is ratified by the parties to the agreement. On December 31, 2020, the UK passed legislation giving effect to the trade and cooperation agreement, with the EU expected to formally adopt the agreement in the first half of 2021. The trade and cooperation agreement covers the general objectives and framework of the relationship between the UK and the EU, including with respect to trade, transport, visas, judicial matters, law enforcement and security matters, and provides for continued participation in community programs and mechanisms for dispute resolution. Uncertainties remain regarding the application of the terms of the trade and cooperation agreement and the other potential impacts of Brexit, such as the impact of new or different laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate (including potentially new or different regulations affecting clearance or approval of products that are developed or manufactured in the UK), and trade and tax impacts as the UK negotiates its own tax and trade treaties with countries around the world. The impacts from Brexit could add time and expense to the conduct of our business, delay regulatory approval of products, adversely impact the manufacturing or movement of products, adversely impact customer demand and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial statements. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had eight manufacturing facilities in the UK and the Company’s net investment in property, plant and equipment in the UK was $214 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, less than 5% of our sales were derived from customers located in the UK, however, the impact of Brexit could also impact our business and financial statements outside the UK.Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements.The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets, investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates can increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements. In addition, upward pressure on the cost of providing health care coverage to current employees and retirees can increase our future funding obligations and adversely affect our financial statements.Legal, Regulatory, Compliance and Reputational RisksSignificant developments or changes in U.S. laws or policies, including changes in U.S. trade policies and tariffs and the reaction of other countries thereto, particularly China, can have an adverse effect on our business and financial statements.Significant developments or changes in U.S. laws and policies (including as a result of the new U.S. administration), such as laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate, or governing the health care system and drug prices, can adversely affect our business and financial statements. For example, the previous U.S. administration increased tariffs on certain goods imported into the United States and trade tensions between the United States and China escalated, with each country imposing significant, additional tariffs on a wide range of goods imported from the other country. The U.S. and China could impose other types of restrictions such as limitations on government procurement or technology export restrictions, which could affect our access to markets. These factors have adversely affected, and in the future could further adversely affect, our business and financial statements.Our business and financial statements can be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems, including our Code of Conduct, always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, economic and trade sanctions, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the 29U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier code of conduct, and material violations of such code of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business and financial statements.Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements.In addition to the environmental, health, safety, health care, medical device, anticorruption, data privacy and other regulations noted elsewhere in this Annual Report, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional levels, including the following:•We are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons and dealings between our employees and between our subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory. In addition, we sell and provide products and technology to third parties, such as agents, representatives and distributors, who may export such items to end-users, and if any of these third parties do not comply with applicable export or import laws we may incur liability. In addition, from time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions. These business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures have prevented and will prevent violations of these regulations and any violation can adversely affect our business and financial statements.•We also have agreements to sell products and services to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with government entities (less than 5% of our 2020 sales were made to the U.S. federal government). The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. Our agreements with government entities are in some cases subject to termination, reduction or modification at the convenience of the government or in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors, and we may underestimate our costs of performing under the contract. In certain cases, a governmental entity may require us to pay back amounts it has paid to us. Government contracts that have been awarded to us following a bid process can become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder, which could result in loss of the contract. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts. These are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. The regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and can be inconsistent across jurisdictions. We, our representatives and the industries in which we operate are at times under review and/or investigation by regulatory authorities. Failure to comply (or any alleged or perceived failure to comply) with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations can result in import detentions, fines, damages, civil and administrative penalties, injunctions, consent decrees, suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts, disbarment from selling to certain governmental agencies or exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disruption of our business, limitation on our ability to manufacture, import, export and sell products and services, loss of customers, significant legal and investigatory fees, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, reputational harm, contractual damages, diminished profits, curtailment or restricting of business operations, criminal prosecution and other monetary and non-monetary penalties. Compliance with these and other regulations can also affect our returns on investment, require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our business. Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the International Standards Organization, and 30failure to comply with these rules can result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our business and financial statements. For additional information regarding these risks, refer to “Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters.”We are subject to or otherwise responsible for a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that can adversely affect our business and financial statements.We are subject to or otherwise responsible for a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business (or related to the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims or counterclaims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, breach of contract claims, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage, securities matters, fiduciary duties and acquisition or divestiture-related matters, as well as regulatory subpoenas, requests for information, investigations and enforcement. We also from time to time become subject to lawsuits as a result of acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, businesses divested by us or our predecessors. The types of claims made in lawsuits include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages (and in some cases, treble damages) and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits can divert our management’s attention, we from time to time incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we can be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that adversely affect our business and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, new developments (including litigation developments, the discovery of new facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases), changes in assumptions or changes in the Company’s strategy in any given period can require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments can adversely affect our business and financial statements in any particular period. We cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with current and future litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and business. However, based on our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2020 will have a material effect on our business or financial statements.From time to time, we become aware through our internal audits and other internal control procedures, employees or other parties of possible compliance matters, such as complaints or concerns relating to accounting, internal controls, financial reporting, auditing or ethical matters or relating to compliance with laws. When we become aware of such possible compliance matters, we investigate internally and take what we believe to be appropriate corrective action. Internal investigations can lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of legal or regulatory proceedings against us and adversely affect our business and financial statements.Certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. FDA and by comparable agencies of other countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information. Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the U.S. FDA, by other federal and state governmental agencies, by comparable agencies of other countries and regions, by certain accrediting bodies and by regulations governing hazardous materials and drugs-of abuse (or the manufacture and sale of products containing any such materials). The global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent and unpredictable. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years, and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, their existing regulations. Please see “Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters” for more information. Failure to meet these requirements adversely impacts our business and financial statements in the applicable geographies.To varying degrees, these regulators require us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution and post-marketing surveillance of our products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance (such as 510(k) clearance) or approvals for our new products or modifications to (or additional indications or uses of) existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be time-consuming, costly and subject to restrictions. Our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors, for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results, and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained. Even after initial regulatory clearance or approval, we are subject to periodic inspection by these regulatory authorities, and if safety issues arise we can be required to amend conditions for use of a product, such as 31providing additional warnings on the product’s label or narrowing its approved intended use, which could reduce the product’s market acceptance. We are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse, research and development, pricing and sales and marketing practices, the privacy and security of health information as well as manufacturing and quality standards, including the federal regulations described in “Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters.” Government authorities may conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law. Failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products (or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products), other violations of laws or regulations, failure to remediate inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products (even after obtaining clearance for distribution) and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to FDA Form 483 Inspectional Observations, warning letters, notices to customers, declining sales, loss of customers, loss of market share, remediation and increased compliance costs, recalls, seizures of adulterated or misbranded products, fines, expenses, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal penalties, consent decrees, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, narrowing of permitted uses for a product, refusal of the government to grant 510(k) clearance, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, pre-market notification rescissions and other adverse effects referenced under the risk factor titled “Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements.” Further, defending against any such actions can be costly and time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions brought against us, our business may be impaired. Ensuring that our internal operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations also involves substantial costs. Our products are subject to clinical trials, the results of which may be unexpected, or perceived as unfavorable by the market, and could adversely affect our business and financial statements.As a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for certain new products and new indications for certain existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unexpected or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials, or a regulator’s or the market’s perception of this clinical data, can adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate and our business and financial statements.Off-label marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties.The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about approved or cleared products. In particular, any clearances we may receive only permit us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the FDA. We may request additional label indications for our current products, and the FDA may deny those requests outright, require additional expensive performance or clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance. If the FDA or any other federal, state or foreign regulator determines that we have marketed our products for off-label use, we can be subject to exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the other adverse effects referenced under the risk factor titled “Certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. FDA and by comparable agencies of other countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information. Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements.” Any of these events could significantly harm our business and financial statements.Certain modifications to our products may require new 510(k) clearances or other marketing authorizations and may require us to recall or cease marketing our products.Once a medical device is permitted to be legally marketed in the United States pursuant to a 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer may be required to notify the FDA of certain modifications to the device (similar requirements apply in other jurisdictions). Manufacturers determine in the first instance whether a change to a product requires a new 510(k) clearance or premarket submission, but the FDA may review any manufacturer’s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances are necessary. We have made modifications to our products in the past and have determined based on our review of the applicable FDA regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 510(k) clearances or other premarket submissions were not required. We may make similar modifications or add additional features in the future that we believe do not require a new 510(k) clearance. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations and requires us to submit new 510(k) notifications, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance, and we may be subject to civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation.32Our operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our operations, products and services are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the health and safety of our employees, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials, emissions or discharges of substances into the environment, investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites, chemical constituents in products and end-of-life disposal and take-back programs for products sold. We cannot assure you that our environmental, health and safety compliance program (or the compliance programs of businesses we acquire) have been or will at all times be effective. Failure to comply with any of these laws can result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our business or financial statements.In addition, we from time to time incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury, property damage or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury or damage due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. We can also become subject to additional remedial, compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules. For additional information regarding these risks, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. We cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. However, based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2020 will have a material effect on our business or financial statements.Changes in governmental regulations can reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses.We compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional regulations, such as regulations governing health and safety, the environment, food and drugs, privacy and electronic communications. We develop, configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. Any significant change in any of these regulations (or in the interpretation or application thereof) can reduce demand for, increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services, or restrict our existing activities, products and services. For example, a number of our products and services are marketed to the pharmaceutical and related industries for use in discovering and developing drugs and therapies. Changes in the U.S. FDA’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process can have an adverse effect on the demand for these products and services. In addition, in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations. In these markets, the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations, the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address or the repeal of existing regulations, can adversely affect demand. In addition, regulatory deadlines can result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period-to-period.ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNot applicable.ITEM 2. PROPERTIESAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had facilities in over 60 countries, including approximately 239 significant administrative, sales, research and development, manufacturing and distribution facilities. 98 of these facilities are located in the United States in over 20 states and 141 are located outside the United States, primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia, South America, the rest of North America and Australia. Refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information with respect to the Company’s lease commitments.ITEM 3.

NOT APPLICABLE36Table of ContentsITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide material information relevant to an assessment of Danaher’s financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources. The MD&A is designed to focus specifically on material events and uncertainties known to management that are reasonably likely to cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or of future financial condition. This includes descriptions and amounts of matters that have had a material impact on reported operations, as well as matters that are reasonably likely based on management’s assessment to have a material impact on future operations. The Company’s MD&A is divided into five sections:•Overview•Results of Operations•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Critical Accounting Estimates•New Accounting StandardsThis discussion and analysis should be read together with Danaher’s audited financial statements and related Notes thereto as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 included in this Annual Report. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for 2018 is included in Item 7 of the Company’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and should be referred to for information regarding this period. Unless otherwise indicated, all financial results in this report refer to continuing operations.OVERVIEWGeneralRefer to “Item 1. Business—General” for a discussion of Danaher’s strategic objectives and methodologies for delivering long-term shareholder value. Danaher is a multinational business with global operations. During 2020, approximately 61% of Danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the United States. As a diversified, global business, Danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors. Danaher’s geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of its products, software and services, help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. The Company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.As a result of the Company’s geographic and industry diversity, the Company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges, including rapid technological development (particularly with respect to computing, automation, artificial intelligence, mobile connectivity, communications and digitization) in most of the Company’s served markets, the expansion and evolution of opportunities in high-growth markets, trends and costs associated with a global labor force, consolidation of the Company’s competitors and increasing regulation. The Company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and the Company’s long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in high-growth geographies and high-growth market segments, identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions and identify and consummate appropriate investments and strategic partnerships, develop innovative and differentiated new products and services with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of the Company’s sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated global environment. The Company is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions and investments, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources (particularly in high-growth markets) in order to be responsive to the Company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the Company’s operations.The COVID-19 PandemicThe global spread of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to unprecedented restrictions on, and disruptions in, business and personal activities, including as a result of preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses, our communities and governments have taken and are taking to mitigate the spread of the virus and to manage its impact. The Company continues to actively monitor the pandemic and has taken and intends to continue taking steps to identify and mitigate 37Table of Contentsthe adverse impacts on, and risks to, the Company’s business (including but not limited to its employees, customers, business partners, manufacturing capabilities and capacity, and supply and distribution channels) posed by the spread of COVID-19 and the governmental and community responses thereto. The Company’s businesses have activated their business continuity plans in response to the pandemic, including taking steps in an effort to help keep our workforce healthy and safe, and are assessing and updating those plans on an ongoing basis. As a result of COVID-19 the Company’s businesses have modified certain of their respective business practices (including in many cases with respect to employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and the Company expects to take such further actions as may be required by government authorities or as determined to be in the best interests of our employees, customers and other business partners. The Company has developed return-to-work protocols designed to help ensure the health and safety of its employees, customers and business partners, for its businesses to apply as and when return-to-work is legally permissible and deemed appropriate. We are also working with our suppliers to understand the existing and potential future negative impacts to our supply chain and take actions in an effort to mitigate such impacts. To date we have not experienced any significant supply chain disruptions. Given that the prevalence of COVID-19 and the nature of the response thereto (including the degree to which restrictions are being relaxed or re-imposed) varies significantly by geography, the impact of the pandemic on the Company’s different business locations around the world at any given time also varies significantly. We are also deploying our capabilities, expertise and scale to address the critical health needs related to COVID-19. We have developed and made available a diagnostic test for the rapid detection of COVID-19 and a diagnostic test that can detect antibodies in blood to confirm current or past exposure to COVID-19. In addition, our businesses, including the recently acquired Cytiva business (the Cytiva Acquisition is described below), are providing critical support to firms that are developing and producing vaccines for COVID-19, among other support. Cytiva, net of the product line divestitures required for regulatory approval of the acquisition, contributed approximately 1,800 basis points to the increase in the Company’s total sales in 2020 compared to 2019. We estimate that COVID-19 related demand contributed between approximately 700 to 750 basis points to the Company’s core sales growth including Cytiva in 2020 compared to 2019 (for the definition of “core sales including Cytiva,” refer to “—Results of Operations” below). As and to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic subsides we expect the demand for products and services related to COVID-19 will also subside. As further discussed below, while COVID-19 has positively impacted revenues for certain of our businesses, the pandemic and response thereto had a material negative impact on revenues and profitability in other of our businesses in 2020 and, while conditions overall improved sequentially from the second quarter through the end of 2020, the global demand for many of our products and services may remain depressed at least in the near-term if not longer. As noted below and subject to the assumptions discussed below, the Company expects core sales and core sales including Cytiva to grow in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the prior year. However, due to the speed with which the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, the global breadth of its spread, the range of governmental and community responses thereto and our geographic and business line diversity, its further impact on our business remains highly uncertain, but may be materially negative and will depend on future developments including but not limited to:•the duration of weaknesses in the macroeconomic environment and the timing and extent of recovery in the global demand for our products and services;•the pace at which medical providers resume patient care and testing that is not related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing of when research performed by laboratories and other institutions return to normal levels, and payment and funding dynamics related to the foregoing; and•the development and rate of adoption of the products we are offering to help address the pandemic and the effects thereof; competitive product launches and related pricing pressure; impacts from changes in the mix of our product offerings; and the degree to which COVID-19 testing solutions and vaccines are made available and utilized.For additional information on the risks of COVID-19 to the Company’s operations, refer to the “Item 1A—Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report. Business PerformanceConsolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased 24.5% as compared to 2019. Acquisitions, primarily Cytiva, contributed 18.0% to the increase in sales in 2020. While differences exist among the Company’s businesses, on an overall basis, demand for the Company’s products and services increased on a year-over-year basis in 2020 as compared to 2019. This demand, together with the Company’s continued investments in sales growth initiatives and the other business-specific factors discussed below, contributed to year-over-year core sales growth of 6.5% and core sales growth including Cytiva of 9.5% (for the definition of “core sales” refer to “—Results of Operations” below). From the date of Danaher’s acquisition of Cytiva on March 31, 2020 through December 31, 2020, Cytiva’s core sales grew more than 30% (compared to the comparable 2019 period when the Cytiva business was owned by General Electric Company (“GE”)) reflecting strength in 38Table of Contentsits served markets and its support in helping its customers develop and produce vaccines for COVID-19. Geographically, both high-growth and developed markets contributed to year-over-year core sales growth during 2020. Core sales in developed markets grew at a low-double digit rate in 2020 as compared to 2019 and were driven by North America and Western Europe. Core sales in high-growth markets grew at a mid-single digit rate in 2020 as compared to 2019 as growth in China and other high-growth markets in the second half of 2020 more than offset declines in China during the first quarter due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. High-growth markets represented approximately 30% of the Company’s total sales in 2020. The Company’s net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled approximately $3.6 billion, compared to approximately $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net earnings attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled approximately $3.5 billion or $4.89 per diluted common share compared to approximately $2.9 billion or $4.05 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net earnings in 2020 as compared to 2019 was driven by net earnings from increased sales in the Company’s existing businesses, net earnings from Cytiva, the 2020 gain on sale of product lines, and the provision for uncertain tax positions recorded in the first quarter of 2019 discussed below in “—Results of Operations—Income Taxes”, partially offset by the 2019 gain on the disposition of Envista Holdings Corporation. Refer to “—Results of Operations” for further discussion of the year-over-year changes in net earnings and diluted net earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2020. While the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on future periods is highly uncertain, the Company expects core sales and core sales including Cytiva to grow in the first quarter of 2021, assuming the negative impact of the pandemic does not increase in the United States and internationally. Demand for instruments and consumables related to COVID-19-related testing capabilities as well as supporting customers in pursuit of new COVID-19-related treatments and vaccines are expected to continue to drive growth in 2021 while the performance of the Company’s other businesses is expected to continue to improve. As discussed above, an increase of the COVID-19 infection rate and the re-imposition of government required restrictions could have a material negative impact on the Company’s financial statements.Acquisitions and DispositionsOn March 31, 2020, the Company acquired the Biopharma business of GE’s Life Sciences division, now known as Cytiva, for a cash purchase price of approximately $20.7 billion (net of approximately $0.1 billion of acquired cash) and the assumption of approximately $0.4 billion of pension liabilities (the “Cytiva Acquisition”). Cytiva is a leading provider of instruments, consumables and software that support the research, discovery, process development and manufacturing workflows of biopharmaceutical drugs. Cytiva is included in the Company’s Life Sciences segment results beginning in the second quarter of 2020. The acquisition has provided and is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Company’s Life Sciences segment by expanding the business’ geographic and product line diversity, including new product and service offerings that complement the Company’s current biologics workflow solutions. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion regarding the Company’s acquisitions. Envista DispositionOn September 20, 2019, Envista Holdings Corporation (“Envista”), a Danaher subsidiary at the time, completed an underwritten IPO of 30.8 million shares of its common stock, (the “IPO”), which represented 19.4% of Envista’s outstanding shares at the time of the offering, at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. In connection with the completion of the IPO, through a series of equity and other transactions, the Company transferred its dental businesses to Envista (the “Separation”). On December 18, 2019, Danaher completed the disposition of its remaining 80.6% ownership of Envista common stock through a split-off exchange offer, which resulted in Danaher’s repurchase of 22.9 million shares of Danaher common stock in exchange for the remaining shares of Envista common stock held by Danaher (the “Split-Off”). The IPO, Separation and Split-Off are collectively referred to as the “Envista Disposition”. As a result, the Company recognized a gain on the disposition of $451 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 equal to the difference between the fair value of the Danaher common stock tendered in the exchange offer and the carrying value of Envista common stock. The accounting requirements for reporting Envista as a discontinued operation were met when the Split-Off was completed. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. UK’s referendum decision to exit the EU (“Brexit”)For a discussion of Brexit and certain risks and implications thereof for the Company, refer to “Item 1A—Risk Factors”.39Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSIn this report, references to the non-GAAP measures of core sales (also referred to as core revenues or sales/revenues from existing businesses) and core sales including Cytiva refer to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) but excluding:•sales from acquired businesses (as defined below, as applicable); and•the impact of currency translation.References to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales and operating profit, as applicable, attributable to divested product lines not considered discontinued operations prior to the first anniversary of the divestiture; provided that in calculating core sales including Cytiva, Cytiva’s sales (net of the sales of the Company product lines divested in 2020 to obtain regulatory approval to acquire Cytiva, or the “divested product lines”) (“Cytiva sales”) are excluded from the definition of sales attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between:•the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses (as defined above, as applicable)); and•the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses (as defined above, as applicable)) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period.As noted above, beginning with results for the second quarter of 2020, the Company also presents core sales on a basis that includes Cytiva sales. Prior to the acquisition of Cytiva, Danaher calculated core sales solely on a basis that excluded sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition. However, given Cytiva’s significant size and historical core sales growth rate, in each case compared to Danaher’s existing businesses, management believes it is appropriate to also present core sales on a basis that includes Cytiva sales. Management believes this presentation provides useful information to investors by demonstrating the impact Cytiva has on the Company’s current growth profile, rather than waiting to demonstrate such impact 12 months after the acquisition when Cytiva would normally have been included in Danaher’s core sales calculation. Danaher calculates period-to-period core sales growth including Cytiva by adding to the baseline period sales Cytiva’s historical sales from such period (when it was owned by GE), net of the sales of the divested product lines, and also adding the Cytiva sales to the current period.Core sales growth (and the related measure of core sales including Cytiva) should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in Danaher’s business and facilitating comparisons of Danaher’s revenue performance with its performance in prior and future periods and to Danaher’s peers. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures to measure the Company’s operating and financial performance, and uses core sales growth as one of the performance measures in the Company’s executive short-term cash incentive program. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from these measures because currency translation is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions (other than Cytiva sales, in the case of core sales growth including Cytiva) and divestiture-related items because the nature, size, timing and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period-to-period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.Throughout this discussion, references to sales growth or decline refer to the impact of both price and unit sales and references to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies resulting from the ongoing application of DBS.40Table of ContentsCore Sales Growth and Core Sales Growth Including Cytiva 2020 vs. 20192019 vs. 2018Total sales growth (GAAP)24.5 %5.0 %Impact of:Acquisitions/divestitures(18.0)%(1.0)%Currency exchange rates — %2.0 %Core sales growth (non-GAAP)6.5 %6.0 %Impact of Cytiva sales growth (net of divested product lines)3.0 %Core sales growth including Cytiva (non-GAAP)9.5 %2020 Compared to 2019Total sales increased 24.5% on a year-over-year basis in 2020 primarily as a result of an increase in sales from acquired businesses, net of divestitures, primarily due to the acquisition of Cytiva, as well as an increase in core sales resulting from the factors discussed below by segment. The impact of currency translation did not have a significant impact on reported sales on a year-over-year basis in 2020 as the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar in the first half of 2020 was offset by the favorable impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar in the second half of 2020. Operating Profit PerformanceOperating profit margins were 19.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 18.3% in 2019. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.2020 vs. 2019 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by: •Higher 2020 core sales volumes, lower overall spending levels for business travel and other business activities as a result of the pandemic and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continued productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2020 and 2019, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various new product development and sales, service and marketing growth investments - 170 basis points •The incremental accretive effect in 2020 of acquired businesses (including Cytiva), net of product line dispositions which did not qualify as discontinued operations - 125 basis points2020 vs. 2019 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:•Acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue, and incremental transaction costs deemed significant and integration preparation costs, in each case related to the acquisition of Cytiva - 215 basis points. The Company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant (generally relating to the Company’s larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for Danaher in a given period. •Impairment charges related to trade names in the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment incurred in the third quarter of 2020 - 5 basis points•Impairment charges related to a facility in the Diagnostics segment and a trade name and other intangible assets in the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment incurred in the first quarter of 2020 - 5 basis pointsBusiness SegmentsSales by business segment for the years ended December 31 are as follows ($ in millions): 202020192018Life Sciences$10,576 $6,951 $6,471 Diagnostics7,403 6,561 6,258 Environmental & Applied Solutions4,305 4,399 4,320 Total$22,284 $17,911 $17,049 For information regarding the Company’s sales by geographical region, refer to Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.41Table of ContentsLIFE SCIENCESThe Company’s Life Sciences segment offers a broad range of instruments and consumables that are primarily used by customers to study the basic building blocks of life, including genes, proteins, metabolites and cells, in order to understand the causes of disease, identify new therapies, and test and manufacture new drugs and vaccines.

During 2020, total sales in the segment increased 52.0% primarily as a result of increased sales from acquisitions, net of divestitures and increased core sales resulting from the factors discussed below. Currency exchange rates had a negligible impact on total sales in 2020 compared to 2019. During 2020, increased demand for instruments and consumables used for COVID-19 related applications in the bioprocessing end-market was partially offset by lower demand in certain non-COVID-19 applications as a result of the response to the pandemic. The Company saw lower demand for equipment late in the first quarter and in the second quarter as the COVID-19 pandemic spread around the world, academic research labs closed late in the first quarter of 2020 and customers deferred purchases of larger instruments. The Company saw the gradual reopening of certain research labs later in 2020 as the pandemic subsided, although the recurrence of the pandemic in certain geographies has required certain labs to remain closed or operate at a lower capacity. Core sales for filtration, separation and purification technologies increased across most major geographies on a year-over-year basis led by Western Europe, China and North America. Demand for filtration, separation and purification technologies was led by COVID-19 related demand in the biopharmaceutical end-market, partially offset by weaker demand in the fluid technology and asset protection and aerospace end-markets. Core sales of microscopy products decreased on a year-over-year basis across all major product lines, primarily due to lower demand in the medical, industrial, and life science research end-markets. Geographically, demand for microscopy products decreased across all major geographies and end-markets, as shutdown measures to curb COVID-19 reduced year-over-year demand for equipment in particular. Year-over-year core sales for flow cytometry and particle counting solutions increased in 2020 across all major geographies and most end-markets due to increased demand for genomic sample preparation consumables and automation products resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Core sales of the business’ broad range of mass spectrometers declined on a year-over-year basis due to lower demand in the clinical and pharmaceutical end-markets in the first half of the year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for mass spectrometer products improved sequentially throughout the second half of 2020. Geographically, the decrease in demand was led by North America, Western Europe and China. Core sales in the genomics consumables business increased across all major geographies and product lines, driven primarily by demand for primer and probe kits related to COVID-19 testing. 42Table of ContentsThe acquisition of Cytiva on March 31, 2020 has provided, and is expected to continue to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Company’s Life Sciences segment by expanding the business’ geographic and product line diversity, including new product and service offerings that complement the Company’s biologics workflow solutions. Due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the end of the first quarter, there are no results of operations for Cytiva included in the Life Sciences segment in the first quarter of 2020. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, Cytiva is included in the Life Sciences segment results. In the last nine months of 2020, Cytiva experienced significant increased demand across all major geographies and end-markets, driven by demand for instruments and consumables used in the research and development of COVID-19-related treatments and vaccines.Operating Profit PerformanceOperating profit margins declined 80 basis points during 2020 as compared to 2019. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.2020 vs. 2019 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:•Higher 2020 core sales volumes, lower overall spending levels for business travel and other business activities as a result of the pandemic, incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continued productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2020 and 2019 and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates in 2020, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various new product development and sales and marketing growth investments - 200 basis points•The incremental accretive effect in 2020 of acquired businesses, net of product line dispositions which did not qualify as discontinued operations - 200 basis points2020 vs. 2019 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:•Acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue related to the acquisition of Cytiva - 480 basis pointsDepreciation and amortization increased during 2020 as compared to 2019 due primarily to the impact of the acquisition of Cytiva.DIAGNOSTICSThe Company’s Diagnostics segment offers analytical instruments, reagents, consumables, software and services that hospitals, physicians’ offices, reference laboratories and other critical care settings use to diagnose disease and make treatment decisions.

During 2020, total sales in the segment increased 13.0%, driven by the factors discussed below related to core sales growth, net of a modest negative impact from currency exchange rates. During 2020, increased demand for molecular diagnostics and acute care instruments and consumables to support the response to the COVID-19 pandemic was partially offset by lower demand for instruments and consumables in the clinical lab businesses as a result of shutdowns and restrictions related to the pandemic. While patient volumes remained down year-over-year, the Company saw sequential improvement in patient volume from the second quarter of 2020 through the end of the year. Core sales in the segment’s clinical lab business decreased on a year-over-year basis driven by lower demand across all major product lines. Geographically, shutdown measures to curb COVID-19 reduced core laboratory testing volumes year-over-year across all major geographies. Core sales increased in the molecular diagnostics business on a year-over-year basis in both developed and high-growth markets and contributed significantly to overall segment core sales growth. The molecular diagnostics business experienced particularly strong growth in sales of instruments and consumables in the infectious disease product line driven by the development and commercialization of diagnostic test solutions for COVID-19. Core sales in the acute care diagnostic business increased year-over-year primarily due to higher demand for blood gas instruments and consumables, driven in part by increased hospitalizations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Geographically, demand was strong across all major geographies. Core sales in the pathology business grew year-over-year driven by increased demand for advanced staining consumables and pathology imaging products. Geographically, core sales growth in the pathology business was led by North America and Western Europe, partially offset by soft demand in China. Operating Profit PerformanceOperating profit margins increased 350 basis points during 2020 as compared to 2019. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.2020 vs. 2019 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:•Higher 2020 core sales volumes, lower overall spending levels for business travel and other business activities as a result of the pandemic and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continued productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2020 and 2019, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various new product development and sales and marketing growth investments and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates in 2020 - 355 basis points2020 vs. 2019 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:•Impairment charges related to a facility incurred in the first quarter of 2020 - 5 basis pointsDepreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales decreased during 2020 as compared with 2019 largely due to the impact of increased sales in 2020.ENVIRONMENTAL & APPLIED SOLUTIONSThe Company’s Environmental & Applied Solutions segment offers products and services that help protect important resources and keep global food and water supplies safe. The Company’s water quality business provides instrumentation, consumables, software, services and disinfection systems to help analyze, treat and manage the quality of ultra-pure, potable, industrial, waste, ground, source and ocean water in residential, commercial, municipal, industrial and natural resource applications. The Company’s product identification business provides instruments, software, services and consumables for various color and appearance management, packaging design and quality management, packaging converting, printing, marking, coding and traceability applications for consumer, pharmaceutical and industrial products. 44Table of ContentsEnvironmental & Applied Solutions Selected Financial Data Year Ended December 31($ in millions)202020192018Sales$4,305 $4,399 $4,320 Operating profit979 1,052 988 Depreciation47 49 47 Amortization of intangible assets63 62 62 Operating profit as a % of sales22.7 %23.9 %22.9 %Depreciation as a % of sales1.1 %1.1 %1.1 %Amortization as a % of sales1.5 %1.4 %1.4 %Core Sales (Decline) Growth 2020 vs. 20192019 vs. 2018Total sales (decline) growth (GAAP)(2.0)%2.0 %Impact of:Acquisitions/divestitures— %(0.5)%Currency exchange rates 0.5 %2.0 %Core sales (decline) growth (non-GAAP)(1.5)%3.5 %2020 Compared to 2019 Price increases in the segment contributed 1.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2020 as compared with 2019 and are reflected as a component of the change in core revenue growth.During 2020, total sales in the segment decreased 2.0% primarily as a result of the factors discussed below related to core sales declines, as well as from the negative impact of currency exchange rates. Core sales in the segment’s water quality businesses increased slightly during 2020 as compared with 2019 as increased demand for consumables was mostly offset by lower over-year demand for equipment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While demand for equipment decreased on a year-over-year basis in 2020, the Company saw sequential improvement in the demand for equipment from the second quarter of 2020 through the end of the year. Year-over-year core sales in the analytical instrumentation product line increased in 2020, as increases in Western Europe and China more than offset decreases in North America and the Middle East. In the business’ chemical treatment solutions product line, increased demand in the food and beverage, commercial and industrial, and power end-markets was offset by lower demand in the oil and gas, primary metals, transportation and chemical end-markets. Geographically, year-over-year core sales in the chemical treatment solutions product line increased in North America and decreased in Latin America. Core sales in the business’ ultraviolet water disinfection product line increased in 2020, as increased demand in North America and Western Europe more than offset weaker demand in the high-growth markets. Core sales in the segment’s product identification businesses decreased at a mid-single digit rate during 2020 as compared with 2019 driven by lower demand for equipment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While demand for equipment decreased on a year-over-year basis in 2020, the Company saw sequential improvement in the demand for equipment from the second quarter of 2020 through the end of the year. Core sales in the marking and coding business decreased year-over-year, as increased demand in North America was more than offset by weaker demand in Western Europe and the high-growth markets. Demand for marking and coding equipment decreased in 2020, offsetting increased demand for consumables in the food and beverage, consumer-packaged goods and pharmaceutical end-markets. For packaging and color solutions products and services, core sales decreased year-over-year, driven by lower demand for equipment in North America, Western Europe and the high-growth markets. The Company saw continued improvement in demand for packaging and color management solutions in the second half of 2020 compared to the first half of the year. Operating Profit PerformanceOperating profit margins declined 120 basis points during 2020 as compared to 2019. Year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:•Lower 2020 core sales volumes and incremental year-over-year costs associated with sales, service and marketing growth investments, net of lower overall spending levels for business travel and other business activities as a result of the pandemic, incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continued productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2020 and 2019 and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates in 2020 - 65 basis points45Table of Contents•Impairment charges related to trade names incurred in the third quarter of 2020 - 35 basis points•Impairment charges related to a trade name and other intangible assets incurred in the first quarter of 2020 - 5 basis points•The incremental net dilutive effect in 2020 of acquired businesses - 15 basis pointsCOST OF SALES AND GROSS PROFIT Year Ended December 31($ in millions)202020192018Sales$22,284 $17,911 $17,049 Cost of sales(9,809)(7,927)(7,544)Gross profit$12,475 $9,984 $9,505 Gross profit margin56.0 %55.7 %55.8 %The year-over-year increase in cost of sales during 2020 as compared with 2019 was due primarily to the impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, including sales volumes from recently acquired businesses, and 2020 acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to inventory in connection with the Cytiva Acquisition, which increased cost of sales by $457 million in 2020.The year-over-year increase in gross profit margin during 2020 as compared with 2019 was due primarily to higher year-over-year sales volumes, including sales volumes from recently acquired businesses, and higher gross profit margins of recently acquired businesses, partially offset by the impact of 2020 acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue in connection with the Cytiva Acquisition, which adversely impacted gross profit margin comparisons by approximately 215 basis points in 2020 compared to 2019.OPERATING EXPENSES Year Ended December 31($ in millions)202020192018Sales$22,284 $17,911 $17,049 Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses(6,896)(5,589)(5,391)Research and development (“R&D”) expenses(1,348)(1,126)(1,059)SG&A as a % of sales30.9 %31.2 %31.6 %R&D as a % of sales6.0 %6.3 %6.2 %SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales declined 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2020 compared with 2019. The decline was driven by the benefit of increased leverage of the Company’s general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2020 sales volumes, including sales volumes from recently acquired companies, incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2020 and 2019, lower travel expenses in 2020 and lower year-over-year transaction costs related to the Cytiva Acquisition. These decreases were partially offset by incremental year-over-year amortization charges which adversely impacted SG&A as a percentage of sales by approximately 160 basis points, primarily related to the Cytiva Acquisition in 2020, as well as impairment charges related to a facility in the Diagnostics segment and trade name and other intangible assets in the Environmental & Applied solutions segment incurred in the first and third quarters of 2020 and continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives. R&D expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) as a percentage of sales declined in 2020 as compared with 2019, primarily due to lower R&D expenses as a percentage of sales in businesses recently acquired as well as the impact of sales growth rates in 2020 exceeding the spending growth related to the Company's new product development initiatives. 46Table of ContentsNONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) The Company disaggregates the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs of noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans and presents the other components of net periodic benefit cost in other (expense) income, net. These other components include the assumed rate of return on plan assets, partially offset by amortization of actuarial losses and interest and aggregated to a gain of $16 million, $12 million and $35 million as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company’s net periodic pension cost for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes a settlement loss of $7 million ($6 million after tax or $0.01 per diluted common share) as a result of the transfer of a portion of its non-U.S. pension liabilities related to one defined benefit plan to a third party.The Company estimates the fair value of investments in equity securities using the Fair Value Alternative and records adjustments to fair value within net earnings. Additionally, the Company is a limited partner in a partnership that invests in early stage companies. While the partnership records these investments at fair value, the Company’s investment in the partnership is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded net realized and unrealized gains of $18 million related to changes in the fair value of these investments. In addition, the Company recorded other income of $5 million related to certain other transactions during 2020. These items are reflected in other income (expense), net in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. No significant realized or unrealized gains or losses were recorded in either 2019 or 2018 with respect to these investments. GAIN ON SALE OF PRODUCT LINESAs a condition to obtaining certain regulatory approvals for the closing of the Cytiva Acquisition, the Company was required to divest certain of its existing product lines in the Life Sciences segment that in the aggregate generated revenues of approximately $170 million in 2019. On April 30, 2020, the Company completed the sale of these product lines for a cash purchase price, net of cash transferred and transaction costs, of $826 million and recognized a pretax gain on sale of $455 million ($305 million after-tax or $0.42 per diluted common share) in the second quarter of 2020. The divestiture of these product lines did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results and therefore is not reported as a discontinued operation. LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF BORROWINGSIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company redeemed the €800 million aggregate principal amount of 1.7% senior unsecured notes due 2022 at a redemption price equal to the outstanding principal amount and a make-whole premium as specified in the applicable indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of these borrowings of $26 million ($20 million after-tax or $0.03 per diluted common share) related to the payment of make-whole premiums in connection with the redemption. The Company funded the redemption using available cash balances, including proceeds from the fourth quarter 2020 issuance of the 2.6% senior unsecured notes due 2050.In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company redeemed the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.4% senior unsecured notes due 2020 and the $375 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes due 2020 at a redemption price equal to the outstanding principal amount and a make-whole premium as specified in the applicable indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of these borrowings of $7 million ($5 million after-tax or $0.01 per diluted common share) related to the payment of make-whole premiums in connection with the redemption. The Company funded the redemption using a portion of the cash distribution it received in connection with the Envista Disposition.INTEREST COSTSInterest expense of $275 million for 2020 was $167 million higher than in 2019, due primarily to the impact of higher average debt balances as a result of the issuances of debt in 2019 and 2020 (primarily to fund the Cytiva Acquisition) and 2020 borrowings under the Company’s $5.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that expires on August 27, 2024, subject to a one-year extension option at the request of the Company with the consent of the lenders (the “Five-Year Facility”) and the Company’s $5.0 billion 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that was scheduled to expire on August 26, 2020 (the “Superseded 364-Day Facility”), prior to the subsequent repayment of such credit facility borrowings. Proceeds from these borrowings as well as available cash balances were used to fund the acquisition of Cytiva and for general corporate purposes. Interest income of $71 million for 2020 was $68 million lower than in 2019, due primarily to lower interest rates and lower average cash balances in 2020 due to the funding of the Cytiva Acquisition. In January 2019, the Company entered into approximately $1.9 billion of cross-currency swap derivative contracts on its U.S. dollar-denominated bonds to effectively convert the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bonds to obligations denominated in Danish kroner, Japanese yen, euro and Swiss franc and reduce the interest rate from the stated interest rates on the U.S. dollar-denominated debt to the interest rates of the swaps. In addition, in 2020, the Company entered into approximately $1.0 billion of cross-currency swap derivative contracts on its U.S. dollar-denominated bonds to effectively convert the Company’s U.S. 47Table of Contentsdollar-denominated bonds to obligations denominated in euro and reduce the interest rate from the stated interest rates on the U.S. dollar-denominated debt to the interest rates of the swaps. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $2.0 billion of the cross-currency swap derivative contracts remained outstanding. For a further description of the Company’s debt and cross-currency swap derivative contracts related to the debt as of December 31, 2020 refer to Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. INCOME TAXESGeneralIncome tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.The Company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as further discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws and regulations, such as the TCJA and legislative policy changes that may result from the OECD’s initiative on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting or the change in the U.S. administration. For a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, refer to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash and Cash Requirements” below.The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis. Based on these reviews, which take into account the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the other factors referenced in the prior paragraph, reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary. For a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.Year-Over-Year Changes in the Tax Provision and Effective Tax RateYear Ended December 31202020192018Effective tax rate from continuing operations18.9 %26.4 %18.8 %The Company’s effective tax rate for 2020 and 2019 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0%, due principally to the Company’s earnings outside the United States that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates different than the U.S. federal statutory rate. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company conducts business globally, and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. The non-U.S. countries in which the Company has a significant presence include China, Denmark, Germany, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Excluding these jurisdictions, the Company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements given the geographic dispersion of the Company’s taxable income. The Company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities. The IRS has completed substantially all of the examinations of the Company’s federal income tax returns through 2015 and is currently examining certain of the Company’s federal income tax returns for 2016 through 2018. In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and various other countries, states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2004 through 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, the IRS proposed significant adjustments to the Company’s taxable income for the years 2012 through 2015 with respect to the deferral of tax on certain premium income related to the Company’s self-insurance programs. For income tax purposes, the recognition of premium income has been deferred in accordance with U.S. tax laws related to insurance. The IRS challenged the deferral of premiums for certain types of the Company’s self-insurance policies. These proposed adjustments would have increased the Company’s taxable income over the 2012 through 2015 period by approximately $2.7 billion. In the third quarter of 2020, the Company settled the 2012 through 2015 audit period with the IRS, including the resolution of these proposed adjustments. The settlement was not material to the Company’s financial statements, including its cash flows and effective tax rate. As the settlement with the IRS was specific to the audit period, the settlement does not preclude the IRS from proposing similar adjustments to the Company’s self-insurance programs 48Table of Contentsin current or future audits. In connection with its examination of the Company’s federal income tax returns for 2016, 2017 and 2018, the IRS has requested additional information on the Company’s self-insurance programs. Due to the enactment of the TCJA in 2017 and the resulting reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate for years after 2017, the Company revalued its deferred tax liabilities related to the temporary differences associated with this deferred premium income from 35.0% to 21.0%. If the IRS proposes adjustments related to the Company’s self-insurance premiums with respect to years subsequent to 2015 and prior to adoption of the TCJA and the Company is unsuccessful in defending its position, any taxes owed to the IRS may be computed under the previous 35.0% statutory tax rate and the Company may be required to revalue the related deferred tax liabilities from 21.0% to 35.0%, which in addition to any interest due on the amounts assessed, would require a charge to future earnings. Management believes the positions the Company has taken in its U.S. tax returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws. Tax authorities in Denmark have raised significant issues related to interest accrued by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. On December 10, 2013, the Company received assessments from the Danish tax authority (“SKAT”) of approximately DKK 1.9 billion including interest through December 31, 2020 (approximately $309 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2020) imposing withholding tax relating to interest accrued in Denmark on borrowings from certain of the Company’s subsidiaries for the years 2004 through 2009. The Company appealed these assessments to the Danish National Tax Tribunal in 2014. The appeal is pending, awaiting the final outcome of other, preceding withholding tax cases that were appealed to the Danish courts and subsequently to the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”). In February 2019, the CJEU decided several of these cases and ruled that the exemption of interest payments from withholding taxes provided in the applicable EU directive should be denied where taxpayers use the directive for abusive or fraudulent purposes, and that it is up to the national courts to make this determination. This decision of the CJEU now awaits application by the Danish High Court in the other, preceding withholding tax cases. SKAT has maintained a similar position related to withholding tax on interest accrued in Denmark on borrowings from certain of the Company’s subsidiaries with respect to tax years 2010 through 2015. In 2019, the Company received aggregate assessments for these matters of approximately DKK 1.8 billion including interest through December 31, 2020 (approximately $302 million based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2020). The Company is appealing these assessments as well. Management believes the positions the Company has taken in Denmark are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and is vigorously defending its positions. The Company intends on pursuing this matter through the Danish High Court should the appeal to the Danish National Tax Tribunal be unsuccessful. The Company will continue to monitor decisions of both the Danish courts and the CJEU and evaluate the impact of these court rulings on the Company’s tax positions in Denmark. The ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, could take many years, and could result in a further material adverse impact to the Company’s financial statements, including its cash flow and effective tax rate.On June 24, 2020, SKAT issued a press release to announce that it has misapplied Denmark’s interest rules in some assessments concerning withholding tax and overcharged interest. Subsequent to year end, the Company received a notice from SKAT dated January 15, 2021 that includes a significant reduction in the interest amounts due related to the assessments discussed above. The Company is reviewing the notice and the revised interest calculations received from SKAT. The Company expects its 2021 effective tax rate to be approximately 20.5% which is higher than the 2020 rate due primarily to the geographic mix of earnings anticipated for 2021. Any future legislative changes in the United States and/or potential tax reform in other jurisdictions, could cause the Company’s effective tax rate to differ from this estimate. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to income taxes.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS As further discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, discontinued operations include the results of Envista which was disposed of during the fourth quarter of 2019. In 2019, earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, were $576 million and reflect the operating results of Envista prior to the Envista Disposition and a gain on the disposition of Envista of $451 million, net of certain costs associated with the Envista Disposition including costs related to establishing Envista as a stand-alone entity and legal, accounting and investment banking fees. COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEComprehensive income increased by approximately $3.6 billion in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to a gain on foreign currency translation adjustments in 2020 compared to a loss in 2019, higher net earnings and a decrease in the loss from cash flow hedge adjustments in 2020 compared to 2019, partially offset by an increase in losses from pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments in 2020 compared to 2019. The Company recorded a foreign currency translation gain of approximately $2.9 billion for 2020 compared to a translation loss of $75 million for 2019. The Company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit loss of $147 million for 2020 compared to a loss of $90 million for 2019. The 49Table of ContentsCompany recorded losses from cash flow hedge adjustments related to the Company’s cross-currency swap derivative contracts in 2020 of $72 million compared to losses of $113 million in 2019.FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENTThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices as well as credit risk, each of which could impact its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. The Company also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign exchange risks and interest rate risks. In addition, the Company’s broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its financial statements as a whole.Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. A change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts the fair value of the debt but not the Company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2020, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt (excluding the LYONs, which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt was primarily derived from the value of its underlying common stock) by approximately $2.0 billion.As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s variable-rate debt obligations consisted primarily of euro-based commercial paper borrowings (refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2020). As a result, the Company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term interest rates. As these shorter duration obligations mature, the Company may issue additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings, to the extent commercial paper markets are available. In 2020, the average annual interest rate associated with the Company’s outstanding commercial paper borrowings was approximately negative 6 basis points. A hypothetical increase of this average to positive 13 basis points would have increased the Company’s annual interest expense by $5 million. The hypothetical increase used is the actual amount by which the Company’s commercial paper interest rates fluctuated during 2020.Refer to “Results of Operations—Interest Costs” for discussion of the Company’s cross-currency swap derivative contracts and interest rate swap agreements.Currency Exchange Rate RiskThe Company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than Danaher’s functional currency or the functional currency of its applicable subsidiary. The Company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign operations into U.S. dollars, Danaher’s functional currency. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the Company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of stockholders’ equity. Currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on 2020 reported sales on a year-over-year basis. If the currency exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2020 were to prevail throughout 2021, currency exchange rates would increase 2021 estimated sales relative to 2020 sales by approximately 3.0%. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies compared to the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2020 would adversely impact the Company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis. Any weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies compared to the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2020 would positively impact the Company’s sales and results of operations.The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this transactional exchange risk, although the Company has used foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps to hedge a portion of its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales and net earnings in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, the Company has assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies. A 10% depreciation in major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 50Table of Contents2020 would have reduced foreign currency-denominated net assets and stockholders’ equity by approximately $1.5 billion. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $2.0 billion of cross-currency swap derivative contracts outstanding as hedges of its net investment in foreign operations. These contracts effectively convert the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated bonds to obligations denominated in Danish kroner, Japanese yen, euro and Swiss franc, and partially offset the impact of changes in currency rates on foreign currency-denominated net assets during the term of the swap. The Company also uses cross-currency swap derivative contracts to hedge U.S. dollar-denominated long-term debt issuances in a foreign subsidiary whose functional currency is the euro against adverse movements in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro. For a further description of the Company’s cross-currency swap derivative contracts as of December 31, 2020 refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Equity Price RiskThe Company’s investment portfolio from time to time includes publicly-traded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price, though as of December 31, 2020, the Company held no available-for-sale marketable equity securities. The Company holds non-marketable equity investments in privately held companies that may be impacted by equity price risks. These non-marketable equity investments are accounted for under the Fair Value Alternative method with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. Volatility in the equity markets or other fair value considerations could affect the value of these investments and require charges or gains to be recognized in earnings. Commodity Price RiskFor a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”Credit RiskThe Company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, receivables from customers and derivatives. The Company places cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the Company’s customers. The Company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as deemed appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when deemed appropriate.The Company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and typically with high-quality financial institutions, so that exposure at any one institution is limited.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESManagement assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses, consummating strategic acquisitions and investments, paying interest and servicing debt, funding restructuring activities and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis.Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company continues to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s liquidity and capital resources and has taken actions intended to mitigate adverse impacts. Historically, the Company has generally relied on borrowings under its commercial paper program to address liquidity requirements that exceed the capacity provided by its operating cash flows and cash on hand, while also accessing the capital markets from time to time to secure financing for more significant acquisitions. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the availability of new borrowings in the commercial paper markets at times during 2020. Therefore, in the first half of 2020, the Company engaged in the following financing transactions:•The Company borrowed $2.5 billion under the Five-Year Facility and $2.5 billion under the Superseded 364-Day Facility for general corporate purposes (including payment of a portion of the purchase price for the Cytiva Acquisition and repayment of certain commercial paper obligations as they matured). The Company replaced the Superseded 364-Day Facility with a new $2.5 billion 364-Day Facility, which was terminated on December 31, 2020. All amounts borrowed under the credit facilities referenced above were repaid in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, 51Table of Contentsafter taking into account amounts backstopping outstanding commercial paper, the Company had availability under the Five-Year Credit Facility of approximately $4.4 billion for direct borrowings or to backstop the issuance of additional commercial paper to the extent available. •The Company issued approximately €2.5 billion (approximately $2.7 billion based on currency exchange rates as of the respective dates of the pricing of the notes) aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior unsecured notes, the proceeds of which have been and are being used for general corporate purposes (including repayment of the borrowings under the Superseded 364-Day Facility and the Five-Year Facility, and repayment of certain commercial paper obligations as they mature). •The Company completed the 2020 Common Stock Offering and 2020 MCPS Offering and received net proceeds of approximately $1.73 billion and $1.67 billion, respectively, which have been and will be used for general corporate purposes. •In October 2020, the Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of U.S. dollar-denominated senior unsecured notes, the proceeds of which have been and will be used for general corporate purposes, including the redemption of the 2022 Euronotes in the fourth quarter of 2020.Following is an overview of the Company’s cash flows and liquidity for the years ended December 31:Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity($ in millions)202020192018Total operating cash flows provided by continuing operations$6,215 $3,657 $3,644 Cash paid for acquisitions$(20,971)$(331)$(2,173)Payments for additions to property, plant and equipment(791)(636)(584)Proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment2 13 6 Payments for purchases of investments(342)(241)(146)Proceeds from sales of investments13 — 22 Proceeds from sale of product lines826 — — All other investing activities24 29 1 Total investing cash used in discontinued operations— (72)(75)Net cash used in investing activities$(21,239)$(1,238)$(2,949)Proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with stock-based compensation$153 $130 $96 Proceeds from the public offering of common stock, net of issuance costs1,729 1,443 — Proceeds from the public offering of preferred stock, net of issuance costs1,668 1,600 — Net proceeds from the sale of Envista Holdings Corporation common stock, net of issuance costs— 643 — Payment of dividends(615)(527)(433)Net (repayments of) proceeds from borrowings (maturities of 90 days or less)(4,637)2,802 66 Proceeds from borrowings (maturities longer than 90 days)8,670 12,113 — Repayments of borrowings (maturities longer than 90 days)(5,933)(1,565)(508)Make-whole premiums to redeem borrowings prior to maturity(26)(7)— All other financing activities(3)(43)(18)Cash distributions to Envista Holdings Corporation, net— (224)— Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$1,006 $16,365 $(797)•Operating cash flows from continuing operations increased approximately $2.6 billion, or approximately 70%, during 2020 as compared to 2019, due to higher net earnings (and excluding noncash impairment charges and fair value adjustments related to certain long-lived assets in 2020, noncash charges for depreciation, amortization and stock compensation in both periods, and noncash discrete tax charges in 2019), higher cash provided by trade accounts payable, prepaid expenses and other assets, and accrued expenses and other liabilities during the 2020 period 52Table of Contentscompared to the prior year, partially offset by higher cash used for trade accounts receivable and inventories in 2020 compared to the prior year. •Net cash used in investing activities increased approximately $20.0 billion during 2020 as compared to 2019 and consisted primarily of cash paid for acquisitions, primarily the Cytiva Acquisition, and to a lesser extent investments. Refer to Notes 3 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for a discussion of the Company’s acquisitions and investments. •Refer to the discussion at the beginning of the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section for a summary of the Company’s 2020 financing activities.•As of December 31, 2020, the Company held approximately $6.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents.Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities and productivity improvement initiatives, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows.Operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $6.2 billion for 2020, an increase of approximately $2.6 billion, or approximately 70%, as compared to 2019. The year-over-year change in operating cash flows from 2019 to 2020 was primarily attributable to the following factors:•2020 operating cash flows benefited from higher net earnings in 2020 as compared to 2019. Partially offsetting the impact of this increase is the fact that 2019 net earnings from continuing operations included $215 million of net discrete noncash tax charges compared to a net discrete noncash tax benefit of $85 million in 2020. In addition, net earnings from continuing operations in 2020 included $22 million of noncash impairment charges and $6 million of fair value adjustment gains related to certain long-lived assets and investments. These noncash charges and gains impacted earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows. •Net earnings for 2020 reflected an increase of approximately $1.1 billion of depreciation, amortization (intangible assets and inventory step-up) and stock compensation expense as compared to 2019. Amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments. Depreciation expense relates to both the Company’s manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operating-type lease arrangements. The increase in depreciation and amortization in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to the Cytiva Acquisition in 2020. Depreciation, amortization and stock compensation are noncash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows.•The aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable used $160 million in operating cash flows during 2020, compared to $161 million of operating cash flows used in 2019. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively the Company manages the cash conversion cycle, which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day it pays for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from its customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period.•The aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets, deferred income taxes and accrued expenses and other liabilities provided $765 million in operating cash flows during 2020, compared to $38 million provided in 2019. The timing of cash payments for taxes, various employee-related liabilities, customer funding and accrued expenses drove the majority of this change.Investing ActivitiesCash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures, including instruments leased to customers, cash used for investments and cash proceeds from divestitures of businesses or assets.Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $21.2 billion during 2020 compared to approximately $1.2 billion of net cash used in 2019.53Table of ContentsAcquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of InvestmentsFor a discussion of the Company’s 2020 acquisitions and divestitures refer to “—Overview” and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, in 2020 and 2019, the Company invested $342 million and $241 million, respectively, in non-marketable equity securities and partnerships. During 2019, the Company acquired five businesses for total consideration of $331 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company’s three segments. The aggregate annual sales of these businesses at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the companies’ revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $72 million. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company’s transfer of its former dental business to Envista Holdings Corporation. Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development, improving information technology systems and the manufacture of instruments that are used in operating-type lease arrangements that certain of the Company’s businesses enter into with customers. Capital expenditures totaled $791 million in 2020 and $636 million in 2019. The year-over-year increase in capital spending in 2020 was primarily due to capital expenditures to support production of products supporting customers’ efforts related to testing, treatment and vaccine production for COVID-19 and capital expenditures at Cytiva, partially offset by declines in expenditures for instruments used in OTL arrangements. In 2021, the Company expects to incur higher capital spending than the prior year, to primarily support production of products related to testing, treatment and vaccine production for COVID-19. The Company’s actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions, including demand for the Company’s products related to COVID-19, regulatory requirements, and the capability of suppliers to support increased production. As a result, the Company estimates capital expenditures in 2021 to be between approximately $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion.Financing ActivitiesCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, issuance and repurchases of common stock, issuance of preferred stock and payments of cash dividends to shareholders. Financing activities provided cash of approximately $1.0 billion during 2020 compared to approximately $16.4 billion of cash provided during 2019. The year-over-year decrease in cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to the significant borrowings incurred in 2019 to finance the Cytiva Acquisition, partially offset by borrowings incurred in 2020 to finance the remaining amounts needed to acquire Cytiva and for general corporate purposes. Total debt was approximately $21.2 billion and $21.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and notes payable and current portion of long-term debt was $11 million and $212 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 the Company had the ability to incur approximately $4.4 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under the Company’s $5.0 billion Five-Year Facility which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has classified $611 million of its borrowings outstanding under the euro-denominated commercial paper program and $290 million of borrowings outstanding under the 2021 Yen Notes as long-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company has the intent and ability, as supported by availability under the Five-Year Facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date. As commercial paper obligations mature, the Company may issue additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings, to the extent commercial paper markets are available. Under the Company’s U.S. and euro-denominated commercial paper program, the notes are typically issued at a discount from par, generally based on the ratings assigned to the Company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to LIBOR or EURIBOR. Additionally, the Company’s floating rate senior unsecured notes due 2022 pay interest based upon the three-month EURIBOR plus 0.3%. In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the intent to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. The Company has evaluated the anticipated impact of the transition from LIBOR and does not expect the transition to be material to the Company’s financial position. 54Table of ContentsRefer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company’s financing activities and indebtedness, including the Company’s outstanding debt as of December 31, 2020, and the Company’s commercial paper program and Five-Year Facility.Common Stock Offering and MCPS OfferingFor a description of the 2019 Common Stock and MCPS Series A Offerings and the 2020 Common Stock and MCPS Series B Offerings, refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Shelf Registration StatementThe Company has filed a “well-known seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance. The Company expects to use net proceeds realized by the Company from future securities sales off this shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, including without limitation repayment or refinancing of debt or other corporate obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends and/or working capital.Stock Repurchase ProgramPlease see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s stock repurchase program.DividendsThe Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share of Company common stock that was paid on January 29, 2021 to holders of record on December 28, 2020. In addition, the Company declared quarterly cash dividends of $11.875 per MCPS Series A and $12.50 per MCPS Series B that were paid on January 15, 2021 to holders of record as of December 31, 2020. Aggregate 2020 and 2019 cash payments for dividends on Company common stock were $500 million and $478 million, respectively, and aggregate 2020 and 2019 cash payments for the dividends on the Company’s MCPS were $115 million and $49 million, respectively. The year-over-year increase in dividend payments in 2020 primarily relates to dividends paid on the MCPS Series A and MCPS Series B, which were issued in March 2019 and May 2020, respectively, and an increase in the quarterly dividend rate on common stock effective with respect to the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2020.Cash and Cash RequirementsAs of December 31, 2020, the Company held approximately $6.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were on deposit with financial institutions or invested in highly liquid investment-grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an approximate weighted average annual interest rate of 0.2%. Of this amount, approximately $1.5 billion was held within the United States and approximately $4.5 billion was held outside of the United States. The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments, pay interest and service debt, pay taxes and any related interest or penalties, fund its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock as applicable and support other business needs. The Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, particularly in connection with acquisitions, the Company may also borrow under its commercial paper programs or Five-Year Facility, enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program and/or issue debt and/or equity in the capital markets, in each case to the extent such sources of capital remain available. The Company also may from time to time access the capital markets to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions. While repatriation of some cash held outside the United States may be restricted by local laws, most of the Company’s foreign cash could be repatriated to the United States. Following enactment of the TCJA and the associated Transition Tax, in general, repatriation of cash to the United States can be completed with no incremental U.S. tax; however, repatriation of cash could subject the Company to non-U.S. jurisdictional taxes on distributions. The cash that the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations, investments and acquisitions. The income taxes applicable to repatriating such earnings are not readily determinable. As of December 31, 2020, principally all of the Company’s non-U.S. earnings are indefinitely reinvested and management believes that the Company has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs, including its cash needs in the United States.During 2020, the Company contributed $140 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans and $51 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2021, the Company’s cash contribution requirements for its U.S. and its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately $10 million and $44 million, respectively. The ultimate 55Table of Contentsamounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan’s funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates and other factors.Contractual and Other ObligationsFor a description of the Company’s debt and lease obligations, commitments, and litigation and contingencies, refer to Notes 5, 11, 17, and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Legal ProceedingsRefer to “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies, and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESManagement’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience, the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments.The Company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period-to-period. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Acquired Intangibles—The Company’s business acquisitions, including the Cytiva Acquisition, typically result in the recognition of goodwill, developed technology and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the Company may incur. The fair values of acquired intangibles are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by the Company. Significant assumptions include the discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results of the acquired business including revenue, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), growth rates, royalty rates and technology obsolescence rates. These assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. The Company engages third-party valuation specialists who review the Company’s critical assumptions and calculations of the fair value of acquired intangible assets in connection with significant acquisitions. In connection with acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized aggregate goodwill of approximately $10.4 billion and intangible assets of approximately $10.7 billion. Refer to Notes 1, 3 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s policies relating to goodwill, acquired intangibles and acquisitions.In performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market-based approach which relies on current trading multiples of forecasted EBITDA for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the Company’s reporting units to calculate an estimated fair value of each reporting unit. In evaluating the estimates derived by the market-based approach, management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had five reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment. Management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units generally decreases as these businesses are integrated into the Company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2020 indicated that in all instances, the fair values of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 80% to approximately 695%. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment 56Table of Contentstest, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this hypothetical 10% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 60% to approximately 615%.The Company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred for finite-lived intangibles requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. These analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues, expenses, market conditions and discount rates related to these assets. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of intangible assets impairment charges recorded during 2020.If actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the Company’s financial statements. Historically, the Company’s estimates of goodwill and intangible assets have been materially correct.Contingent Liabilities—As discussed in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). The Company recognizes a liability for any legal contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors, including those discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If the reserves established by the Company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s financial statements.Revenue Recognition—The Company derives revenues from the sale of products and services. Revenue is recognized when control over the promised products or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In determining if control has transferred, the Company considers whether certain indicators of the transfer of control are present, such as the transfer of title, present right to payment, significant risks and rewards of ownership and customer acceptance when acceptance is not a formality. To determine the consideration that the customer owes the Company, the Company must make judgments regarding the amount of customer allowances and rebates, as well as an estimate for product returns. The Company also enters into lease arrangements with customers which requires the Company to determine whether the arrangements are operating or sales-type leases. Refer to Notes 1 and 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s revenue recognition policies.If the Company’s judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect, the Company’s reported revenues in particular periods may be incorrect. Historically, the Company’s estimates of revenue have been materially correct.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits—For a description of the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit accounting practices, refer to Notes 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations, including assumptions regarding discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rates of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates and other factors. If the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change (as a result of differences in actual experience, changes in key economic indicators or other factors) the Company’s financial statements could be materially affected. A 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the U.S. net obligation by $144 million ($110 million on an after-tax basis) and the non-U.S. net obligation by $191 million ($147 million on an after-tax basis) from the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020. A 50 basis point increase in the discount rates used for the plans would have decreased the U.S. net obligation by $133 million ($101 million on an after-tax basis) and the non-U.S. net obligation by $175 million ($135 million on an after-tax basis) from the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020.For 2020, the estimated long-term rate of return for the U.S. plans was 7.0%, and the Company intends to use an assumption of 6.75% for 2021. The estimated long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plans was determined on a plan-by-plan basis based on 57Table of Contentsthe nature of the plan assets and ranged from 0.5% to 5.0%. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2020 was reduced by 50 basis points, pension expense for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans for 2020 would have increased $9 million ($7 million on an after-tax basis) and $6 million ($4 million on an after-tax basis), respectively.For a discussion of the Company’s 2020 and anticipated 2021 defined benefit pension plan contributions, refer to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash and Cash Requirements”.Income Taxes—For a description of the Company’s income tax accounting policies, refer to Notes 1 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. This requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding: (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. Future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial statements. The Company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when, based upon the technical merits, it is “more likely than not” that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. Judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions. The Company re-evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances, including when: (1) a tax audit is completed; (2) applicable tax laws change, including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (3) the applicable statute of limitations expires.In addition, certain of the Company’s tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in Denmark and the United States (refer to “—Results of Operations—Income Taxes” and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws. However, the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in the Company being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact to the Company’s financial statements, including its effective tax rate.An increase of 1.0% in the Company’s 2020 nominal tax rate would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $45 million.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSFor a discussion of the new accounting standards impacting the Company, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.ITEM 7A.

313616,DHR,DANAHER CORP /DE/,2022,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) included in this Annual Report. For a discussion of risks related to the Company’s non-U.S. operations and foreign currency exchange, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”Available InformationThe Company maintains an internet website at www.danaher.com. The Company makes available free of charge on the website its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“the Exchange Act”), as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material with, or furnishing such material to, the SEC. Danaher’s internet site and the information contained on or connected to that site are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. We have identified the risks and uncertainties described below as material, but they are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, economic conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws, regulations or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns including pandemics, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business and financial statements, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, and our stock price.Business and Strategic RisksThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, certain elements of our business and our financial statements.Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19. The global spread of COVID-19 has led to unprecedented restrictions on, and disruptions in, business and personal activities, including as a result of preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses, our communities and governments are taking to mitigate the spread. For example, national, state and local governments have implemented and may continue to implement safety precautions, including quarantines, border closures, increased border controls, travel restrictions, shelter in place orders, shutdowns, government-ordered vaccine mandates and other measures. These measures can disrupt normal business operations and can have significant negative impacts on businesses and financial markets worldwide.The direct impact of COVID-19 and the preventive and precautionary measures implemented as a result thereof have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, certain elements of our Company (including to a different degree our operations, commercial organizations, supply chains and distribution systems). Please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of how COVID-19 impacted our results of operations and financial position in 2021. Without limiting the foregoing, we have experienced and/or may in the future experience:•constraints on the movement of our products through the supply chain;•capacity constraints and price increases in our own supply chain, including with respect to freight services;•adverse impacts on our workforce and/or key employees including labor availability;•adverse impacts on customer orders and purchases and unpredictable reductions in demand for our products;•adverse impacts on our collections of accounts receivable, including delays in collections and increases in uncollectible receivables;•unpredictable increases in demand for certain products; and•increased cybersecurity attack activity.While the pandemic continues we may experience continued adverse impacts on certain elements of our business and financial statements. Even to the extent COVID-19 conditions begin to improve, the duration and sustainability of any such improvements will be uncertain and continuing adverse impacts and/or the degree of improvement may vary dramatically by 16geography and line of business. The actions Danaher’s businesses take in response to any improvements in conditions may vary widely by geography and line of business and will likely be made with incomplete information; pose the risk that such actions may prove to be premature, incorrect or insufficient; and could have an adverse impact on our business and financial statements. Please see “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of the Company products that are being used in the fight against COVID-19. In an effort to optimize availability of needed medical and other supplies and products in connection with the pandemic, we may elect to or governments may require us or our customers to allocate manufacturing capacity (for example, pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act (“DPA”)) in a way that adversely affects our financial condition and results of operations, results in differential treatment of customers and/or adversely affects our reputation and customer relationships. For example, certain of our customers are or have been subject to DPA requirements relating to the production of COVID-19 related products and have required certain of our businesses to also comply with these requirements under our supply agreements. Please also see the risk factor titled “The U.S. government has certain rights with respect to incremental production capacity and/or the intellectual property we have developed using government financing” for a discussion of the U.S. government’s rights in connection with funding they have provided certain of our businesses to finance capacity expansion for the production of certain COVID-19 related products.In addition, the levels of demand for our COVID-19 related products can exceed our capacity to meet such demand on a timely basis or at all, which can result in negative publicity and future competitive disadvantage and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial statements. The accelerated development and production of products and services in an effort to address medical and other requirements as a result of the pandemic also increases the risk of regulatory enforcement actions, product defects or claims thereof. In addition, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic moderates, and/or if COVID-19 vaccination, therapeutic or testing practices change and Danaher’s offerings are no longer a preferred solution, demand for Danaher’s COVID-19 solutions may decline. Any of these developments may adversely affect our business and financial statements.Conditions in the global economy, the particular markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our business is sensitive to general economic conditions. Slower economic growth in the domestic and/or international markets, inflation, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt, volatility in the currency and credit markets, high levels of unemployment or underemployment, labor availability constraints, reduced levels of capital expenditures, changes or anticipation of potential changes in government trade, fiscal, tax and monetary policies, changes in capital requirements for financial institutions, government budget negotiation dynamics, sequestration, austerity measures and other challenges that affect the global economy have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, the Company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, including having the effect of:•reducing demand for our products and services (in this Annual Report, references to products and services also includes software), limiting the financing available to our customers and suppliers, increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies;•increasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories;•increasing price competition in our served markets; •supply interruptions or delays, which can disrupt our ability to produce or deliver our products; •increasing the risk of impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, and the risk that we may not be able to fully recover the value of other assets such as real estate and tax assets; •increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which, in addition to increasing the risks identified above, could result in preference actions against us; and•adversely impacting market sizes and growth rates.If growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period, if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve, our business and financial statements can be adversely affected.17We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share. Even if we compete effectively, we may be required to reduce the prices we charge.Our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. Because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors; refer to “Item 1. Business—Competition” for additional details. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets, including high-growth markets. Our ability to compete can also be impacted by changing customer preferences and requirements (for example increased demand for products incorporating digital capabilities or more environmentally-friendly products and supplier practices) as well as changes in the way healthcare services are delivered (including the movement of some care from acute to non-acute settings and increased focus on chronic disease management). Cost containment efforts by governments and the private sector, particularly in the healthcare industry, are also resulting in increased emphasis on products that reduce costs and improve efficiency and effectiveness. In addition, significant shifts in industry market share have occurred and may in the future occur in connection with product problems, safety alerts and publications about products, reflecting the competitive significance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems in our industry. Our failure to compete effectively and/or pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our business and financial statements, and our expansion into new markets may result in greater-than-expected risks, liabilities and expenses. In addition, the Company’s competitors and customers have from time to time introduced, and may in the future introduce, private label, generic or low-cost products that compete with the Company’s products at lower price points. Competitors’ products can capture significant market share or lead to a decrease in market prices overall, resulting in an adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial statements.Our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation.We generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis, our offerings will become obsolete over time and our business and financial statements will suffer. Our success depends on several factors, including our ability to:•correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;•allocate our R&D funding to products and services with higher growth prospects;•anticipate and respond to our competitors’ development of new products and services and technological innovations;•differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings and avoid commoditization;•innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets;•obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies before our competitors do;•successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time;•obtain necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope (including with respect to medical device products by demonstrating satisfactory clinical results where applicable as well as achieving third-party reimbursement); and•stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies.If we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in R&D of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our business and financial statements. Even when we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we often incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. In addition, promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, uncertainty over third-party reimbursement or entrenched patterns of clinical practice. Competitors may also develop after-market services and parts for our products which may detract from our sales.18The health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce (and increase the predictability of) costs, which can adversely affect our business and financial statements.The health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce (and increase the predictability of) costs, including the following:•Many of our customers, and the end-users to whom our customers supply products, rely on government funding of and reimbursement for healthcare products and services and research activities. The PPACA, health care austerity measures in other countries and other potential healthcare reform changes and government austerity measures have reduced and may further reduce the amount of government funding or reimbursement available to customers or end-users of our products and services and/or the volume of medical procedures using our products and services. For example, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“PAMA”), introduced a multi-year pricing program for services payable under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (“CLFS”) that is designed to bring Medicare allowable amounts in line with the amounts paid by private payers. It is still unclear whether and to what extent these new rates will affect overall pricing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing services, but to the extent our customers conclude that Medicare reimbursement for these services is inadequate, it can in turn adversely impact the prices at which we sell our products. Other countries, as well as some private payors, also control the price of health care products, directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing or coverage limitations, tying reimbursement to outcomes or (in the case of governmental entities) through compulsory licensing. Global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement.•Governmental and private health care providers and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the delivery of healthcare services, centralizing purchasing, limiting the number of vendors that may participate in purchasing programs, forming group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks and pursuing consolidation to improve their purchasing leverage and using competitive bid processes to procure healthcare products and services. Payors are also seeking to improve price predictability in an effort to mitigate exposure to future price increases.These changes as well as other impacts from market demand, government regulations, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures are changing the way healthcare is delivered, reimbursed and funded and have in the past and could in the future cause participants in the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services, reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products and services from governmental agencies or third-party payors, heighten clinical data requirements, reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services, affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products and increase our compliance and other costs. In addition, we may be excluded from important market segments or unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us, and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability. All of the factors described above can adversely affect our business and financial statements.International economic, political, legal, compliance, social and business factors can negatively affect our business and financial statements.In 2021 approximately 62% of our sales were derived from customers outside the U.S. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located outside the U.S. Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the U.S. and increase the localization of our products and services, we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the U.S., particularly in the high-growth markets. Our non-U.S. business (and particularly our business in high-growth markets) is subject to risks that include:•public health crises and epidemics, such as COVID-19;•interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers; •differences in terms of sale, including longer payment terms than are typical in the U.S.;•local product preferences or requirements;•changes in a country’s or region’s political, legal, social or economic conditions, such as the devaluation of particular currencies;•trade protection measures, tariffs, embargoes and import or export restrictions and requirements;19•unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws;•capital controls and limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash;•the potential for nationalization of enterprises;•changes in local healthcare delivery, payment and reimbursement policies and programs;•complex data privacy and cybersecurity requirements;•limitations on legal rights and our ability to enforce such rights, including differing protection of intellectual property;•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;•workforce instability and differing labor or employment regulations;•difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis; and•greater uncertainty, risk, expense and delay in commercializing products in certain foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to product and other regulatory approvals.International business risks have in the past and may in the future negatively affect our business and financial statements.For example, in 2021 we generated approximately 13% of our sales from China. Accordingly, our business and financial statements can be adversely influenced by political, economic, legal, compliance, social and business conditions in China generally. Additionally, China’s government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing sector-specific policies, and it maintains control over China’s economic growth through setting monetary policy and determining treatment of particular industries or companies. Further, considerable uncertainty exists regarding the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world’s leading economies, including the U.S. and China. Uncertainty or adverse changes to conditions in China or the policies of China’s government or its laws and regulations can adversely affect the overall economic growth of China, or of the particular industries in which we participate, and can adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our growth can suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve, and visibility into our markets can be limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets can diminish demand for our products and services and adversely affect our business and financial statements. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that have experienced and may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies, and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities. Demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, marketing or promotional programs, new product introductions, the timing of industry trade shows and changes in distributor or customer inventory levels due to distributor or customer management thereof or other factors. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business and financial statements in any given period.Certain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other third-parties for development, supply and marketing of certain products, potential products and technologies, and such collaborative partners or other third-parties could fail to perform sufficiently.For certain of our businesses, success in penetrating target markets depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies. Relying on collaborative relationships is risky because, among other things, our collaborative partners may (1) not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations; (2) fail to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner; (3) be acquired by other companies and terminate our collaborative partnership or become insolvent; (4) compete with us; (5) disagree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship; (6) have insufficient capital resources; (7) decline to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms; and (8) fail to comply with applicable laws, regulatory requirements and/or applicable contractual obligations. Because these and other factors may be beyond our control, the development or commercialization of our products involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. In addition, if we or any of our collaborative 20partners terminate a collaborative arrangement, we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or we may need to cancel some development programs, which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Acquisition, Divestiture and Investment RisksAny inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices, and to make appropriate investments that support our long-term strategy, could negatively impact our business.Our ability to grow revenues, earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies, and to make appropriate investments that support our long-term strategy. We may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past, which could adversely impact our business. Promising acquisitions and investments are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including high valuations, competition among prospective buyers or investors, the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain applicable antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms. In addition, competition for acquisitions and investments has resulted and may result in higher purchase prices. Changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions and investments.Our acquisition of businesses, investments, joint ventures and other strategic relationships can negatively impact our business and financial statements.As part of our business strategy, we acquire businesses, make investments and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course, and we also from time to time complete more significant transactions; refer to MD&A for additional details. Acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges, including but not limited to the following, any of which could adversely affect our business and our financial statements:•businesses, technologies, services and products that we acquire or invest in sometimes under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid, fail to perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable or fail to achieve and/or sustain profitability;•we from time to time incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships, which can also cause a deterioration of Danaher’s credit ratings, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense and diminish our future access to the capital markets;•acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships can cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations in any given period, or over the long-term;•pre-closing and post-closing earnings charges can adversely impact our results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period-to-period;•acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships can create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address;•we can experience difficulty in integrating cultures, personnel, operations and financial and other controls and systems and retaining key employees and customers, and former employees of businesses we acquire may compete with us;•we may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition, investment, joint venture or strategic relationship;•we have assumed and may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company’s or investee’s activities; and the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies can increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations;•in connection with acquisitions and joint ventures, we often enter into post-closing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments, earn-out obligations and indemnification obligations, which can have unpredictable financial results;21•as a result of our acquisitions and investments, we have recorded significant goodwill and other assets on our balance sheet and if we are not able to realize the value of these assets, or if the value of our investments declines, we are required to incur impairment charges;•we may have interests that diverge from those of our joint venture partners or other strategic partners or the companies we invest in, and we may not be able to direct or influence the management and operations of the joint venture, other strategic relationship or investee in the manner we believe is most appropriate, exposing us to additional risk; and•investing in or making loans to early-stage companies often entails a high degree of risk, including uncertainty regarding the company’s ability to successfully develop new technologies and services, bring these new technologies and services to market and gain market acceptance, maintain adequate capitalization and access to cash or other forms of liquidity, and retain critical management personnel; we do not always achieve the strategic, technological, financial or commercial benefits we anticipate; we may lose our investment or fail to recoup our loan; or our investment may be illiquid for a greater-than-expected period of time.The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the acquired company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. In addition, we obtain or receive the benefits of representations and warranties insurance in connection with certain acquisitions. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions or insurance coverages will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our business and financial statements.Divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we or our predecessors have disposed could adversely affect our business and financial statements.We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest, spin-off, split-off or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. For example, in 2015 Danaher separated and split-off to Danaher shareholders the majority of its former communications business in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction with NetScout Systems, Inc. (the “Communications Disposition”), in 2016 Danaher separated and spun-off to Danaher shareholders its former Test & Measurement segment, Industrial Technologies segment (excluding the product identification businesses) and retail/commercial petroleum business (collectively known as “Fortive Corporation”) (the “Fortive Disposition”), and in 2019 Danaher consummated the separation and initial public offering (“IPO”) and subsequent split-off of its Dental segment, known as Envista Holdings Corporation (the “Envista Disposition”). Transactions such as these pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements. For example, when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not become satisfied. In addition, divestitures or other dispositions can dilute the Company’s earnings per share, have other adverse financial, tax and accounting impacts and distract management, and disputes can arise with buyers. In addition, we have retained responsibility for and/or have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we or our predecessors have sold or disposed. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our business or financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.Potential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the Communications Disposition, the Fortive Disposition or the Envista Disposition could adversely affect our business and financial statements.With respect to each of the Communications Disposition, the Fortive Disposition and the Envista Disposition, we entered into a separation agreement and related agreements to govern the separation and related transactions and the relationship between the respective companies going forward. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party that can lead to disputes between us and the respective counterparty. If we are required to indemnify any of the other parties under the circumstances set forth in these agreements, we may be subject to substantial liabilities. In addition, with respect to the liabilities for which the other parties have agreed to indemnify us under these agreements, there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against such other parties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of the liabilities, or that such other parties will be able to fully satisfy their respective indemnification obligations. It is also possible that a court could disregard the allocation of assets and liabilities agreed to between Danaher and such other parties and require Danaher to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to such other parties. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business and financial statements.22We could incur significant liability if any of the Communications Disposition, the Fortive Disposition or the Envista Disposition is determined to be a taxable transaction.We have received opinions from outside tax counsel to the effect that each of the Communications Disposition, the Fortive Disposition and the Envista Disposition qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code. These opinions rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, our stockholders and we may not be able to rely on the respective opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) could determine on audit that any such transactions are taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the respective opinion. If any such transaction is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.Operational RisksSignificant disruptions in, or breaches in security of, our information technology systems or data or violation of data privacy laws can adversely affect our business and financial statements.We rely on information technology systems, some of which are provided and/or managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personal data relating to employees, customers, other business partners and patients), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as receiving and fulfilling orders, billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations). In addition, some of our remote monitoring products and services incorporate software and information technology that house personal data and some products or software we sell to customers connect to our systems for maintenance or other purposes. These systems, products and services (including those we acquire through business acquisitions) can be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, human error or malfeasance (including by employees), power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Attacks can also target hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. Security breaches of systems provided or enabled by us, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services, or security breaches of third-party suppliers we rely on to process, store or transmit electronic information, can result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers, patients or suppliers. Like most multinational corporations, our information technology systems and data have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. Unauthorized tampering, adulteration or interference with our products may also adversely affect product functionality and result in loss of data, risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions. The attacks, breaches, misappropriations and other disruptions and damage described above can interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, result in disclosure of personal data, damage customer, patient, business partner and employee relationships and our reputation and result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy and other laws and increased costs for security and remediation, in each case resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial statements. Our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches. In addition, our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving legal and regulatory standards, evolving customer expectations, changes in the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data and information systems, and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully maintain, enhance and upgrade our systems as necessary to effectively address these requirements. Further, a greater number of our employees have been working remotely since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, which exposes us to greater cybersecurity risks.Any inability to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches can result in adverse regulatory and business consequences and litigation. As a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. Please see “Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters” for additional information. For example, entities that are 23found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured patient health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EU member states may result in fines of up to €20 million or up to 4% of total worldwide annual turnover for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties. Several other countries such as China and Russia have passed, and other countries are considering passing, laws that require some or all personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. A broad California privacy law came into effect in January 2020 with some of the same features as the GDPR, which has already prompted other states to enact or consider enacting similar laws. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to customer, patient, business partner and employee relationships and to our reputation, any of which may adversely affect our business and financial statements. In addition, compliance with the varying data privacy regulations across the U.S. and around the world has required significant expenditures and may require additional expenditures, and may require further changes in our products or business models that increase competition or reduce revenue.Defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products or services, or allegations thereof, can adversely affect our business and financial statements.Manufacturing or design defects or “bugs” in, unanticipated use of, safety or quality issues (or the perception of such issues) with respect to, “off label” use of, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell (including items that we source from third-parties) can lead to personal injury, death, and/or property damage and adversely affect our business and financial statements. These events can lead to recalls or safety alerts, result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us. Recalls, removals and product liability and similar claims (regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome) can result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. Our business can also be affected by studies of the utilization, safety and efficacy of medical device products and components that are conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. Any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of product issues, including claims by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class.If we suffer loss to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed.Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, cyber-attack, earthquake, hurricane, power shortage or outage, public health crisis (including epidemics and pandemics) and the reaction thereto, war, terrorism, riot, public protest or other natural or man-made disasters, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the damage caused to our facilities by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017. If any of these facilities, supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, diminish demand, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and significant repair or replacement expenses. The third-party insurance coverage that we maintain varies from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against such losses.Climate change, or legal or regulatory measures to address climate change, may negatively affect us.Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our operations. Physical risk resulting from acute changes (such as hurricane, tornado, wildfire or flooding) or chronic changes (such as droughts, heat waves or sea level changes) in climate patterns can adversely impact our facilities and operations and disrupt our supply chains and distribution systems. Concern over climate change can also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment (such as taxation of, or caps on the use of, carbon-based energy). Any such new or additional legal or regulatory requirements may increase the costs associated with, or disrupt, sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely affect our business and financial statements. In addition, any failure to adequately address stakeholder expectations with respect to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters may result in the loss of business, adverse reputational impacts, diluted market valuations and challenges in attracting and retaining customers and talented employees.24The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products, our business and financial statements could suffer.The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems can arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or components, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and environmental factors, and if not discovered before the product is released to market can result in recalls and product liability exposure. Because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities and other stringent regulations of the FDA and similar agencies regarding the manufacture of certain of our products, an alternative manufacturer is not always available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity. Any of these manufacturing problems could result in adverse impacts to our business and financial statements.If we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand, our business and financial statements may suffer. In addition, our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials, components and services can cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies.We purchase materials, components and equipment from third-parties for use in our manufacturing operations, including metallic-based components, electronic components, chemistries, OEM products, plastics and other petroleum-based products. Our profitability could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations, including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality. During a market upturn, suppliers from time to time extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices. If we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand, we may not be able to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed, our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities. Please see “Item 1. Business—Materials” for a discussion of certain supply chain constraints we experienced in 2021. Conversely, in order to secure supplies for the production of products, we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors, which can impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our business and financial statements may suffer.In addition, some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, regulatory requirements, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. If these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. The supply chains for our businesses can also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, war, terrorist actions, governmental actions (such as trade protectionism) and legislative or regulatory changes. Any of these factors can result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies.Because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, at times our manufacturing capacity exceeds or falls short of our production requirements. Any or all of these problems can result in the loss of customers or cost inefficiencies, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial statements.Adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition, performance, purchasing patterns or inventory levels of, key distributors and other channel partners can adversely affect our business and financial statements.Certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to or through key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and end-users. Some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products or compete with us directly, and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. Adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners, reduction or discontinuation of their purchases from us or adverse developments in their financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns, can adversely affect our business and financial statements. The levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners, and changes in those levels, also impacts our results of operations in any given period. In addition, the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries can adversely impact our business and financial statements.25Our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of the supplies that we use in, and the labor we need for, our operations.As discussed in “Item 1. Business—Materials,” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components, raw materials and other commodities. Prices for and availability of these components, raw materials and other commodities, as well as for labor, have fluctuated significantly in the past. Please see “Item 1. Business—Materials” for a discussion of the supply chain and labor availability disruptions and constraints our businesses are currently facing, and the adverse impacts that we have incurred and may incur relating thereto. Any sustained interruption in the supply of, or increase in the cost of, key components, raw materials, other commodities and labor can adversely affect our business and financial statements. In addition, due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve, the cost-containment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to, when supply and labor prices rise we are not always able to pass along cost increases through higher prices for our products. If we are unable to fully recover higher supply and labor costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions, or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs, our margins and profitability could decline and our business and financial statements could be adversely affected.Our success depends on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences and skill sets.The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industries, particularly in the areas of science and technology, is extremely competitive. In addition, in 2021 a number of our businesses faced certain labor availability constraints and labor cost inflation. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain and motivate highly skilled workers and key leaders representing diverse backgrounds, experiences and skill sets, our business and financial statements may be adversely affected. Our restructuring actions can have long-term adverse effects on our business and financial statements.We have implemented significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. These restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities (including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses) reduce our available talent, assets and other resources and can slow improvements in our products and services, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers, limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases and trigger adverse public attention. In addition, delays or failures in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements on the anticipated timeline or at all may diminish the expected operational or financial benefits from such actions. Any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements.Work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations.Certain of our U.S. and non-U.S. employees are subject to collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes that could adversely impact our business and financial statements.Intellectual Property RisksIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third-parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights. These risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of intellectual property comparable to the United States.Many of the markets we serve are technology-driven, and as a result intellectual property rights play a significant role in product development and differentiation. We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our business. The intellectual property rights that we obtain, however, are not always sufficiently broad and do not always provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. In addition, the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property do not always prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented, designed-around or becoming subject to compulsory licensing. In some circumstances, enforcement is not available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that 26others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third-parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage and adequately protect our intellectual property; our failure to detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights each can adversely impact our business and financial statements.These risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of corporate proprietary information, intellectual property, technology and other assets comparable to the United States. The risks we encounter in such countries include but are not limited to the following:•Joint ventures that we participate in can include restrictions that could compromise our control over the intellectual property, technology and proprietary information of the joint venture;•As we expand our operations globally, increasing amounts of our data, intellectual property and technology is used and stored in countries outside the United States, and regulations in certain countries require data to be stored locally. These factors increase the risk that such data, intellectual property and technology could be stolen or otherwise compromised;•Certain of our products have been counterfeited and we may encounter additional and/or increased levels of counterfeiting in the future;•Governmental entities may adopt regulations or other requirements that give them rights to certain of our intellectual property, technology and/or proprietary information, such as through compulsory licensing or ownership restrictions or requirements;•In certain countries, we do not have the same ability to enforce intellectual property rights as we do in the U.S.; •Governmental regulations relating to state secrecy or other topics limit our ability to transfer data or technology out of certain jurisdictions; and•Risks, costs and challenges of operating in a particular jurisdiction can result in a decision to relocate or divert operations to a different jurisdiction, potentially at higher cost.Any of these risks can adversely impact our business and financial statements. Refer to “—International economic, political, legal, compliance, social and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements” for a discussion of additional risks relating to our international operations.Third-parties from time to time claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.From time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation of third parties’ intellectual property and cannot be certain that the conduct of our business does not and will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of others. Disputes or litigations regarding intellectual property can be costly and time-consuming to defend due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to critical technology, be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services, be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights, be required to license technology or other intellectual property rights from others, be required to cease marketing, manufacturing or using certain products or be required to redesign, re-engineer or re-brand our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our business and financial statements. Third-party intellectual property rights may also make it more difficult or expensive for us to meet market demand for particular product or design innovations. When we are required to seek licenses under patents or other intellectual property rights of others, we are not always able to acquire these licenses on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.The U.S. government has certain rights with respect to incremental production capacity and/or the intellectual property we have developed using government financing.Certain agencies of the U.S. government, such as the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, have agreed to finance an expansion of production capacity and/or the development of technology at certain of our businesses, and our businesses may enter into similar agreements in the future. 27In consideration of this financing the U.S. government has certain rights, including rights with respect to the allocation of certain of the incremental production capacity associated with such expansion and/or rights in intellectual property produced with its financial assistance. Government rights in inventions conceived or reduced to practice under a government-funded program can include a nonexclusive, royalty-free worldwide license to practice or have practiced such inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the U.S. government has the right to require us or our licensors (as applicable) to grant licenses which would be exclusive under any of such inventions to a third-party if they determine that: (1) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize such inventions in a particular field of use; (2) such action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (3) such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations. Further, government rights include the right to use and disclose, without limitation, technical data relating to licensed technology that was developed in whole or in part at government expense.We are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations relating to the administration and performance of our obligations under these agreements, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”) and agency-specific regulations supplemental to the FAR, business ethics and public integrity obligations, export and import control laws and regulations, and regulations and standards relating to our accounting practices. In addition, if the U.S. government terminates one or more of these contracts with us for its convenience, or if we default by failing to perform in accordance with the contract schedule and terms, a negative impact on our business and financial statements could result.Financial and Tax RisksOur outstanding debt has increased significantly as a result of acquisitions, and we may incur additional debt in the future. Our existing and future indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and negatively impact our credit ratings; and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and financial statements.As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $22.2 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we had the ability to incur approximately $2.2 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under our credit facilities that were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances. Our debt level and related debt service obligations (as well as the dividend obligations pursuant to our Series A and Series B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“MCPS”)) can have negative consequences, including (1) requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt (or dividends on our MCPS), which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and other investments; (2) reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and (3) exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates.If our credit ratings are downgraded or put on watch for a potential downgrade, we may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in the amounts, at the times or interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if our current credit ratings were maintained.Our credit facilities and long-term debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us, including certain restrictions on our ability to incur liens on our assets, and a requirement under our credit facilities to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus shareholders’ equity) of 0.65 to 1.0 or less. If we breach any of these restrictions and cannot obtain a waiver from the lenders on favorable terms, subject to applicable cure periods, the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which would adversely affect our business and financial statements (including our liquidity). If we add new debt in the future, the risks described above would increase.We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.As of December 31, 2021, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $64.0 billion. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets, changes in the structure of our business, divestitures, market capitalization declines, or increases in associated discount rates can impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments adversely affect our financial statements in the periods recognized.Foreign currency exchange rates can adversely affect our financial statements.Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which can adversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices. 28Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar adversely affects the cost of materials, products and services we purchase overseas. Sales and expenses of our non-U.S. businesses are also translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar generally results in unfavorable translation effects. In addition, certain of our businesses invoice customers in a currency other than the business’ functional currency, and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency can also result in unfavorable translation effects. The Company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries.Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments can affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities can result in additional tax payments for prior periods.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was enacted. The TCJA significantly revised the U.S. federal corporate income tax law by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate to 21.0%, implementing a quasi-territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time tax on unremitted cumulative non-U.S. earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries (“Transition Tax”).Due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the TCJA), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our intercompany arrangements, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, our estimates of effective tax rate and income tax assets and liabilities can be incorrect and our financial statements could be adversely affected; please refer to MD&A for a discussion of additional factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period. The impact of the factors referenced in the preceding sentence may be substantially different from period-to-period.In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities, such as the audits described in MD&A and the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. If audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our results can be adversely affected. Any further changes to the tax system in the United States or in other jurisdictions (including changes in the taxation of non-U.S. income as further described below) could also adversely affect our financial statements. Changes in tax law relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect our tax position.The U.S. Congress, government agencies in non-U.S. jurisdictions where we do business, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) have focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting,” for which the OECD has released several components of its comprehensive plan that have been adopted and expanded by many taxing authorities to address perceived tax abuse and inconsistencies between tax jurisdictions. As a result, the tax laws in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Legal, political, and economic uncertainty surrounding the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU could have an adverse effect on our business and financial statements.The UK ceased to be a member state of the EU on January 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”), and the parties have agreed to and ratified a trade and cooperation agreement. Uncertainties remain regarding the application of the terms of the trade and cooperation agreement and the other potential impacts of Brexit, such as the impact of new or different laws and regulations as the UK replaces or replicates certain EU laws, and trade and tax impacts as the UK negotiates its own tax and trade treaties with countries around the world. The impacts from Brexit could adversely affect our business and financial statements. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had eight manufacturing facilities in the UK and the Company’s net investment in property, plant and equipment in the UK was $260 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, less than 5% of our sales were derived from customers located in the UK, however, the impact of Brexit could also impact our business and financial statements outside the UK.Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements.The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets, investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates can increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements. In addition, upward pressure on the cost of providing health care coverage to current employees and retirees can increase our future funding obligations and adversely affect our financial statements.29Legal, Regulatory, Compliance and Reputational RisksSignificant developments or changes in U.S. laws or policies can have an adverse effect on our business and financial statements.Significant developments or changes in U.S. laws and policies, such as laws and policies governing non-U.S. trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate, or governing the health care system and drug prices, can adversely affect our business and financial statements. For example, in recent years the U.S. has increased tariffs on certain imported goods and trade tensions between the U.S. and China escalated, with each country imposing significant, additional tariffs on a wide range of goods imported from the other country. The U.S. and China could impose other types of restrictions such as limitations on government procurement or technology export restrictions, which could affect our access to markets. These factors have adversely affected, and in the future could further adversely affect, our business and financial statements.Our business and financial statements can be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems, including our Code of Conduct, always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that violate laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, economic and trade sanctions, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct, and violations of such code of conduct could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements.In addition to the environmental, health, safety, health care, medical device, anticorruption, data privacy and other regulations noted elsewhere in this Annual Report, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional levels, including the following:•We are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons and dealings between our employees and between our subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory. In addition, we sell and provide products and technology to third parties, such as agents, representatives and distributors, who may export such items to end-users, and if any of these third parties do not comply with applicable export or import laws we may incur liability. In addition, from time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions. These business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures have prevented and will prevent violations of these regulations and any violation can adversely affect our business and financial statements.•We also have agreements to sell products and services to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with government entities (less than 5% of our 2021 sales were made to the U.S. federal government). The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. Our agreements with government entities are in some cases subject to termination, reduction or modification at the convenience of the government or in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors, and we may underestimate our costs of performing 30under the contract. In certain cases, a governmental entity may require us to pay back amounts it has paid to us. Government contracts that have been awarded to us following a bid process can become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder, which could result in loss of the contract. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts. These are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. The regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and can be inconsistent across jurisdictions. We, our representatives and the industries in which we operate are at times under review and/or investigation by regulatory authorities. Failure to comply (or any alleged or perceived failure to comply) with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations can result in import detentions, fines, damages, civil and administrative penalties, injunctions, consent decrees, suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts, disbarment from selling to certain governmental agencies or exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disruption of our business, limitation on our ability to manufacture, import, export and sell products and services, loss of customers, significant legal and investigatory fees, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, reputational harm, contractual damages, diminished profits, curtailment or restricting of business operations, criminal prosecution and other monetary and non-monetary penalties. Compliance with these and other regulations can also affect our returns on investment, require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our business. Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the International Standards Organization, and failure to comply with these rules can result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our business and financial statements. For additional information regarding these risks, refer to “Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters.”We are subject to or otherwise responsible for a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that can adversely affect our business and financial statements.We are subject to or otherwise responsible for a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business (or related to the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims or counterclaims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, breach of contract claims, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage, securities matters, fiduciary duties and acquisition or divestiture-related matters, as well as regulatory subpoenas, requests for information, investigations and enforcement. We also from time to time become subject to lawsuits as a result of acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, businesses divested by us or our predecessors. The types of claims made in lawsuits include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages (and in some cases, treble damages) and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits can divert our management’s attention, we from time to time incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we can be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that adversely affect our business and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, new developments (including litigation developments, the discovery of new facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases), changes in assumptions or changes in the Company’s strategy in any given period can require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments can adversely affect our business and financial statements in any particular period. We cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with current and future litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and business. However, based on our experience, information and applicable law as of the date of this Annual Report, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2021 will have a material effect on our business or financial statements.From time to time, we become aware through our internal audits and other internal control procedures, employees or other parties of possible compliance matters, such as complaints or concerns relating to accounting, internal controls, financial reporting, auditing or ethical matters or relating to compliance with laws. When we become aware of such possible compliance matters, we investigate internally and take what we believe to be appropriate corrective action. Internal investigations can lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of legal or regulatory proceedings against us and adversely affect our business and financial statements.31Certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and by comparable agencies of other countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information. Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the FDA, by other federal and state governmental agencies, by comparable agencies of other countries and regions, by certain accrediting bodies and by regulations governing hazardous materials and drugs-of-abuse (or the manufacture and sale of products containing any such materials). The global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent and unpredictable. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years, and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, their existing regulations. Please see “Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters” for more information. Failure to meet these requirements can adversely impact our business and financial statements in the applicable geographies.To varying degrees, these regulators require us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution and post-marketing surveillance of our products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance (such as 510(k) clearance) or approvals for our new products or modifications to (or additional indications or uses of) existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be time-consuming, costly and subject to restrictions. Our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors, for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results, and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained. Even after initial regulatory clearance or approval, we are subject to periodic inspection by these regulatory authorities, and if safety issues arise we can be required to amend conditions for use of a product, such as providing additional warnings on the product’s label or narrowing its approved intended use, which could reduce the product’s market acceptance. We are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse, research and development, pricing and sales and marketing practices, the privacy and security of health information as well as manufacturing and quality standards, including the federal regulations described in “Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters.” Government authorities may conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law. Failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products (or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products), other violations of laws or regulations, failure to remediate inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products (even after obtaining clearance for distribution) and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to FDA Form 483 Inspectional Observations, warning letters, notices to customers, declining sales, loss of customers, loss of market share, remediation and increased compliance costs, recalls, seizures of adulterated or misbranded products, fines, expenses, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal penalties, consent decrees, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, narrowing of permitted uses for a product, refusal of the government to grant 510(k) clearance, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, pre-market notification rescissions and other adverse effects referenced under the risk factor titled “Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements.” Further, defending against any such actions can be costly and time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions brought against us, our business may be impaired. Ensuring that our operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations also involves substantial costs. Our products can be subject to human clinical trials, the results of which may be unexpected, or perceived as unfavorable by the market, and could adversely affect our business and financial statements.As a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for certain new products and new indications for certain existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unexpected or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials, or a regulator’s or the market’s perception of these clinical data, can adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate and our business and financial statements.32Off-label marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties.The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about approved or cleared products. In particular, any clearances we may receive only permit us to market our products for the intended uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the FDA. We may request additional label indications for our current products, and the FDA may deny those requests outright, require additional performance or clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance. If the FDA or any other federal, state or non-U.S. regulator determines that we have marketed our products for off-label use, we can be subject to exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the other adverse effects referenced under the risk factor titled “Certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and by comparable agencies of other countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information. Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements.” Any of these events could significantly harm our business and financial statements.Certain modifications to our products may require new 510(k) clearances or other marketing authorizations and may require us to recall or cease marketing our products.Once a medical device is permitted to be legally marketed in the United States pursuant to a 510(k) clearance or a premarket approval (“PMA”), a manufacturer may be required to notify the FDA of certain modifications to the device (similar requirements apply in other jurisdictions). Manufacturers determine in the first instance whether a change to a product requires a new 510(k) clearance or premarket submission, but the FDA may review any manufacturer’s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances are necessary. We have made modifications to our products in the past and have determined based on our review of the applicable FDA regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 510(k) clearances or other premarket submissions were not required. We may make similar modifications or add additional features in the future that we believe do not require a new clearance or approval. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations and requires us to submit new 510(k) notifications or PMA applications, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance, and we may be subject to civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation.Our operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our operations, products and services are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the health and safety of our employees, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials, emissions or discharges of substances into the environment, investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites, chemical constituents in products and end-of-life disposal and take-back programs for products sold. We cannot assure you that our environmental, health and safety compliance program (or the compliance programs of businesses we acquire) have been or will at all times be effective. Failure to comply with any of these laws can result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our business or financial statements.In addition, we from time to time incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury, property damage or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury or damage due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. We can also become subject to additional remedial, compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules. For additional information regarding these risks, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. We cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. However, based on the information we have as of the date of this Annual Report we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2021, will have a material effect on our business or financial statements.Changes in governmental regulations can reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses.We compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional regulations, such as regulations governing health and safety, the environment, food and drugs and privacy. We develop, configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations. These 33regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. Any significant change in any of these regulations (or in the interpretation or application thereof) can reduce demand for, increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services, or restrict our existing activities, products and services. For example, a number of our products and services are marketed to the pharmaceutical and related industries for use in discovering and developing drugs and therapies. Changes in the FDA’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process can have an adverse effect on the demand for these products and services. In addition, in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations. In these markets, the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations, the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address or the repeal of existing regulations, can adversely affect demand. In addition, regulatory deadlines can result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period-to-period.Exclusive forum provisions in our By-laws could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose their preferred judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.Our Amended and Restated By-laws (the “By-laws”) provide that unless the Company selects or consents to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for any complaint asserting any internal corporate claims, to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, will be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have, or declines to accept, jurisdiction, another state court or a federal court located within the State of Delaware) (collectively, “Delaware Courts”). Current and former stockholders are deemed to have consented to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts in connection with any action to enforce such exclusive forum provision and to service of process in any such action. These provisions of the By-laws are not a waiver of, and do not relieve anyone of duties to comply with, federal securities laws including those specifying the exclusive jurisdiction of federal courts under the Exchange Act and concurrent jurisdiction of federal and state courts under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. To the extent that the exclusive forum provisions of our By-laws limit a current or former stockholder’s ability to select a judicial forum other than the Delaware Courts, they might discourage the specified legal actions, might cause current or former stockholders to incur additional litigation-related expenses and might result in outcomes unfavorable to current or former stockholders. Alternatively, a court might determine that these provisions of the By-laws are inapplicable or unenforceable in any particular action, in which case we may incur additional litigation-related expenses in such action, and the action may result in outcomes unfavorable to us, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial statements.ITEM 1B.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide material information relevant to an assessment of Danaher’s financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources. The MD&A is designed to focus specifically on material events and uncertainties known to management that are reasonably likely to cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or of future financial condition. This includes descriptions and amounts of matters that have had a material impact on reported operations, as well as matters that are reasonably likely based on management’s assessment to have a material impact on future operations. The Company’s MD&A is divided into five sections:•Overview•Results of Operations•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Critical Accounting Estimates•New Accounting StandardsThis discussion and analysis should be read together with Danaher’s audited financial statements and related Notes thereto as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 included in this Annual Report. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for 2019 is included in Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to the year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and should be referred to for information regarding this period. Unless otherwise indicated, all financial results in this report refer to continuing operations.OVERVIEWGeneralRefer to “Item 1. Business—General” for a discussion of Danaher’s strategic objectives and methodologies for delivering long-term shareholder value. Danaher is a multinational business with global operations. During 2021, approximately 62% of Danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the United States. As a diversified, global business, Danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors. Danaher’s geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of its products and services, help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. The Company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.As a result of the Company’s geographic and industry diversity, the Company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges, including rapid technological development (particularly with respect to computing, automation, artificial intelligence, mobile connectivity, communications and digitization) in most of the Company’s served markets, the expansion and evolution of opportunities in high-growth markets, trends and costs associated with a global labor force, consolidation of the Company’s competitors and increasing regulation. The Company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and the Company’s long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in high-growth geographies and high-growth market segments, identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions and identify and consummate appropriate investments and strategic partnerships, develop innovative and differentiated new products and services with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of the Company’s sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated global environment. The Company is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions and investments, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources (particularly in high-growth markets) in order to be responsive to the Company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the Company’s operations.Business PerformanceConsolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 32.0% as compared to 2020. Foreign currency exchange rates contributed 1.5% and acquisitions contributed 7.5% to the increase in revenues in 2021. Core sales increased 23.0% in 2021 compared to 2020 and core sales including Cytiva increased 25.0% in 2021 compared to 2020 (for the definition of “core sales” and “core sales including Cytiva” refer to “—Results of Operations” below). While differences exist among the 37Table of ContentsCompany’s businesses, on an overall basis, demand for the Company’s products and services increased on a year-over-year basis in 2021 as compared to 2020, and together with the Company’s continued investments in sales growth initiatives and the other business-specific factors contributed to the core sales growth discussed below. As the conditions related to the pandemic improved in many geographies in 2021 compared to 2020, the Company generally experienced increased demand in the end-markets it serves. In addition to the improving pandemic conditions, development and production related to COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics among biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers continued to generate strong demand for bioprocessing and genomic products in the Company’s Life Sciences segment and COVID-19 related testing generated strong demand primarily in the Company’s molecular diagnostics testing business in the Diagnostics segment and in the Company’s flow cytometry, genomics, lab automation, centrifugation, particle counting and characterization business and the genomics consumables business in the Life Sciences segment. Geographically, both high-growth and developed markets contributed to year-over-year core sales growth during 2021. Core sales in developed markets grew more than 20% in 2021 as compared to 2020 and were driven by North America and Western Europe. Core sales in high-growth markets grew approximately 30% in 2021 as compared to 2020, with broad-based growth across these markets, led by growth in China. High-growth markets represented approximately 31% of the Company’s total sales in 2021. The Company’s net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled approximately $6.3 billion, compared to approximately $3.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net earnings attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled approximately $6.3 billion or $8.61 per diluted common share compared to approximately $3.5 billion or $4.89 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net earnings in 2021 as compared to 2020 was driven by increased sales in the Company’s existing businesses and sales from acquired businesses, partially offset by the impact of the modification and partial termination of a prior commercial arrangement and resolution of the associated litigation. Refer to “—Results of Operations” for further discussion of the year-over-year changes in net earnings and diluted net earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2021. For a discussion of the impact of supply chain disruptions, labor availability constraints and increased labor costs on our businesses in 2021, please see “Item 1. Business – Materials.”The COVID-19 PandemicThe global spread of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to unprecedented restrictions on, and disruptions in, business and personal activities, including as a result of preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses, our communities and governments have taken and are taking to mitigate the spread of the virus and to manage its impact. The Company continues to actively monitor the pandemic, including the current spread of certain variants of the virus, and has taken and intends to continue taking steps to identify and seek to mitigate the adverse impacts on, and risks to, the Company’s business (including but not limited to its employees, customers, business partners, manufacturing capabilities and capacity, and supply and distribution channels) posed by the spread of COVID-19 and the governmental and community responses thereto. The Company’s businesses have activated their business continuity plans as a result of this pandemic, including taking steps in an effort to help keep our workforce healthy and safe, and are assessing and updating those plans on an ongoing basis. As a result of COVID-19 the Company’s businesses have modified certain of their respective business practices, and the Company expects to take such further actions as may be required by government authorities or as determined to be in the best interests of our employees, customers and other business partners. The Company has developed and is implementing return-to-workplace protocols designed to help ensure the health and safety of its employees, customers and business partners, for its businesses to apply as appropriate. Given that the prevalence of COVID-19 and the nature of the response thereto (including the degree to which restrictions are being relaxed or re-imposed) varies significantly by geography, the impact of the pandemic on the Company’s different business locations around the world at any given time also varies significantly. We are also deploying our capabilities, expertise and scale to address the critical health needs related to COVID-19. We have developed and made available diagnostic tests for the rapid detection of COVID-19. In addition, our businesses are providing critical support to firms that are developing and producing vaccines and therapies for COVID-19, among other support. While we expect overall demand for the Company’s COVID-19 related products to moderate as and to the extent the pandemic subsides, as the pandemic evolves toward endemic status we believe a level of demand for the Company’s products that support COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics (including initiatives that seek to prevent or mitigate similar, future pandemics) and COVID-19 testing will continue. However, on a relative basis, we expect the level of ongoing demand for products supporting COVID-19 testing will be subject to more fluctuations in demand than the level of demand for products supporting COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics. The Company’s ability to satisfy COVID-19 related demand will also depend in part upon the expansion of our production capacity in these areas. Due to the speed with which the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, the global breadth of its spread, the range of governmental and community responses thereto and our geographic and business line diversity, its further impact on our 38Table of Contentsbusiness remains highly uncertain, but may be materially negative to certain elements of our business. The potential negative impact will depend on future developments including but not limited to:•the degree of spread and severity of COVID-19 variants such as Omicron; and•the timing and durability of continued recovery in the global demand for our non-COVID-19 related products and services.For additional information on the risks of COVID-19 to the Company’s operations, refer to the “Item 1A. Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report. Acquisitions On August 30, 2021, the Company acquired Aldevron, L.L.C. (“Aldevron”) for a cash purchase price of approximately $9.6 billion (the “Aldevron Acquisition”). Aldevron manufactures high-quality plasmid DNA, mRNA and proteins, serving biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers across research, clinical and commercial applications, and is now part of the Company’s Life Sciences segment. Aldevron generated revenues of approximately $300 million in 2020. The acquisition of Aldevron is expected to provide additional sales and earnings opportunities for the Company by expanding product line diversity, including new product offerings supporting genomic medicine. The Company financed the Aldevron Acquisition using cash on hand and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. In addition to the Aldevron Acquisition, during 2021 the Company acquired 13 other businesses for total consideration of approximately $1.4 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company’s three segments. The aggregate annual sales of the 13 other businesses acquired in 2021 at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $100 million. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion regarding the Company’s acquisitions. RESULTS OF OPERATIONSIn this report, references to the non-GAAP measures of core sales (also referred to as core revenues or sales/revenues from existing businesses) and core sales including Cytiva refer to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) but excluding:•sales from acquired businesses (as defined below, as applicable); and•the impact of currency translation.References to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less any sales and operating profit, during the applicable period, attributable to divested product lines not considered discontinued operations; provided that in calculating core sales including Cytiva, Cytiva’s sales (net of the sales of the Company product lines divested in 2020 to obtain regulatory approval to acquire Cytiva, or the “divested product lines”) (“Cytiva sales”) are excluded from the definition of sales attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between:•the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses (as defined above, as applicable)); and•the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses (as defined above, as applicable)) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period.As noted above, beginning with results for the second quarter of 2020, the Company also presents core sales on a basis that includes Cytiva sales. Prior to the acquisition of Cytiva, Danaher calculated core sales solely on a basis that excluded sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition. However, given Cytiva’s significant size and historical core sales growth rate, in each case compared to Danaher’s existing businesses, management believes it is appropriate to also present core sales on a basis that includes Cytiva sales. Management believes this presentation provides useful information to investors by demonstrating beginning immediately after the acquisition Cytiva’s impact on the Company’s growth profile, rather than waiting to demonstrate such impact until 12 months after the acquisition when Cytiva would normally have been included in Danaher’s core sales calculation. Danaher calculates period-to-period core sales growth including Cytiva by adding Cytiva sales to core sales for both the baseline and current periods. Beginning in the second quarter 39Table of Contentsof 2021, Cytiva sales are included in core sales, and therefore the measure “core sales including Cytiva” is no longer provided for quarterly periods beginning with the second quarter of 2021.Core sales growth (and the related measure of core sales including Cytiva) should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in Danaher’s business and facilitating comparisons of Danaher’s revenue performance with its performance in prior and future periods and to Danaher’s peers. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures to measure the Company’s operating and financial performance, and uses core sales growth as one of the performance measures in the Company’s executive short-term cash incentive program. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from these measures because currency translation is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions (other than Cytiva sales, in the case of core sales growth including Cytiva) and divestiture-related items because the nature, size, timing and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period-to-period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.Throughout this discussion, references to sales growth or decline refer to the impact of both price and unit sales and references to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies resulting from the ongoing application of DBS.The Company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant (generally relating to the Company’s larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for Danaher in a given period.Core Sales Growth and Core Sales Growth Including Cytiva 2021 vs. 20202020 vs. 2019Total sales growth (GAAP)32.0 %24.5 %Impact of:Acquisitions/divestitures(7.5)%(18.0)%Currency exchange rates (1.5)%— %Core sales growth (non-GAAP)23.0 %6.5 %Impact of Cytiva sales growth (net of divested product lines)2.0 %3.0 %Core sales growth including Cytiva (non-GAAP)25.0 %9.5 %2021 Sales Compared to 2020Total sales increased 32.0% on a year-over-year basis in 2021 primarily as a result of an increase in core sales resulting from the factors discussed below by segment as well as an increase in sales from acquired businesses, net of divestitures, primarily due to the acquisition of Cytiva. The impact of currency translation increased reported sales by 1.5% on a year-over-year basis in 2021 primarily due to the favorable impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against most other major currencies in 2021. Operating Profit PerformanceOperating profit margins were 25.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 19.0% in 2020. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.2021 vs. 2020 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by: •Higher 2021 core sales volumes, an increased proportion of sales of higher margin product lines, incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with continuing productivity improvement initiatives and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates in 2021, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various new product development and sales, service and marketing growth investments and incremental year-over-year material and labor costs - 560 basis points •2020 acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue, transaction costs deemed significant and integration preparation costs, net of 2021 acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue in each case related to the acquisition of Cytiva - 210 basis points. •The incremental accretive effect in 2021 of acquired businesses, net of product line dispositions which did not qualify as discontinued operations - 60 basis points40Table of Contents•First quarter 2020 impairment charges related to a facility in the Diagnostics segment and a trade name and other intangible assets in the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment and a third quarter 2020 impairment charge related to trade names in the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, net of a first quarter 2021 impairment charge related to a trade name in the Diagnostics segment - 5 basis points2021 vs. 2020 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:•Third quarter 2021 impact of the modification and partial termination of a prior commercial arrangement and resolution of the associated litigation - 185 basis points•Full year 2021 acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and transaction costs deemed significant, in each case related to the acquisition of Aldevron - 20 basis pointsBusiness SegmentsSales by business segment for the years ended December 31 are as follows ($ in millions): 202120202019Life Sciences$14,958 $10,576 $6,951 Diagnostics9,844 7,403 6,561 Environmental & Applied Solutions4,651 4,305 4,399 Total$29,453 $22,284 $17,911 For information regarding the Company’s sales by geographical region, refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.LIFE SCIENCESThe Life Sciences segment offers a broad range of instruments and consumables that are primarily used by customers to study the basic building blocks of life, including genes, proteins, metabolites and cells, in order to understand the causes of disease, identify new therapies, and test and manufacture new drugs and vaccines.

During 2021, total Life Sciences segment sales increased 41.5% primarily as a result of increased core sales resulting from the factors discussed below and increased sales from acquisitions. In addition, the impact of currency translation increased reported sales by 2.0% in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the favorable impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar in 2021 compared to 2020. On an overall basis, in 2021 the Life Sciences segment saw continued strong demand for products supporting customers in the pursuit and production of COVID-19-related vaccines and therapeutics as well as broad strength across its other product lines. In 2021, core sales for the filtration, separation and purification technologies business increased compared to 2020 due to strong demand for these products led by the biopharmaceutical and the microelectronics end-markets, partially offset by weaker demand in the aerospace end-market. Geographically, core sales for the business were led by North America, Western Europe and China. Core sales for the Company’s flow cytometry, genomics, lab automation, centrifugation, particle counting and characterization business increased in 2021 across all major geographies, led by North America and Western Europe. Core sales for the business were driven by demand earlier in the year for genomic sample preparation consumables related to COVID-19 as well as demand for flow cytometry products. Core sales in the mass spectrometry business increased in 2021 across all major end-markets driven in part by demand for new products. Geographically, demand for these products increased across all major geographies, led by North America, Western Europe and China. The acquisitions of Cytiva on March 31, 2020 (the “Cytiva Acquisition”) and Aldevron on August 30, 2021 have provided, and are expected to continue to provide, additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Company’s Life Sciences segment by expanding the business’ geographic and product line diversity, including new product and service offerings that complement the Company’s bioprocessing workflow and genomic medicine solutions. In 2021, Cytiva experienced significant increased year-over-year demand across all major geographies, driven by continued strong demand for instruments and consumables used in the research and development and production of COVID-19 related treatments and vaccines and increased demand for non-COVID 19 related products as well as by the completion of a major project in China. Since acquisition, Aldevron has seen sales growth in all major product lines compared to the prior year period.Operating Profit PerformanceOperating profit margins increased 980 basis points during 2021 as compared to 2020. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.2021 vs. 2020 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:•Higher 2021 core sales volumes, an increased proportion of sales of higher margin product lines, incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with continuing productivity improvement initiatives and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates in 2021, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various new product development and sales and marketing growth investments and incremental year-over-year material and labor costs - 500 basis points•2020 acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue, transaction costs deemed significant and integration preparation costs, net of 2021 acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue in each case related to the acquisition of Cytiva - 440 basis points•The incremental accretive effect in 2021 of acquired businesses, net of product line dispositions which did not qualify as discontinued operations - 80 basis points2021 vs. 2020 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:•Full year 2021 acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and transaction costs deemed significant, in each case related to the acquisition of Aldevron - 40 basis pointsDepreciation and amortization of intangible assets as a percentage of sales were relatively consistent in 2021 as compared with 2020.DIAGNOSTICSThe Diagnostics segment offers clinical instruments, reagents, consumables, software and services that hospitals, physicians’ offices, reference laboratories and other critical care settings use to diagnose disease and make treatment decisions. 42Table of ContentsDiagnostics Selected Financial Data Year Ended December 31($ in millions)202120202019Sales$9,844 $7,403 $6,561 Operating profit2,313 1,538 1,134 Depreciation 409 397 376 Amortization of intangible assets205 205 206 Operating profit as a % of sales23.5 %20.8 %17.3 %Depreciation as a % of sales4.2 %5.4 %5.7 %Amortization as a % of sales2.1 %2.8 %3.1 %Core Sales Growth 2021 vs. 20202020 vs. 2019Total sales growth (GAAP)33.0 %13.0 %Impact of:Acquisitions/divestitures(0.5)%— %Currency exchange rates (1.5)%0.5 %Core sales growth (non-GAAP)31.0 %13.5 %2021 Sales Compared to 2020 Price increases in the segment contributed 0.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2021 as compared with 2020 and are reflected as a component of the change in core sales growth. During 2021, total Diagnostics segment sales increased 33.0% primarily as a result of increased core sales resulting from the factors discussed below. In addition, the impact of currency translation increased reported sales by 1.5%, primarily due to the favorable impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar in 2021 compared to 2020, and the impact of sales from acquisitions increased reported sales by 0.5% in 2021. During 2021, the Diagnostics segment experienced higher year-over-year sales for molecular diagnostics tests for COVID-19. Demand across the other Diagnostics segment businesses also increased with non-COVID product lines testing volumes improving as individuals resumed visits to healthcare providers following the easing of shutdowns and restrictions related to the pandemic. In 2021, core sales in the segment’s clinical lab business increased on a year-over-year basis across all major geographies driven primarily by continued increased demand in the chemistry and immunoassay product lines. During 2021, core sales in the molecular diagnostics business grew on a year-over-year basis in both developed and high-growth markets, which contributed significantly to overall segment core sales growth. The business continued to experience strong growth in sales of consumables, driven primarily by increased sales of diagnostic test solutions for COVID-19, as increased production capacity allowed the business to produce more diagnostic tests in response to continued market growth, and higher year-over-year demand for testing for non-respiratory diseases. Core sales in the acute care diagnostic business increased year-over-year due to continued strong demand for blood gas consumables and immunoassay products, partially offset by lower year-over-year instrument sales largely due to strong COVID-19 related demand for blood gas instruments in 2020. Geographically, demand was strong across most major geographies. Core sales in the pathology business grew year-over-year across all major geographies, driven by increased demand for core histology, advanced staining and pathology imaging products.Operating Profit PerformanceOperating profit margins increased 270 basis points during 2021 as compared to 2020.

The impact of currency translation increased reported sales 1.5% in 2021, primarily due to the favorable impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar in 2021 compared to 2020. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, decreased reported sales by 1.5% in 2021. On an overall basis, in 2021 the segment’s water quality businesses increased at a mid-single digit rate due to continuing demand for consumables and increased demand for equipment on a year-over-year basis, driven in part by the recovery from the decline in equipment demand in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Year-over-year core sales in the analytical instrumentation product line increased driven by demand in North America, Western Europe and China and by demand in the municipal and industrial end-markets. Core sales in the chemical treatment solutions product line increased as a result of demand in the chemical, commercial and industry and food and beverage end-markets, driven by North America.44Table of ContentsThe segment’s product identification businesses grew at a low-double digit rate due to continued demand for consumables along with an increase in demand for equipment, driven in part by the recovery from lower equipment volumes in 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Core sales in the marking and coding business increased across all major geographies and most major end-markets. Year-over-year core sales in the packaging and color solutions products and services business increased across most major geographies. Operating Profit PerformanceOperating profit margins were flat during 2021 as compared to 2020. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. 2021 vs. 2020 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:•Impairment charges related to a trade name and other intangible assets in the first quarter of 2020 and a trade name in the third quarter of 2020 - 45 basis points2021 vs. 2020 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:•Incremental year-over-year costs associated with sales, service and marketing growth investments and incremental year-over-year material and labor costs, net of higher 2021 core sales volumes, incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with continuing productivity improvement initiatives and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates in 2021 - 45 basis pointsCOST OF SALES AND GROSS PROFIT Year Ended December 31($ in millions)202120202019Sales$29,453 $22,284 $17,911 Cost of sales(11,501)(9,809)(7,927)Gross profit$17,952 $12,475 $9,984 Gross profit margin61.0 %56.0 %55.7 %The year-over-year increase in cost of sales during 2021 as compared with 2020 was due primarily to the impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, including sales volumes from recently acquired businesses and incremental year-over-year material and labor costs. This increase was partially offset by lower incremental year-over-year acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to inventory in connection with acquisitions (the acquisition of Aldevron in 2021 and Cytiva in 2020), which increased cost of sales by $59 million in 2021 and $457 million in 2020.The year-over-year increase in gross profit margin during 2021 as compared with 2020 was due primarily to higher year-over-year sales volumes, including sales volumes from recently acquired businesses and the impact of the change in mix of sales to higher margin product lines. The acquisition-related charges of $76 million incurred in 2021 associated with fair value adjustments to deferred revenue related to the Cytiva Acquisition and fair value adjustments to inventory in connection with the acquisitions of both Aldevron and Cytiva, were lower than the $509 million of fair value adjustments to deferred revenue and inventory recorded in 2020 related to the Cytiva Acquisition, which also contributed to the increased gross profit margin in 2021. Gross profit margin also benefited in 2021 from the inclusion of a full year of Cytiva sales compared to only nine months in 2020. OPERATING EXPENSES Year Ended December 31($ in millions)202120202019Sales$29,453 $22,284 $17,911 Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses(8,198)(6,896)(5,589)Research and development (“R&D”) expenses(1,742)(1,348)(1,126)Other operating expenses(547)— — SG&A as a % of sales27.8 %30.9 %31.2 %R&D as a % of sales5.9 %6.0 %6.3 %Other operating expenses as a % of sales1.9 %— %— %45Table of ContentsSG&A expenses as a percentage of sales declined 310 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2021 compared with 2020. The decline was driven by the benefit of increased leverage of the Company’s general and administrative cost base, including amortization expense, resulting from higher 2021 sales volumes, including sales volumes from recently acquired businesses, incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with continuing productivity improvement initiatives and lower year-over-year impairment charges related to a facility, a trade name and other intangible assets incurred in 2020, net of impairment charges related to a trade name in 2021. The Company’s 2021 transaction costs for the acquisition of Aldevron were lower than 2020 transaction costs for the acquisition of Cytiva, which also benefited SG&A as a percentage of sales during 2021. These decreases were partially offset by continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives in 2021. R&D expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) as a percentage of sales declined slightly in 2021 as compared with 2020, primarily due to the sales growth rate exceeding the spending growth related to new product development initiatives. Other operating expenses and other operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased in 2021 compared with 2020 as a result of the contract settlement expense related to the modification and partial termination of a prior commercial arrangement and resolution of the associated litigation during 2021. Refer to Note 8 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) Nonoperating income (expense) consists primarily of net unrealized and realized gains/losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the Company’s investments in equity securities and investments in partnerships, the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit costs and gains on the sale of product lines. Refer to Note 9 in the Consolidated Financial Statements. LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF BORROWINGSIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company redeemed the €800 million aggregate principal amount of 2.5% senior unsecured notes due 2025 at a redemption price equal to the outstanding principal amount and a make-whole premium as specified in the applicable indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of these borrowings related to the payment of the make-whole premiums and deferred costs in connection with the redemption of $96 million ($73 million after-tax). The Company funded the redemption using available cash balances, including proceeds from the fourth quarter 2021 issuance of the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.8% senior unsecured notes due 2051.In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company redeemed the €800 million aggregate principal amount of 1.7% senior unsecured notes due 2022 at a redemption price equal to the outstanding principal amount and a make-whole premium as specified in the applicable indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of these borrowings of $26 million ($20 million after-tax) related to the payment of make-whole premiums in connection with the redemption. The Company funded the redemption using available cash balances, including proceeds from the fourth quarter 2020 issuance of the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.6% senior unsecured notes due 2050.INTEREST COSTSInterest expense of $238 million for 2021 was $37 million lower than in 2020, due primarily to lower average debt balances in 2021 compared to 2020, partially offset by the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar in 2021 on the interest expense for the Company’s foreign currency denominated debt (and U.S. dollar debt that has been effectively converted into foreign currency through cross-currency swap derivative contracts). Interest income of $11 million for 2021 was $60 million lower than in 2020, due primarily to lower average cash balances in 2021 as a result of the funding of the Cytiva Acquisition in 2020 and the Aldevron Acquisition in 2021 and lower interest rates. For a further description of the Company’s debt and cross-currency swap derivative contracts related to the debt as of December 31, 2021 refer to Notes 14 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. INCOME TAXESGeneralIncome tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.The Company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and 46Table of Contentsexaminations of previously filed tax returns (as further discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, settlements with tax authorities, changes in tax laws and regulations, and legislative policy changes that may result from the OECD’s initiative on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. For a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, refer to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash and Cash Requirements” below.The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and non-U.S. tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis. Based on these reviews, which take into account the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the other factors referenced in the prior paragraph, reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary. For a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.Year-Over-Year Changes in the Tax Provision and Effective Tax RateYear Ended December 31202120202019Effective tax rate from continuing operations16.5 %18.9 %26.4 %The Company’s effective tax rate for 2021 and 2020 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0%, due principally to net discrete benefits related primarily to the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation and audit settlements, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the mix of earnings between the U.S. and certain jurisdictions with lower overall tax rates, net of changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company conducts business globally, and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the U.S. federal, state and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The non-U.S. countries in which the Company has a significant presence include China, Denmark, Germany, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Excluding these jurisdictions, the Company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual non-U.S. country would not have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements given the geographic dispersion of the Company’s taxable income. The Company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various U.S. and non-U.S. taxing authorities. The IRS has completed substantially all of the examinations of the Company’s federal income tax returns through 2015 and is currently examining certain of the Company’s federal income tax returns for 2016 through 2018. In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and various other countries, states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2004 through 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company settled the IRS audits of its federal income tax returns for 2012 through 2015. In the audit, the IRS proposed significant adjustments to the Company’s taxable income of approximately $2.7 billion related to the deferral of tax on certain premium income related to the Company’s self-insurance programs. For income tax purposes, the recognition of certain premium income has been deferred in accordance with U.S. tax laws related to insurance. While the settlement of these matters was not material to the Company’s financial statements, the settlement does not preclude the IRS from proposing similar adjustments in future audits and the IRS has continued to examine the deferral of premium income related to self-insurance programs in its examination of the Company’s federal income tax returns for 2016 through 2018. The examination is ongoing and to date, the IRS has not proposed any adjustments related to the Company’s self-insurance programs. Due to the enactment of the TCJA in 2017 and the resulting reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate for years after 2017, the Company remeasured its deferred tax liabilities related to the temporary differences associated with this deferred premium income from 35.0% to 21.0%. If the IRS proposes adjustments related to the Company’s self-insurance premiums with respect to years prior to the adoption of the TCJA and the Company is unsuccessful in defending its position, any taxes owed to the IRS may be computed under the previous 35.0% statutory tax rate and the Company may be required to remeasure the related deferred tax liabilities from 21.0% to 35.0%, which in addition to any interest due on the amounts assessed, would require a charge to future earnings. Management believes the positions the Company has taken in its U.S. tax returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws. Tax authorities in Denmark have issued tax assessments related to interest accrued by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries for the years 2004 through 2015. During the first quarter of 2021, the Company received a notice from the Danish tax authorities that included a significant reduction in the interest amounts imposed on the original tax assessments. Taking into account the revised interest amounts, the assessments total approximately DKK 2.1 billion including interest accrued to date (approximately $317 million based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2021). The Company’s appeal of the tax assessments with the Danish National Tax Tribunal has been put on hold awaiting the final outcome of other preceding withholding tax cases that have been brought before the Danish High Court. Management believes the positions the Company has taken in Denmark are 47Table of Contentsin accordance with the relevant tax laws and is vigorously defending its positions. The Company intends on pursuing this matter through the Danish High Court should the appeal to the Danish National Tax Tribunal be unsuccessful. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain and could take many years, as a result of the payments the Company has previously made related to these assessments in order to mitigate further interest accruals, the Company does not expect the resolution of this matter will have a future material adverse impact to the Company’s financial statements, including its cash flow and effective tax rate.The Company expects its 2022 effective tax rate to be approximately 20.0% which is higher than the 2021 rate due primarily to the impact of net discrete tax benefits on the 2021 effective tax rate and the geographic mix of earnings anticipated for 2022. Any future legislative changes in the United States and/or potential tax reform in other jurisdictions, could cause the Company’s effective tax rate to differ from this estimate. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to income taxes.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On July 2, 2016, the Company completed the separation of its former Test & Measurement segment, Industrial Technologies segment (excluding the product identification businesses) and retail/commercial petroleum business by distributing to Danaher stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Fortive Corporation (“Fortive”), the entity the Company incorporated to hold such businesses. In 2021, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $86 million related to the release of previously provided reserves associated with uncertain tax positions on certain of the Company’s tax returns which were jointly filed with Fortive entities. These reserves were released due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for those returns. This income tax benefit is included in earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. On December 18, 2019, the Company completed its disposition of its remaining ownership of Envista and as a result, the results of Envista are reported as discontinued operations. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEComprehensive income decreased by $572 million in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily driven by the impact of losses from foreign currency translation adjustments in 2021 compared to gains in 2020, partially offset by higher net earnings and an increase in the income from pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments and cash flow hedge adjustments in 2021 compared to 2020. The Company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of approximately $1.3 billion for 2021 compared to a gain of approximately $2.9 billion for 2020. The Company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit gain of $378 million for 2021 compared to a loss of $147 million for 2020. The Company recorded gains from cash flow hedge adjustments related to the Company’s derivative contracts in 2021 of $247 million compared to losses of $72 million in 2020.FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENTThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices as well as credit risk, each of which could impact its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. The Company also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign exchange risks and interest rate risks. In addition, the Company’s broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its financial statements as a whole.Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. A change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts the fair value of the debt but not the Company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2021, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt by approximately $1.7 billion.As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s variable-rate debt obligations consisted primarily of U.S. dollar and euro-based commercial paper borrowings (refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2021). As a result, the Company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term interest rates. As these shorter duration obligations mature, the Company may issue additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings, to the extent commercial paper markets are available. In 2021, the average annual interest rate associated with the Company’s outstanding commercial 48Table of Contentspaper borrowings was approximately negative 12 basis points. A hypothetical increase of this average by 100 basis points would have increased the Company’s annual interest expense by approximately $20 million.Refer to “Results of Operations—Interest Costs” for discussion of the Company’s cross-currency swap derivative contracts and interest rate swap agreements.Currency Exchange Rate RiskThe Company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than Danaher’s functional currency or the functional currency of its applicable subsidiary. The Company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign operations into U.S. dollars, Danaher’s functional currency. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the Company’s net investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of stockholders’ equity. Currency exchange rates positively impacted 2021 reported sales on a year-over-year basis primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies during the first nine months of 2021, slightly offset by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the fourth quarter of 2021. If the currency exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2021 were to prevail throughout 2022, currency exchange rates would decrease 2022 estimated sales relative to 2021 sales by approximately 1.0%. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies compared to the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2021 would adversely impact the Company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis. Any weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies compared to the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2021 would positively impact the Company’s sales and results of operations.The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this transactional exchange risk, although the Company has used foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps to hedge a portion of its net investments in non-U.S. operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales and net earnings in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, the Company has assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies. A 10% depreciation in major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2021 would have reduced foreign currency-denominated net assets and stockholders’ equity by approximately $1.6 billion. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s hedging of a portion of its net investment in non-U.S. operations. Equity Price RiskThe Company’s investment portfolio from time to time includes publicly-traded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price. As of December 31, 2021, the Company held $88 million of publicly-traded equity securities. Additionally, the Company holds non-marketable equity investments in privately held companies that may be impacted by equity price risks. These non-marketable equity investments are accounted for under the Fair Value Alternative method with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. Volatility in the equity markets or other fair value considerations could affect the value of these investments and require charges or gains to be recognized in earnings. Commodity Price RiskFor a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”Credit RiskThe Company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, receivables from customers and derivatives. The Company places cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.49Table of ContentsIn addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the Company’s customers. The Company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as deemed appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when deemed appropriate.The Company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and typically with high-quality financial institutions, so that exposure at any one institution is limited.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESManagement assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow, cash on hand and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses (including capital expenditures), consummating strategic acquisitions and investments, paying interest and servicing debt, paying dividends, funding restructuring activities and managing its capital structure on a short-term and long-term basis.The Company has relied primarily on borrowings under its commercial paper program to address liquidity requirements that exceed the capacity provided by its operating cash flows and cash on hand, while also accessing the capital markets from time to time including to secure financing for more significant acquisitions. Subject to any limitations that may result from the COVID-19 pandemic or other market disruptions (such as the disruptions in the financial and capital markets that occurred at times in 2020), the Company anticipates following the same approach in the future.Following is an overview of the Company’s cash flows and liquidity for the years ended December 31:Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity($ in millions)202120202019Total operating cash flows provided by continuing operations$8,358 $6,215 $3,657 Cash paid for acquisitions$(10,961)$(20,971)$(331)Payments for additions to property, plant and equipment(1,294)(791)(636)Proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment13 2 13 Payments for purchases of investments(934)(342)(241)Proceeds from sales of investments126 13 — Proceeds from sale of product lines26 826 — All other investing activities37 24 29 Total investing cash used in discontinued operations— — (72)Net cash used in investing activities$(12,987)$(21,239)$(1,238)Proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with stock-based compensation$86 $153 $130 Proceeds from the public offering of common stock, net of issuance costs— 1,729 1,443 Proceeds from the public offering of preferred stock, net of issuance costs— 1,668 1,600 Net proceeds from the sale of Envista Holdings Corporation common stock, net of issuance costs— — 643 Payment of dividends(742)(615)(527)Net proceeds from (repayments of) borrowings (maturities of 90 days or less)2,265 (4,637)2,802 Proceeds from borrowings (maturities longer than 90 days)984 8,670 12,113 Repayments of borrowings (maturities longer than 90 days)(1,186)(5,933)(1,565)Make-whole premiums to redeem borrowings prior to maturity(96)(26)(7)All other financing activities(16)(3)(43)Cash distributions to Envista Holdings Corporation, net— — (224)Net cash provided by financing activities$1,295 $1,006 $16,365 •Operating cash flows from continuing operations increased approximately $2.1 billion, or 34%, during 2021 as compared to 2020, due primarily to higher net earnings from continuing operations (after excluding charges for 50Table of Contentsdepreciation, amortization (including intangible assets and inventory step-up), stock compensation, gain on sale of product lines, unrealized investment gains/losses, loss on the extinguishment of debt and the contract settlement expense in 2021). These increases were partially offset by higher cash used in aggregate for accounts receivables, inventories, trade accounts payable and accrued and prepaid expenses in 2021 compared to the prior year. •Net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of cash paid for acquisitions, capital expenditures and investments, net of proceeds from the sale of investments, and decreased primarily as a result of lower cash paid for acquisitions in 2021 compared to 2020. Refer to Notes 2 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for a discussion of the Company’s acquisitions and investments. •As of December 31, 2021, the Company held approximately $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents.Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities and productivity improvement initiatives, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows.Operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $8.4 billion for 2021, an increase of approximately $2.1 billion, or 34%, as compared to 2020. The year-over-year change in operating cash flows from 2020 to 2021 was primarily attributable to the following factors:•2021 operating cash flows benefited from higher net earnings in 2021 as compared to 2020. •Net earnings for 2021 reflected an increase of approximately $679 million of depreciation, amortization, stock compensation expense, unrealized investment gains/losses, loss on the extinguishment of debt and contract settlement expense as compared to 2020. Amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments. Depreciation expense relates to both the Company’s manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operating-type lease arrangements. Contract settlement expense represents the pretax charge related to the modification and partial termination of a prior commercial arrangement and resolution of the associated litigation. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the contract settlement expense. Depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and contract settlement expense are noncash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows. Cash flows from the gain on sale of product lines and loss on the extinguishment of debt are reflected in cash flows from investing activities while unrealized investment gains/losses impact net earnings without immediately impacting cash flows as the cash flow impact from investments occurs when the invested capital is returned to the Company. •The aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable used $564 million in operating cash flows during 2021, compared to $160 million of operating cash flows used in 2020. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively the Company manages the cash conversion cycle, which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day it pays for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from its customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period.•The aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets, deferred income taxes and accrued expenses and other liabilities used $94 million in operating cash flows during 2021, compared to $739 million provided in 2020. The timing of cash payments for taxes, various employee-related liabilities, customer funding and accrued expenses drove the majority of this change.Investing ActivitiesCash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures, including instruments leased to customers, cash used for investments and cash proceeds from divestitures of businesses or assets.Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $13.0 billion during 2021 compared to approximately $21.2 billion of net cash used in 2020.Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of InvestmentsFor a discussion of the Company’s 2021 and 2020 acquisitions and divestitures refer to “—Overview” and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, in 2021 and 2020, the Company invested $934 million and $342 million, respectively, in non-marketable equity securities and partnerships. 51Table of ContentsCapital ExpendituresCapital expenditures are made primarily for increasing manufacturing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development, improving information technology systems and the manufacture of instruments that are used in operating-type lease arrangements that certain of the Company’s businesses enter into with customers. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $1.3 billion in 2021 and $791 million in 2020. The year-over-year increase in capital spending in 2021 was primarily due to incremental capital expenditures to increase manufacturing capacity for diagnostic testing and biopharma products (including to address increased COVID-19 related demand) as well as incremental capital expenditures as a result of the Cytiva and Aldevron Acquisitions. In 2022, the Company expects to incur higher capital spending than the prior year to increase manufacturing capacity primarily to support customer demand for products related to testing, treatment and vaccine production for COVID-19 and other growth opportunities. The Company estimates capital expenditures in 2022 to be approximately $1.5 billion. During 2021, certain agencies of the U.S. government, including BARDA, agreed to finance an expansion of production capacity related to chromatography, liquid cell culture media, buffers and cell culture powder media and single-use consumables at certain of the Company’s Life Sciences businesses and the development of diagnostics testing technologies and the expansion of testing production capacity at certain of the Company’s Diagnostics businesses. The Company’s businesses may enter into similar agreements in the future. In consideration of this financing the U.S. government has certain rights, including rights with respect to the allocation of certain of the incremental production capacity associated with such expansion and/or rights in intellectual property produced with its financial assistance. The amount awarded pursuant to these grants in 2021 totaled $568 million and will be paid over periods ranging from one to four years. In 2021, the Company received aggregate payments related to government grants of $73 million that offset operating expenses and capital expenditures of $41 million and $32 million, respectively. Financing ActivitiesCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, borrowings under committed credit facilities, issuance and repurchases of common stock, issuance of preferred stock and payments of cash dividends to shareholders. Financing activities provided cash of approximately $1.3 billion during 2021 compared to approximately $1.0 billion of cash provided during 2020. The year-over-year increase in cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to cash provided in 2021 from the issuance of commercial paper used to fund a portion of the Aldevron Acquisition and the issuance of debt securities in the fourth quarter of 2021, partially offset by cash provided by the sale of common and preferred stock and borrowings incurred in 2020 to finance the remaining amounts needed to acquire Cytiva and for general corporate purposes, as well as the issuance of debt securities in the fourth quarter of 2020. Total debt was approximately $22.2 billion and $21.2 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and notes payable and current portion of long-term debt was $8 million and $11 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had the ability to incur approximately $2.2 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under the Company’s $5.0 billion Five-Year Facility which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has classified approximately $2.8 billion of its borrowings outstanding under the U.S. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper program, $699 million of borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Biopharma Notes and $284 million of borrowings outstanding under the Floating Rate 2022 Euronotes as long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company has the intent and ability, as supported by availability under the Five-Year Facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date. As commercial paper obligations mature, the Company may issue additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings, to the extent commercial paper markets are available. Under the Company’s U.S. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper program, the notes are typically issued at a discount from par, generally based on the ratings assigned to the Company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to LIBOR or EURIBOR. Additionally, the Company’s floating rate senior unsecured notes due 2022 pay interest based upon the three-month EURIBOR plus 0.3%. In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced the intent to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. The Company has evaluated the anticipated impact of the transition from LIBOR and does not expect the transition to be material to the Company’s financial position. The U.S. dollar LIBOR-based borrowings will be available to the Company under the Five-Year Facility until 2023, upon the discontinuance of LIBOR. Prior to the discontinuation of LIBOR, the Company expects to amend the Five-Year Facility to replace LIBOR with another reference interest rate. 52Table of ContentsRefer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company’s financing activities and indebtedness, including the Company’s outstanding debt as of December 31, 2021, and the Company’s commercial paper program and Five-Year Facility.Common Stock Offering and MCPS OfferingFor a description of the 2020 Common Stock and MCPS Series B Offerings, refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Shelf Registration StatementThe Company has filed a “well-known seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance. The Company expects to use net proceeds realized by the Company from future securities sales off this shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, including without limitation repayment or refinancing of debt or other corporate obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and/or working capital.Stock Repurchase ProgramPlease see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s stock repurchase program.DividendsThe Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share of Company common stock that was paid on January 28, 2022 to holders of record on December 30, 2021. In addition, the Company declared quarterly cash dividends of $11.875 per MCPS Series A and $12.50 per MCPS Series B that were paid on January 15, 2022 to holders of record as of December 31, 2021. Aggregate 2021 and 2020 cash payments for dividends on Company common stock were $578 million and $500 million, respectively, and aggregate 2021 and 2020 cash payments for the dividends on the Company’s MCPS were $164 million and $115 million, respectively. The year-over-year increase in dividend payments in 2021 primarily relates to dividends paid on the MCPS Series B, which were issued in May 2020, and an increase in the quarterly dividend rate on common stock effective with respect to the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2021.Cash and Cash RequirementsAs of December 31, 2021, the Company held approximately $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were on deposit with financial institutions or invested in highly liquid investment-grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an approximate weighted average annual interest rate of 0.2%. Of the cash and cash equivalents, $353 million was held within the United States and approximately $2.2 billion was held outside of the United States. The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support general corporate purposes, which may include working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments, paying interest and servicing debt, paying taxes and any related interest or penalties, funding its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, paying dividends to shareholders, repurchasing shares of the Company’s common stock and supporting other business needs. The Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, the Company may also borrow under its commercial paper programs (if available) or borrow under the Company’s Five-Year Facility, enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper programs (if available) and/or access the capital markets. The Company also may from time to time seek to access the capital markets to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions. While repatriation of some cash held outside the United States may be restricted by local laws, most of the Company’s foreign cash could be repatriated to the United States. Following enactment of the TCJA and the associated Transition Tax, in general, repatriation of cash to the United States can be completed with no incremental U.S. tax; however, repatriation of cash could subject the Company to non-U.S. taxes on distributions. The cash that the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance non-U.S. operations and investments, including acquisitions. The income taxes, if any, applicable to such earnings including basis differences in our non-U.S. subsidiaries are not readily determinable. As of December 31, 2021, management believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy its cash needs, including its cash needs in the United States.During 2021, the Company contributed $10 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans and $50 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2022, the Company’s cash contribution requirements for its U.S. and its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are forecasted to be approximately $10 million and $48 million, respectively. The ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan’s funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates and other factors.53Table of ContentsContractual and Other ObligationsFor a description of the Company’s debt and lease obligations, commitments, and litigation and contingencies, refer to Notes 10, 14, 17 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Legal ProceedingsRefer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies, and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESManagement’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience, the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments.The Company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period-to-period. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Acquired Intangibles—The Company’s business acquisitions, including the Cytiva and Aldevron acquisitions, typically result in the recognition of goodwill, developed technology and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the Company may incur. The fair values of acquired intangibles are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by the Company. Significant assumptions include the discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results of the acquired business including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), revenue, revenue growth rates, royalty rates and technology obsolescence rates. These assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. The Company engages third-party valuation specialists who review the Company’s critical assumptions and calculations of the fair value of acquired intangible assets in connection with significant acquisitions. In connection with acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized aggregate goodwill of approximately $7.2 billion and intangible assets of approximately $4.0 billion. Refer to Notes 1, 2 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s policies relating to goodwill, acquired intangibles and acquisitions.In performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market-based approach which relies on current trading multiples of forecasted EBITDA for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the Company’s reporting units to calculate an estimated fair value of each reporting unit. In evaluating the estimates derived by the market-based approach, management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had five reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment. Management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units generally decreases as these businesses are integrated into the Company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2021 indicated that in all instances, the fair values of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 175% to approximately 1,200%. To evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this hypothetical 10% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value 54Table of Contentsover carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 145% to approximately 1,100%.The Company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred for finite-lived intangibles requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. These analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues, expenses, market conditions and discount rates related to these assets. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of intangible assets impairment charges recorded during 2021.If actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the Company’s financial statements. Historically, the Company’s estimates of goodwill and intangible assets have been materially correct.Contingent Liabilities—As discussed in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and Notes 8 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). The Company recognizes a liability for any legal contingency or contract settlement expense that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims, the cost of both pending and future claims and the value of the elements in the outcome. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors, including those discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If the reserves established by the Company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s financial statements. Income Taxes—For a description of the Company’s income tax accounting policies, refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. This requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding: (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. Future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial statements. The Company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when, based upon the technical merits, it is “more likely than not” that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. Judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions. The Company re-evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances, including when: (1) a tax audit is completed; (2) applicable tax laws change, including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (3) the applicable statute of limitations expires.In addition, certain of the Company’s tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in Denmark and the United States (refer to “—Results of Operations—Income Taxes” and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws. However, the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in the Company being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact to the Company’s financial statements, including its effective tax rate.An increase of 1.0% in the Company’s 2021 nominal tax rate would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $76 million.Valuation of Investments in Equity Securities—For a description of the Company’s investments in equity securities and partnerships refer to Notes 1, 9 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company invests in publicly-traded securities, non-marketable securities of early-stage companies and equity method investments, including partnerships that invest primarily in early-stage companies. Investments in early-stage companies have significant risks, including uncertainty regarding the investee company’s ability to successfully develop new technologies and services, bring these new technologies and services to market and gain market acceptance, maintain adequate capitalization and access to cash or other forms of liquidity, and retain critical management personnel. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a further discussion of the risks related to investing in early-stage companies. 55Table of ContentsThe Company’s investments in publicly traded securities are measured at fair value based on quotes in active markets. For investments in non-marketable equity securities where the Company does not have influence over the investee, the Company has elected the measurement alternative and records these investments at cost and adjusts the carrying value for impairments and observable price changes with a same or similar security from the same issuer adjusted to reflect the specific rights and preferences of the securities, if applicable. Valuations of non-marketable equity securities are complex and require judgment due to the absence of market prices, lack of liquidity and the risks inherent in early-stage companies. The uncertainty in the process of valuing securities for which a ready market does not exist may cause our estimated values of these securities to differ significantly from the values that would have been derived had a ready market for the securities existed, and those differences could be material.The Company accounts for its investments in the partnerships using the equity method. Accordingly, the investments are initially recorded at cost and adjusted each period for the Company’s share of the partnership’s income or loss and distributions received. The partnerships’ investments are recorded by the partnerships on an estimated fair value basis and pose the same risks and require the same valuation judgments discussed above. As a result, changes in the value of investments in the partnership will have a direct impact on the Company’s earnings. Impairment losses are recognized to reduce the investment’s carrying value to its fair value if there is a decline in fair value below carrying value that is considered to be other-than-temporary. To determine whether there is an other-than-temporary impairment, the Company uses qualitative and quantitative valuation methods.Realized and unrealized gains (losses) for these investments in equity securities and partnerships are recorded in other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. A 10% decrease in the carrying value of the Company’s investments in equity securities and partnerships as of December 31, 2021 would result in a loss of approximately $160 million.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSFor a discussion of the new accounting standards impacting the Company, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.ITEM 7A.

313616,DHR,DANAHER CORP /DE/,2023,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) included in this Annual Report. For a discussion of risks related to the Company’s non-U.S. operations and foreign currency exchange, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”SustainabilityThe Company views sustainability as a fundamental responsibility and a strategic priority. Our sustainability strategy is to help generations of our stakeholders realize life’s potential by innovating products that improve lives and our planet, building the best team, and protecting our environment. This strategy aligns with Danaher’s Shared Purpose and Core Values, as well as key UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) under the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Our sustainability strategy is also informed by and grounded in the feedback we continually solicit from our stakeholders, including our regular sustainability prioritization assessments. Within each of the strategic elements of our sustainability program referenced above, where feasible and appropriate, we seek to quantify our performance and set goals to encourage continuous improvement. Available InformationThe Company maintains an internet website at www.danaher.com. The Company makes available free of charge on the website its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“the Exchange Act”), as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material with, or furnishing such material to, the SEC. Danaher’s internet site and the information contained on or connected to that site are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.16ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. We have identified the risks and uncertainties described below as material, but they are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, economic conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws, regulations or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns including pandemics, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business and financial statements, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, and our stock price.Business and Strategic RisksThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and could in the future continue to adversely impact certain elements of our business and our financial statements.Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19. The global spread of COVID-19 led to unprecedented restrictions on, and disruptions in, business and personal activities, including as a result of preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses, our communities and governments undertook to mitigate the spread. The direct impact of COVID-19 and the preventive measures implemented as a result thereof adversely affected certain elements of our Company (including to a different degree our operations, commercial organizations, supply chains and distribution systems). Please see “Item 7 - MD&A” for a discussion of how COVID-19 impacted our results of operations in 2022. While the direct impact of COVID-19 and many of the preventive measures moderated in 2022, any resurgence of COVID-19 (or the outbreak of any other epidemic or pandemic) or the reinstatement of similar preventive measures in the future could negatively impact the economies and financial markets of the world and our businesses and financial statements.The Company deployed its capabilities, expertise and scale to address critical health needs related to COVID-19, including developing and making available diagnostic tests for the rapid detection of COVID-19 as well as providing critical support to firms developing and producing vaccines and therapies for COVID-19. Please see “Item 7. MD&A” for a discussion of the Company products used in the fight against COVID-19. As COVID-19 and the preventive measures related thereto have moderated, demand for the Company’s COVID-19 related products has moderated as well. The duration and extent of future demand for our products supporting COVID-19 testing and for our products related to developing and producing vaccines and therapies for COVID-19 is uncertain and depends on multiple factors, including the extent to which COVID-19 persists in endemic form. Declines in demand for our COVID-19 related products that are unanticipated in timing or magnitude could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Conditions in the global economy, the particular markets we serve and the financial markets can adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our business is sensitive to general economic conditions. Slower economic growth in the domestic and/or international markets, inflation, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt, volatility in the currency and credit markets, high levels of unemployment or underemployment, labor availability constraints, reduced levels of capital expenditures, changes or anticipation of potential changes in government trade, fiscal, tax and monetary policies, changes in capital requirements for financial institutions, government budget negotiation dynamics, sequestration, austerity measures and other challenges that affect economies of the world have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, the Company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, including having the effect of:•reducing demand for our products and services (in this Annual Report, references to products and services also includes software), limiting the financing available to our customers and suppliers, increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies;•increasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories;•increasing price competition in our served markets; •supply interruptions, delays or cost increases, which can disrupt our ability to produce or deliver our products and/or increase our costs; •increasing the risk of impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, and the risk that we may not be able to fully recover the value of other assets such as real estate and tax assets; 17•increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which, in addition to increasing the risks identified above, could result in preference actions against us; and•adversely impacting market sizes and growth rates.If growth in any key economy of the world or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period, if there is significant deterioration in any such economy or such markets or if economic improvements do not benefit the markets we serve, our business and financial statements can be adversely affected.We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share. Even if we compete effectively, we may be required to reduce the prices we charge.Our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. Because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors; refer to “Item 1. Business—Competition” for additional details. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets, including high-growth markets. Our ability to compete can also be impacted by changing customer preferences and requirements (for example increased demand for products incorporating digital capabilities or more environmentally-friendly products and supplier practices) as well as changes in the way healthcare services are delivered (including the movement of some care from acute to non-acute settings and increased focus on chronic disease management). Cost containment efforts by governments and the private sector, particularly in the healthcare industry, are also resulting in increased emphasis on products that reduce costs and improve efficiency and effectiveness. In addition, significant shifts in industry market share have occurred and may in the future occur in connection with product problems, safety alerts and publications about products, reflecting the competitive significance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems in our industry. Our failure to compete effectively and/or pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our business and financial statements, and our expansion into new markets may result in greater-than-expected risks, liabilities and expenses. In addition, the Company’s competitors and customers have from time to time introduced, and may in the future introduce, private label, generic or low-cost products that compete with the Company’s products at lower price points. New, disruptive technologies may emerge that displace the Company’s existing technologies. Competitors’ products can capture significant market share or lead to a decrease in market prices overall, resulting in an adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial statements.Our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation.We generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis, our offerings will become obsolete over time and our business and financial statements will suffer. Our success depends on several factors, including our ability to:•correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;•allocate our R&D funding to products and services with higher growth prospects;•anticipate and respond to our competitors’ development of new products and services and technological innovations;•differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings and avoid commoditization;•innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets;•obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies before our competitors do;•successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time;•obtain necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope (including with respect to medical device products by demonstrating satisfactory clinical results where applicable as well as achieving third-party reimbursement); and•stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies.18If we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in R&D of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our business and financial statements. Even when we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we often incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. In addition, promising new offerings may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, uncertainty over third-party reimbursement or entrenched patterns of clinical practice. Competitors may also develop after-market services and parts for our products which may detract from our sales.The health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce (and increase the predictability of) costs, which can adversely affect our business and financial statements.The health care industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce (and increase the predictability of) costs, including the following:•Many of our customers, and the end-users to whom our customers supply products, rely on government funding of and reimbursement for healthcare products and services and research activities. The PPACA, health care austerity measures in other countries and other potential healthcare reform changes and government austerity measures have reduced and may further reduce the amount of government funding or reimbursement available to customers or end-users of our products and services and/or the volume of medical procedures using our products and services. For example, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“PAMA”) introduced a multi-year pricing program for services payable under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (“CLFS”) that is designed to bring Medicare allowable amounts in line with the amounts paid by private payors. It is still unclear whether and to what extent these new rates will affect overall pricing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing services, but to the extent our customers conclude that Medicare reimbursement for these services is inadequate, it can in turn adversely impact the prices at which we sell our products. Other countries, as well as some private payors, also control the price of health care products, directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing or coverage limitations, tying reimbursement to outcomes or (in the case of governmental entities) through compulsory licensing or limiting of intellectual property protections. Global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement.•Governmental and private health care providers and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the delivery of healthcare services, centralizing purchasing, limiting the number of vendors that may participate in purchasing programs, forming group purchasing organizations, strategic alliances and integrated health delivery networks and pursuing consolidation to improve their purchasing leverage, using competitive bid processes to procure healthcare products and services and investing in health care practices to increase their control over health care spending. Payors are also seeking to improve price predictability in an effort to mitigate exposure to future price increases.These changes as well as other impacts from market demand, government regulations, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures are changing the way healthcare is delivered, reimbursed and funded and have in the past and could in the future cause participants in the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services, reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products and services from governmental agencies or third-party payors, heighten clinical data requirements, reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services, affect the acceptance rate of new technologies and products and increase our compliance and other costs. In addition, we may be excluded from important market segments or unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us, and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability. All of the factors described above can adversely affect our business and financial statements.Non-U.S. economic, political, legal, compliance, social and business factors can negatively affect our business and financial statements.In 2022 approximately 58% of our sales were derived from customers outside the U.S. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located outside the U.S. Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the U.S. and increase the localization of our products and services, we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the U.S., particularly in the high-growth markets. Our non-U.S. business (and particularly our business in high-growth markets) is subject to risks that include:•public health crises and epidemics, such as COVID-19;19•interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers; •differences in terms of sale, including longer payment terms than are typical in the U.S.;•local product preferences or requirements;•changes in a country’s or region’s political, legal, social, compliance, business or economic conditions, such as the devaluation of particular currencies;•trade protection measures, tariffs, embargoes and import or export restrictions and requirements;•unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws;•capital controls and limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash;•the potential for nationalization of enterprises;•changes in local healthcare delivery, payment and reimbursement policies and programs;•complex data privacy and cybersecurity requirements;•limitations on legal rights and our ability to enforce such rights, including differing protection of intellectual property;•difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;•workforce instability and differing labor or employment regulations;•difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis; •greater uncertainty, risk, expense and delay in commercializing products in certain foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to product and other regulatory approvals; and•remaining uncertainties relating to the impact of the UK’s exit from the EU in 2020. International business risks have in the past and may in the future negatively affect our business and financial statements.In 2022 we generated approximately 13% of our sales from China. Accordingly, political, economic, legal, compliance, social and business conditions in China generally can adversely influence our business and financial statements. Additionally, China’s government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing sector-specific policies, and it maintains control over China’s economic growth through setting monetary policy and determining treatment of particular industries or companies. Further, considerable uncertainty exists regarding the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world’s leading economies, including the U.S. and China. Uncertainty or adverse changes to conditions in China or the policies of China’s government or its laws and regulations can adversely affect the overall economic growth of China, or of the particular industries in which we participate, and can adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our growth can suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve, and visibility into our markets can be limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets can diminish demand for our products and services and adversely affect our business and financial statements. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that have experienced and may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies, and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities. Demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, marketing or promotional programs, new product introductions, the timing of industry trade shows and changes in distributor or customer inventory levels due to distributor or customer management thereof or other factors. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business and financial statements in any given period.20Certain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other third-parties for development, supply and/or marketing of certain products, potential products and technologies, and such collaborative partners or other third-parties could fail to perform sufficiently.For certain of our businesses, success in penetrating target markets depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies. Relying on collaborative relationships is risky because, among other things, our collaborative partners may (1) not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations; (2) fail to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner; (3) be acquired by other companies and terminate our collaborative partnership or become insolvent; (4) compete with us; (5) disagree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship; (6) have insufficient capital resources; (7) fail to comply with applicable laws, regulatory requirements and/or applicable contractual obligations; and (8) terminate or decline to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms, which may require us to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization and/or cancel programs. The realization of any of these risks could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Acquisition, Divestiture and Investment RisksAny inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices, and to make appropriate investments that support our long-term strategy, could negatively impact our business.Our ability to grow revenues, earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies, and to make appropriate investments that support our long-term strategy. We may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past, which could adversely impact our business. Promising acquisitions and investments are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including high valuations, competition among prospective buyers or investors, the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain applicable antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms. In addition, competition for acquisitions and investments has resulted and may result in higher purchase prices. Changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions and investments.Our acquisition of businesses, investments, joint ventures and other strategic relationships can negatively impact our business and financial statements.As part of our business strategy, we acquire businesses, make investments and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course, and we also from time to time complete more significant transactions; refer to “Item 7. MD&A” for additional details. Acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges, including but not limited to the following, any of which can adversely affect our business and our financial statements:•businesses, technologies, services and products that we acquire or invest in have sometimes under-performed relative to our expectations and the price that we paid, failed to perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable or failed to achieve and/or sustain profitability;•we from time to time incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships, which can also cause a deterioration of Danaher’s credit ratings, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense and diminish our future access to the capital markets;•acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships can cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations in any given period, or over the long-term;•pre-closing and post-closing earnings charges can adversely impact our results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period-to-period;•acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships can create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address;•we can experience difficulty in integrating cultures, personnel, operations and financial and other controls and systems and retaining key employees and customers, and former employees of our existing businesses or businesses we acquire sometimes compete with us;•we are not always able to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships;21•we have assumed and may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company’s or investee’s activities; and the realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies can increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations;•in connection with acquisitions and joint ventures, we often enter into post-closing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments, earn-out obligations and indemnification obligations, which can have unpredictable financial results;•as a result of our acquisitions and investments, we have recorded significant goodwill and other assets on our balance sheet and if we are not able to realize the value of these assets, or if the value of our investments declines, we are required to incur impairment charges;•we may have interests that diverge from those of our joint venture partners or other strategic partners or the companies we invest in, and we are not always able to direct or influence the management and operations of the joint venture, other strategic relationship or investee in the manner we believe is most appropriate, exposing us to additional risk; and•investing in or making loans to early-stage companies often entails a high degree of risk, including uncertainty regarding the company’s ability to successfully develop new technologies and services, bring these new technologies and services to market and gain market acceptance, maintain adequate capitalization and access to cash or other forms of liquidity, and retain critical management personnel; we do not always achieve the strategic, technological, financial or commercial benefits we anticipate; we may lose our investment or fail to recoup our loan; or our investment may be illiquid for a greater-than-expected period of time.The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the acquired company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. In addition, we obtain or receive the benefits of representations and warranties insurance in connection with certain acquisitions. There can be no assurance that these indemnification provisions or insurance coverages will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our business and financial statements.We intend to separate our Environmental & Applied Solutions segment to create a publicly-traded company in the fourth quarter of 2023. The proposed transaction may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits.We have announced our intention to separate Danaher’s Environmental & Applied Solutions segment to create a publicly-traded company in the fourth quarter of 2023, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including obtaining final approval from the Danaher Board of Directors, satisfactory completion of financing and receipt of tax opinions, favorable rulings from the Internal Revenue Service and other regulatory approvals (the “EAS Separation”). There can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy the necessary conditions or that we will successfully complete the anticipated separation in our preferred structure, on the anticipated timeline or at all. Unanticipated developments, including possible delays in obtaining various tax rulings or regulatory approvals, uncertainty or declines in the financial markets or other adverse market conditions, changes in the Company’s cash requirements, challenges in establishing the new company’s organizational structure, infrastructure or processes, or adverse business performance could delay or prevent the proposed separation or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable and/or different than expected. Expenses incurred to accomplish the proposed separation may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate. Executing the proposed separation also requires significant time and attention from management, which could distract them from other tasks in operating our business. Even if the transaction is completed, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the separation and there can be no assurance that the separation will yield greater net benefits to Danaher and its shareholders than if such transaction had not occurred. Following the proposed separation, the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companies may not be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the separation not occurred. 22Divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we or our predecessors have disposed of could adversely affect our business and financial statements.We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest, spin-off, split-off or otherwise dispose of businesses for strategic, financial or other reasons. For example, in 2015 Danaher separated and split-off to Danaher shareholders the majority of its former communications business in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction with NetScout Systems, Inc. (the “Communications Disposition”), in 2016 Danaher separated and spun-off to Danaher shareholders its former Test & Measurement segment, Industrial Technologies segment (excluding the product identification businesses) and retail/commercial petroleum business (collectively known as “Fortive Corporation”) (the “Fortive Disposition”), in 2019 Danaher consummated the separation and initial public offering (“IPO”) and subsequent split-off of its Dental segment, known as Envista Holdings Corporation (the “Envista Disposition”), and in 2022 Danaher announced the anticipated EAS Separation. Transactions such as these pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements. For example, divestitures or other dispositions can dilute the Company’s earnings per share, have other adverse financial, tax and accounting impacts and distract management, and disputes can arise with the new owners of the divested/disposed business. In addition, we have retained responsibility for and/or have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we or our predecessors have sold or disposed. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our business or financial statements but there can be no assurance that this favorable pattern will continue.Potential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the Communications Disposition, the Fortive Disposition, the Envista Disposition or the anticipated EAS Separation could adversely affect our business and financial statements.With respect to each of the Communications Disposition, the Fortive Disposition and the Envista Disposition, we entered into a separation agreement and related agreements to govern the separation and related transactions and the relationship between the respective companies going forward (and we expect to enter into similar agreements in connection with the EAS Separation). These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party that can lead to disputes between us and the respective counterparty. If we are required to indemnify any of the other parties under the circumstances set forth in these agreements, we may be subject to substantial liabilities. In addition, with respect to the liabilities for which the other parties have agreed to indemnify us under these agreements, there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against such other parties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of the liabilities, or that such other parties will be able to fully satisfy their respective indemnification obligations. It is also possible that a court could disregard the allocation of assets and liabilities agreed to between Danaher and such other parties and require Danaher to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to such other parties. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business and financial statements.We could incur significant liability if any of the Fortive Disposition, the Envista Disposition or the EAS Separation is determined to be a taxable transaction.We have received opinions from outside tax counsel to the effect that each of the Fortive Disposition and the Envista Disposition qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code, and we anticipate obtaining a similar opinion with respect to the EAS Separation. These opinions rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, our stockholders and we may not be able to rely on the respective opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that any such transactions are taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the respective opinion. If any such transaction is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.Operational RisksSignificant disruptions in, or breaches in security of, our information technology systems or data or violation of data privacy laws can adversely affect our business and financial statements.We rely on information technology systems, some of which are provided and/or managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personal data relating to employees, customers, other business partners and patients), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as receiving and fulfilling orders, billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations). In addition, some of our remote monitoring products and services incorporate software and information technology that house personal data and some products or software we sell to customers connect to our systems for maintenance or other purposes. These systems, products and services (including those we 23acquire through business acquisitions) can be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, human error or malfeasance (including by employees), power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Attacks can also target hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. Security breaches of systems provided or enabled by us, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services, or security breaches of third-party suppliers we rely on to process, store or transmit electronic information, can result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers, patients or suppliers. Like most multinational corporations, our information technology systems and data have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. Unauthorized tampering, adulteration or interference with our products may also adversely affect product functionality and result in loss of data, risk to patient safety and product recalls or field actions. The attacks, breaches, misappropriations and other disruptions and damage described above can interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, result in disclosure of personal data, damage customer, patient, business partner and employee relationships and our reputation and result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy and other laws and increased costs for security and remediation, in each case resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial statements. Our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches. In addition, our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving legal and regulatory standards, evolving customer expectations, changes in the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data and information systems, and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully maintain, enhance and upgrade our systems as necessary to effectively address these requirements. Further, a greater number of our employees have been working remotely since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, which exposes us to greater cybersecurity and data privacy risks.Any inability to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches can result in adverse regulatory and business consequences and litigation. As a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of our business. Please see “Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters” for additional information. For example, entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured patient health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EU member states and other states subject to the GDPR may result in fines of up to €20 million or up to 4% of total worldwide annual turnover for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties. Several other countries such as China and Russia have passed, and other countries have passed or are considering passing, laws that require some or all personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers or impose significant restrictions on data transfer. State privacy laws in California impose some of the same features as the GDPR and have prompted several other states to enact similar laws. Additionally, a bipartisan bill under consideration in Congress would, if adopted, impose broad privacy requirements at the U.S. federal level and provide enhanced enforcement authority to the FTC. Government investigations and enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to customer, patient, business partner and employee relationships and to our reputation, any of which may adversely affect our business and financial statements. In addition, compliance with the varying data privacy regulations across the U.S. and around the world has required significant expenditures and may require additional expenditures, and may require further changes in our products or business models that increase competition or reduce revenue.Defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products or services, or allegations thereof, can adversely affect our business and financial statements.Manufacturing or design defects or “bugs” in, unanticipated use of, safety or quality issues (or the perception of such issues) with respect to, “off label” use of, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell (including items that we source from third-parties) can lead to personal injury, death, property damage and/or regulatory violations that can adversely affect our business and financial statements. These events can lead to recalls or safety alerts, result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us. The accelerated development and production of products and services in an effort to address the COVID-19 pandemic also 24increased the risk of regulatory enforcement actions, product defects or claims thereof. Recalls, removals and product liability and similar claims (regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome) can result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. Our business can also be affected by studies of the utilization, safety and efficacy of medical device products and components that are conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. Any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of product issues, including claims by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class.If we suffer loss to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed.Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, cyber-attack, earthquake, hurricane, power shortage or outage, public health crisis (including epidemics and pandemics) and the reaction thereto, war, terrorism, riot, public protest or other natural or man-made disasters, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the damage caused to our facilities by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017. If any of these facilities, supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, diminish demand, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and significant repair or replacement expenses. The third-party insurance coverage that we maintain varies from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against such losses.Climate change, legal or regulatory measures to address climate change and any inability on our part to address stakeholder expectations relating to climate change may negatively affect us.Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere presents risks to our operations. Physical risk resulting from acute changes (such as hurricane, tornado, wildfire or flooding) or chronic changes (such as droughts, heat waves or sea level changes) in climate patterns can adversely impact our facilities and operations and disrupt our supply chains and distribution systems. Concern over climate change can also result in new or additional legal, regulatory or quasi-regulatory requirements designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment (such as taxation of, or caps on the use of, carbon-based energy). Any such new or additional requirements may increase the costs associated with, or disrupt, sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely affect our business and financial statements. In addition, any failure to adequately address stakeholder expectations with respect to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters may result in the loss of business, adverse reputational impacts, diluted market valuations and challenges in attracting and retaining customers and talented employees. For example, our ability to achieve our current and future ESG goals is uncertain and remains subject to numerous risks, including evolving regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations, our ability to recruit, develop and retain a diverse workforce, the availability of suppliers and other business partners that can meet our ESG expectations, the effects of the organic and inorganic growth of our business, cost considerations and the development and availability of cost-effective technologies or resources that support our goals.The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products, our business and financial statements could suffer.The manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems can arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or components, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and environmental factors, and if not discovered before the product is released to market can result in recalls and product liability exposure. Because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities and other stringent regulations of the FDA and similar agencies regarding the manufacture of certain of our products, an alternative manufacturer is not always available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity. Any of these manufacturing problems could result in adverse impacts to our business and financial statements.Our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of the supplies that we use in, and the labor we need for, our operations.Prices for and availability of the components, raw materials and other commodities we use in our business, as well as for labor, have fluctuated significantly in the past, including during 2022. Please see “Item 1. Business-Materials” for a discussion of the inputs we use in our business, supply chain and labor availability disruptions and constraints our businesses have faced and are facing, and the adverse impacts that we have incurred and may incur relating thereto. The supply chains for our businesses can be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, fluctuations in demand, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities, legislative or regulatory changes, bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons and external events such 25as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, war, terrorist actions and governmental actions (such as trade protectionism). In addition, some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, regulatory requirements, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. In the event of interruptions in the supply, or increases in the cost, of such supplies, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. Sustained interruptions in the supply of, or increase in the cost of, key components, raw materials, other commodities and labor can result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies and adversely affect our business and financial statements. In addition, due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve, the cost-containment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to, when supply and labor prices rise we are not always able to pass along cost increases through higher prices for our products. If we are unable to fully recover higher supply and labor costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions, or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs, our margins and profitability can decline and our business and financial statements can be adversely affected.Our profitability could also be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations, including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality. During a market upturn, suppliers from time to time extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices. Conversely, in order to secure supplies for the production of products, we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors, which can impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. Because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, at times our manufacturing capacity exceeds or falls short of our production requirements. Any or all of these problems can result in the loss of customers or cost inefficiencies, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial statements.Adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition, performance, purchasing patterns or inventory levels of, key distributors and other channel partners can adversely affect our business and financial statements.Certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to or through key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and end-users. Some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products or compete with us directly, and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. Adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners, reduction or discontinuation of their purchases from us or adverse developments in their financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns, can adversely affect our business and financial statements. The levels of inventory maintained by our key distributors and other channel partners, and changes in those levels, also impacts our results of operations in any given period. In addition, the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries can adversely impact our business and financial statements.Our success depends on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences and skill sets.The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industries, particularly in the areas of science and technology, is extremely competitive and expectations from qualified talent in many areas of the labor market have evolved and escalated recently. In addition, in 2022 we faced labor availability constraints and labor cost inflation in certain areas of our business. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, if we cannot retain and motivate highly skilled workers and key leaders representing diverse backgrounds, experiences and skill sets, or if we experience labor disputes, our business and financial statements may be adversely affected. Our restructuring actions can have long-term adverse effects on our business and financial statements.We have implemented significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. These restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities could diminish our resources and competitiveness, and delays or failures in implementing planned restructuring activities may diminish the expected operational or financial benefits from such actions. Any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements.26Intellectual Property RisksIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third-parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights. These risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of intellectual property comparable to the United States.Many of the markets we serve are technology-driven, and as a result intellectual property rights play a significant role in product development and differentiation. We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our business. The intellectual property rights that we obtain, however, are not always sufficiently broad and do not always provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. In addition, the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property do not always prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented, designed-around or becoming subject to compulsory licensing. In some circumstances, enforcement is not available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third-parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage and adequately protect our intellectual property; our failure to detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights each can adversely impact our business and financial statements.These risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of corporate proprietary information, intellectual property, technology and other assets comparable to the United States. The risks we encounter in such countries include but are not limited to the following:•Joint ventures that we participate in can include restrictions that could compromise our control over the intellectual property, technology and proprietary information of the joint venture;•As we expand our operations globally, increasing amounts of our data, intellectual property and technology is used and stored in countries outside the United States, and regulations in certain countries require data to be stored locally. These factors increase the risk that such data, intellectual property and technology could be stolen or otherwise compromised;•Certain of our products have been counterfeited and we may encounter additional and/or increased levels of counterfeiting in the future;•Governmental entities may adopt regulations or other requirements that give them rights to certain of our intellectual property, technology and/or proprietary information, such as through compulsory licensing or ownership restrictions or requirements;•In certain countries, we do not have the same ability to enforce intellectual property rights as we do in the U.S.; •Governmental regulations relating to state secrecy or other topics limit our ability to transfer data or technology out of certain jurisdictions; and•Risks, costs and challenges of operating in a particular jurisdiction can result in a decision to relocate or divert operations to a different jurisdiction, potentially at higher cost.Any of these risks can adversely impact our business and financial statements. Refer to “—International economic, political, legal, compliance, social and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements” for a discussion of additional risks relating to our international operations.Third-parties from time to time claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.From time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation of third parties’ intellectual property and cannot be certain that the conduct of our business does not and will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of others. Disputes or litigations regarding intellectual property can be costly and time-consuming to defend due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property 27litigation. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to critical technology, be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services, be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights, be required to license technology or other intellectual property rights from others, be required to cease marketing, manufacturing or using certain products or be required to redesign, re-engineer or re-brand our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our business and financial statements. Third-party intellectual property rights may also make it more difficult or expensive for us to meet market demand for particular product or design innovations. When we are required to seek licenses under patents or other intellectual property rights of others, we are not always able to acquire these licenses on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.The U.S. government has certain rights with respect to incremental production capacity attributable to, and/or the intellectual property we have developed using government financing. In addition, in times of national emergency the U.S. government could also control our allocation of manufacturing capacity. Certain agencies of the U.S. government, such as the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, have agreed to finance an expansion of production capacity and/or the development of technology at certain of our businesses, and our businesses may enter into similar agreements in the future. In consideration of this financing the U.S. government has certain rights, including rights with respect to the allocation of certain of the incremental production capacity associated with such expansion and/or rights in intellectual property produced with its financial assistance. If the U.S. government exercises its rights with respect to our intellectual property or allocating our production capacity, our business and financial statements could be negatively impacted.In addition, to optimize availability of needed medical and other products in connection with any pandemic or other national emergency, we may elect or governments may require us or our customers to allocate manufacturing capacity (for example, pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act (“DPA”)) in a way that adversely affects our financial condition and results of operations, results in differential treatment of customers and/or adversely affects our reputation and customer relationships. For example, certain of our customers are or have been subject to DPA requirements relating to the production of COVID-19 related products and have required certain of our businesses to also comply with these requirements under our supply agreements. Under such circumstances, the levels of demand for our products can exceed our capacity to meet such demand on a timely basis or at all, which can result in negative publicity, competitive disadvantage and legal liability, and may adversely affect our business and financial statements.Financial and Tax RisksOur outstanding debt has increased significantly as a result of acquisitions, and we may incur additional debt in the future. Our existing and future indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and negatively impact our credit ratings; and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and financial statements.As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $19.7 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we had the ability to incur approximately $3.0 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under our credit facilities that were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances. Our debt level and related debt service obligations (as well as the dividend obligations pursuant to our Series B Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“MCPS”)) can have negative consequences, including (1) requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt (or dividends on our MCPS), which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and other investments; (2) reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and (3) exposing us to interest rate risk on any variable rate debt we may issue. If our credit ratings are downgraded or put on watch for a potential downgrade, we may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in the amounts, at the times or interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if our current credit ratings were maintained.Our credit facilities and long-term debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us, including certain restrictions on our ability to incur liens on our assets, and a requirement under our credit facilities to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus shareholders’ equity) of 0.65 to 1.0 or less. If we breach any of these restrictions and cannot obtain a waiver from the lenders on favorable terms, subject to applicable cure periods, the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which would adversely affect our business and financial statements (including our liquidity). If we add new debt in the future, the risks described above would increase.28We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.As of December 31, 2022, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $60.1 billion. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets, changes in the structure of our business, divestitures, market capitalization declines, or increases in associated discount rates can impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. In the past, we have recognized impairment charges relating to certain non-goodwill intangible assets, and in the future, we could recognize charges related to the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets. Any such impairment charges adversely affect our financial statements in the periods recognized.Foreign currency exchange rates can adversely affect our financial statements.Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our financial statements. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar increases the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which can adversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar adversely affects the cost of materials, products and services we purchase overseas. Sales and expenses of our non-U.S. businesses are also translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar generally results in unfavorable translation effects. In addition, certain of our businesses invoice customers in a currency other than the business’ functional currency, and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency can also result in unfavorable translation effects. The Company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries.Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments can affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities can result in additional tax payments for prior periods.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions. Due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”)), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our intercompany arrangements, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, our estimates of effective tax rate and income tax assets and liabilities can be incorrect and our financial statements could be adversely affected; please refer to “Item 7. MD&A” for a discussion of additional factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period. The impact of the factors referenced in the preceding sentence may be substantially different from period-to-period. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities, such as the audits described in MD&A and the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. If audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our results can be adversely affected. Any further changes to the tax system in the United States or in other jurisdictions could also adversely affect our financial statements. Changes in tax law relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect our tax position.Legislative bodies and government agencies in the U.S. and other countries as well as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) have focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting,” for which the OECD has released several components of its comprehensive plan that have been adopted and expanded by many taxing authorities to address perceived tax abuse and inconsistencies between tax jurisdictions. As a result, the tax laws in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect our business and financial statements.The military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has adversely affected and may further adversely affect our business and financial statements.The military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has adversely affected and may further adversely affect our business and financial statements. In light of the situation in Ukraine, in addition to suspending sales prohibited by sanctions, the Company has suspended the shipment of products to Russia with the exception of products for the purposes of diagnosing and treating patients and producing vaccines and therapeutics. We incurred a pretax charge of $43 million in 2022 as a result of Russia-related asset impairments, accruals for contractual obligations and similar items and we may incur additional charges in the future. In 2021, approximately 1% of the Company’s sales were derived from customers based in Russia and a de minimis percentage of sales were derived from customers based in Ukraine, and in 2022 Russia and Ukraine sales accounted for less than 1% of the Company’s sales. The conflict in Ukraine may escalate and/or expand in scope and the broader consequences of this conflict, which have included and/or may in the future include sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse impacts on energy supplies and prices; potential retaliatory action by the Russian government against companies, 29including the Company, such as nationalization of foreign businesses in Russia. Further, increased tensions between the United States and countries in which we operate cannot be predicted, nor can we predict the conflict’s future impact on the global economy and on our business and financial statements.The Russia and Ukraine conflict also heightens many other risks disclosed in this Annual Report, any of which can adversely affect our business and financial statements. Such risks include, but are not limited to, adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, including increased inflation, constraints on the availability of commodities, supply chain disruption and decreased business spending; disruptions to our or our business partners’ global technology infrastructure, including through cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion; adverse changes in international trade policies and relations; claims, litigation and regulatory enforcement; our ability to implement and execute our business strategy; terrorist activities; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; reputational risk; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets.Our defined benefit pension plans and health care costs are subject to financial and other market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements.Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets, investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates can increase our defined benefit pension plan funding obligations, and upward pressure on the cost of providing health care coverage to current employees and retirees can increase our future funding obligations. Any of these risks can adversely affect our financial statements.Legal, Regulatory, Compliance and Reputational RisksSignificant developments or changes in national laws or policies to protect or promote domestic interests and/or address foreign competition can have an adverse effect on our business and financial statements.Significant developments or changes in national laws or policies to protect or promote domestic interests and/or address foreign competition, including laws and policies in areas such as trade, manufacturing, government purchasing, health care, intellectual property and investment/development, can adversely affect our business and financial statements. For example, certain governments have implemented policies to induce “re-shoring” of supply chains, reduce reliance on imported supplies and promote national production. The Chinese government has issued a series of policies in the past several years to promote the development and use of local medical devices. In addition, in recent years the U.S. has increased tariffs on certain imported goods and trade tensions between the U.S. and China escalated, with each country imposing significant, additional tariffs on a wide range of goods imported from the other country. Our business and financial statements can be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.There can be no assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems, including our Code of Conduct, always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that violate laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, economic and trade sanctions, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct, and violations of such code of conduct could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements.In addition to the environmental, health, safety, health care, medical device, anticorruption, data privacy and other regulations noted elsewhere in this Annual Report, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional levels, including for example the following:•We are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons and dealings between our 30employees and between our subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory. In addition, we sell and provide products and technology to third parties, such as agents, representatives and distributors, who may export such items to end-users. If we or any of these third parties do not comply with applicable export or import laws we may incur liability. In addition, from time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions. These business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations. We have established policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with such laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that the policies and procedures have prevented and will prevent violations of these regulations, and any such violation can adversely affect our business and financial statements.•We also have agreements to sell products and services to government entities (as well as agreements relating to government financing, as discussed above) and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with government entities (less than 5% of our 2022 sales were made to the U.S. federal government). The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. Our agreements with government entities are in some cases subject to termination, reduction or modification at the convenience of the government or in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors, and we may underestimate our costs of performing under the contract. In certain cases, a governmental entity may require us to pay back amounts it has paid to us. Government contracts that have been awarded to us following a bid process can become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder, which could result in loss of the contract. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts. These are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. The regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and can be inconsistent across jurisdictions. We, our representatives and the industries in which we operate are at times under review and/or investigation by regulatory authorities. Failure to comply (or any alleged or perceived failure to comply) with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations can result in import detentions, fines, damages, civil and administrative penalties, injunctions, consent decrees, suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts, disbarment from selling to certain governmental agencies or exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disruption of our business, limitation on our ability to manufacture, import, export and sell products and services, loss of customers, significant legal and investigatory fees, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, reputational harm, contractual damages, diminished profits, curtailment or restricting of business operations, criminal prosecution and other monetary and non-monetary penalties. Compliance with these and other regulations can also affect our returns on investment, require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our business. Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the International Standards Organization, and failure to comply with these rules can result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our business and financial statements. For additional information regarding these risks, refer to “Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters.”We are subject to or otherwise responsible for a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that can adversely affect our business and financial statements.We are subject to or otherwise responsible for a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business (or related to the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims or counterclaims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, breach of contract claims, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage, securities matters, fiduciary duties and acquisition or divestiture-related matters, as well as regulatory subpoenas, requests for information, investigations and enforcement. We also from time to time become subject to lawsuits as a result of acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, businesses divested by us or our predecessors. The types of claims made in lawsuits include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages (and in some cases, treble damages) and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits can divert our management’s attention, we from time to time incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we can be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies 31that adversely affect our business and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, new developments (including litigation developments, the discovery of new facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases), changes in assumptions or changes in the Company’s strategy in any given period can require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments can adversely affect our business and financial statements in any particular period. There can be no assurance that our liabilities in connection with current and future litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and business. However, based on our experience, information and applicable law as of the date of this Annual Report, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2022 will have a material effect on our business or financial statements.From time to time, we become aware through our internal audits and other internal control procedures, employees or other parties of possible compliance matters, such as complaints or concerns relating to accounting, internal controls, financial reporting, auditing or ethical matters or relating to compliance with laws. When we become aware of such possible compliance matters, we investigate internally and take what we believe to be appropriate corrective action. Internal investigations can lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of legal or regulatory proceedings against us and adversely affect our business and financial statements.Certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and by comparable agencies of other countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information. Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the FDA, by other federal and state governmental agencies, by comparable agencies of other countries and regions, by certain accrediting bodies and by regulations governing hazardous materials and drugs-of-abuse (or the manufacture and sale of products containing any such materials). The global health care regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent and unpredictable. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years, and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, their existing regulations. For example, the proposed Verifying Accurate Leading-edge IVCT Development (VALID) Act would give FDA additional authority to regulate in vitro diagnostics, including laboratory-developed tests. Please see “Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters” for more information. Failure to meet these requirements can adversely impact our business and financial statements in the applicable geographies.To varying degrees, these regulators require us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution and post-marketing surveillance of our products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance (such as 510(k) clearance) or approvals for our new products or modifications to (or additional indications or uses of) existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be time-consuming, costly and subject to restrictions. Our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors, for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results, and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained. Even after initial regulatory clearance or approval, we are subject to periodic inspection by these regulatory authorities, and if safety issues arise we can be required to amend conditions for use of a product, such as providing additional warnings on the product’s label or narrowing its approved intended use, which could reduce the product’s market acceptance. We are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse, research and development, pricing and sales and marketing practices, the privacy and security of health information as well as manufacturing and quality standards, including the federal regulations described in “Item 1. Business—Regulatory Matters.” Government authorities may conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law. Failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products (or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products), other violations of laws or regulations, failure to remediate inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products (even after obtaining clearance for distribution) and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to FDA Form 483 Inspectional Observations, warning letters, notices to customers, declining sales, loss of customers, loss of market share, remediation and increased compliance costs, recalls, seizures of adulterated or misbranded products, fines, expenses, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal penalties, consent decrees, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, narrowing of permitted uses for a product, refusal of the government to grant 510(k) clearance, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, pre-market notification rescissions and other adverse effects referenced under the risk factor titled “Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; 32failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements.” Further, defending against any such actions can be costly and time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions brought against us, our business may be impaired. Ensuring that our operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations also involves substantial costs. Our products can be subject to human clinical trials, the results of which may be unexpected, or perceived as unfavorable by the market, and could adversely affect our business and financial statements.As a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for certain new products and new indications for certain existing products, we conduct and participate in clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unexpected or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials, or a regulator’s or market perception of these clinical data, can adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate and our business and financial statements.Off-label marketing of our products could result in substantial penalties.The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about approved or cleared products. In particular, any clearances we may receive only permit us to market our products for the intended uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the FDA. We may request additional label indications for our current products, and the FDA may deny those requests outright, require additional performance or clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance. If the FDA or any other regulator determines that we have marketed our products for off-label use, we can be subject to exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the other adverse effects referenced under the risk factors set forth above. Any of these events could significantly harm our business and financial statements.Certain modifications to our products may require new 510(k) clearances or other marketing authorizations and may require us to recall or cease marketing our products.Once a medical device is permitted to be legally marketed in the United States pursuant to a 510(k) clearance or a premarket approval (“PMA”), a manufacturer may be required to notify the FDA of certain modifications to the device (similar requirements apply in other jurisdictions). Manufacturers determine in the first instance whether a change to a product requires a new 510(k) clearance or premarket submission, but the FDA may review any manufacturer’s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances are necessary. We have made modifications to our products in the past and have determined based on our review of the applicable FDA regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 510(k) clearances or other premarket submissions were not required. We may make similar modifications or add additional features in the future that we believe do not require a new clearance or approval. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations and requires us to submit new 510(k) notifications or PMA applications, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance, and we may be subject to civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation.Our operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Our operations, products and services are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the health and safety of our employees, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials, emissions or discharges of substances into the environment, investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites, chemical constituents in products and end-of-life disposal and take-back programs for products sold. There can be no assurance that our environmental, health and safety compliance program (or the compliance programs of businesses we acquire) have been or will at all times be effective. Failure to comply with any of these laws can result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our business or financial statements.In addition, we from time to time incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury, property damage or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury or damage due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. We can also become subject to additional remedial, compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules. There can be no assurance that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional 33claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. However, based on the information we have as of the date of this Annual Report we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2022, will have a material effect on our business or financial statements.Changes in governmental regulations can reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses.We compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional regulations, such as regulations governing health and safety, the environment, food and drugs and privacy. We develop, configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in any of these regulations (or in the interpretation or application thereof) can reduce demand for, increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services, or restrict our existing activities, products and services. For example, changes in the FDA’s regulation of the drug discovery/development process can have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and services. Exclusive forum provisions in our By-laws could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose their preferred judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.Our Amended and Restated By-laws (the “By-laws”) provide that unless the Company selects or consents to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for any complaint asserting any internal corporate claims, to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, will be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have, or declines to accept, jurisdiction, another state court or a federal court located within the State of Delaware) (collectively, “Delaware Courts”). Current and former stockholders are deemed to have consented to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts in connection with any action to enforce such exclusive forum provision and to service of process in any such action. These provisions of the By-laws are not a waiver of, and do not relieve anyone of duties to comply with, federal securities laws including those specifying the exclusive jurisdiction of federal courts under the Exchange Act and concurrent jurisdiction of federal and state courts under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. To the extent that the exclusive forum provisions of our By-laws limit a current or former stockholder’s ability to select a judicial forum other than the Delaware Courts, they might discourage the specified legal actions, might cause current or former stockholders to incur additional litigation-related expenses and might result in outcomes unfavorable to current or former stockholders. Alternatively, a court might determine that these provisions of the By-laws are inapplicable or unenforceable in any particular action, in which case we may incur additional litigation-related expenses in such action, and the action may result in outcomes unfavorable to us, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial statements.ITEM 1B.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide material information relevant to an assessment of Danaher’s financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources. The MD&A is designed to focus specifically on material events and uncertainties known to management that are reasonably likely to cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or of future financial condition. This includes descriptions and amounts of matters that have had a material impact on reported operations, as well as matters that are reasonably likely based on management’s assessment to have a material impact on future operations. The Company’s MD&A is divided into five sections:•Overview•Results of Operations•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Critical Accounting Estimates•New Accounting StandardsThis discussion and analysis should be read together with Danaher’s audited financial statements and related Notes thereto as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 included in this Annual Report. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for 2020 is included in Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to the year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as supplemented by the discussion herein of the new Biotechnology and Life Sciences segments (which were previously reported together as the former Life Sciences segment), and should be referred to for information regarding this period. Unless otherwise indicated, all financial results in this report refer to continuing operations.OVERVIEWGeneralRefer to “Item 1. Business—General” for a discussion of Danaher’s strategic objectives and methodologies for delivering long-term shareholder value. Danaher is a multinational business with global operations. During 2022, approximately 58% of Danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the United States. As a diversified, global business, Danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors. Danaher’s geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of its products and services, help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. The Company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.As a result of the Company’s geographic and industry diversity, the Company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges, including rapid technological development (particularly with respect to computing, automation, artificial intelligence, mobile connectivity, communications and digitization) in most of the Company’s served markets, the expansion and evolution of opportunities in high-growth markets, trends and costs associated with a global labor force, consolidation of the Company’s competitors and increasing regulation. The Company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and the Company’s long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in high-growth geographies and high-growth market segments, identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions and identify and consummate appropriate investments and strategic partnerships, develop innovative and differentiated new products and services with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of the Company’s sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated global environment. The Company is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions and investments, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources (particularly in high-growth markets) in order to be responsive to the Company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the Company’s operations.Business PerformanceConsolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 7.0% as compared to 2021. Acquisitions contributed 1.5% to the increase in revenues in 2022 and the impact of currency translation decreased reported sales 4.0%. Core sales 37Table of Contentsincreased 9.5% in 2022 compared to 2021 (for the definition of “core sales” refer to “—Results of Operations” below). The Company’s continued investments in sales growth initiatives and the other business-specific factors referenced below contributed to core sales growth. Geographically, both high-growth and developed markets contributed to year-over-year core sales growth during 2022. Core sales in developed markets grew at a low-teens rate in 2022 as compared to 2021 and were driven by North America and Western Europe. Core sales in high-growth markets grew at a low-single digit rate in 2022 as compared to 2021, with broad-based growth across these markets, led by growth in China. High-growth markets represented approximately 29% of the Company’s total sales in 2022. The Company’s net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled approximately $7.2 billion, compared to approximately $6.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net earnings attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled approximately $7.1 billion or $9.66 per diluted common share compared to approximately $6.3 billion or $8.61 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net earnings in 2022 as compared to 2021 was driven by increased sales in the Company’s existing businesses and sales from acquired businesses, by a lower effective tax rate in 2022 driven by discrete tax benefits and by the impact of the non-recurring charge incurred in 2021 related to the modification and partial termination of a prior commercial arrangement and resolution of the associated litigation recorded, partially offset by investment losses recorded in 2022. Refer to “—Results of Operations” for further discussion of the year-over-year changes in net earnings and diluted net earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2022. For a discussion of the impact of supply chain disruptions, labor availability constraints and increased labor costs on our businesses in 2022, please see “Item 1. Business – Materials.” For a discussion of the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our businesses in 2022, please see “Item 1. Business – Russia-Ukraine Conflict.”The COVID-19 PandemicThe global spread of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to unprecedented restrictions on, and disruptions in, business and personal activities, including as a result of preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses, our communities and governments have taken and are taking to mitigate the spread of the virus and to manage its impact. The Company continues to actively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic, including the current spread of certain variants of the virus and plan for potential impacts on its business. The Company has deployed our capabilities, expertise and scale to address the critical health needs related to COVID-19, including developing and making available diagnostic tests for the rapid detection of COVID-19 as well as providing critical support to firms that are developing and producing vaccines and therapies for COVID-19. While the conditions related to the pandemic generally improved in most geographies in 2022 compared to 2021, conditions vary significantly by geography. For example, during the first half of 2022, COVID-19 considerations resulted in the re-imposition of widespread shutdowns and restrictions in China. During the fourth quarter of 2022, China relaxed many of these restrictions and began experiencing increasing COVID-19 related cases resulting in lower patient volumes for elective procedures and wellness visits as hospitals prioritized treating COVID-19 related cases. These higher COVID-19 related cases in China are anticipated to continue at least into the first quarter of 2023. The resulting impact to the Company will depend upon the prevalence of COVID-19 in the impacted regions of China and the resulting impact on economic activity, including demand and production capacity. Demand for the Company’s products that support COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics (including initiatives that seek to prevent or mitigate similar, future pandemics) decreased in 2022 versus 2021. The Company expects overall demand for these products to decrease in 2023 versus 2022. Additionally, demand for the Company’s products that support COVID-19 testing continues to fluctuate significantly driven by increases or decreases in COVID-19 cases in particular geographies. While sales of COVID-19 related testing products increased in 2022 compared to 2021, the Company expects overall demand for these products to decrease in 2023 as the pandemic subsides in most geographies and evolves toward endemic status.Due to the speed with which the COVID-19 situation has evolved, the global breadth of its spread, the range of governmental and community responses thereto and our geographic and business line diversity, its further impact on our business remains highly uncertain, but may be materially negative to certain elements of our business. The potential negative impact will depend on future developments including but not limited to:•the degree of spread and severity of COVID-19 variants and government responses thereto;•the timing and durability of continued recovery in the global demand for our non-COVID-19 related products and services; and•the degree and pace of continuing declines in demand for products supporting COVID-19 testing and for products related to developing and producing vaccines and therapies for COVID-19.38Table of ContentsFor additional information on the risks of COVID-19 to the Company’s operations, refer to the “Item 1A. Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report. Acquisitions During 2022 the Company acquired 10 businesses for total consideration of $637 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company’s four segments. The aggregate annual sales of the 10 businesses acquired in 2022 at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $91 million. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion regarding the Company’s acquisitions. RESULTS OF OPERATIONSIn this report, references to the non-GAAP measures of core sales (also referred to as core revenues or sales/revenues from existing businesses) and core sales including Cytiva refer to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) but excluding:•sales from acquired businesses (as defined below, as applicable); and•the impact of currency translation.References to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less any sales and operating profit, during the applicable period, attributable to divested product lines not considered discontinued operations; provided that in calculating core sales including Cytiva, Cytiva’s sales (net of the sales of the Company product lines divested in 2020 to obtain regulatory approval to acquire Cytiva, or the “divested product lines”) (“Cytiva sales”) are excluded from the definition of sales attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between:•the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses (as defined above, as applicable)); and•the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses (as defined above, as applicable)) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period.As noted above, beginning with results for the second quarter of 2020, the Company also presents core sales on a basis that includes Cytiva sales. Prior to the acquisition of Cytiva, Danaher calculated core sales solely on a basis that excluded sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition. However, given Cytiva’s significant size and historical core sales growth rate, in each case compared to Danaher’s existing businesses, management believes it is appropriate to also present core sales on a basis that includes Cytiva sales. Management believes this presentation provides useful information to investors by demonstrating beginning immediately after the acquisition Cytiva’s impact on the Company’s growth profile, rather than waiting to demonstrate such impact until 12 months after the acquisition when Cytiva would normally have been included in Danaher’s core sales calculation. Danaher calculates period-to-period core sales growth including Cytiva by adding Cytiva sales to core sales for both the baseline and current periods. Beginning in the second quarter of 2021, Cytiva sales are included in core sales, and therefore the measure “core sales including Cytiva” is no longer provided for quarterly periods beginning with the second quarter of 2021.Core sales growth (and the related measure of core sales including Cytiva) should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in Danaher’s business and facilitating comparisons of Danaher’s revenue performance with its performance in prior and future periods and to Danaher’s peers. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures to measure the Company’s operating and financial performance and uses core sales growth (and previously used core sales growth including Cytiva) as one of the performance measures in the Company’s executive short-term cash incentive program. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from these measures because currency translation is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions (other than Cytiva sales, in the case of core sales growth including Cytiva) and divestiture-related items because the nature, size, timing and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period-to-period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.39Table of ContentsThroughout this discussion, references to sales growth or decline refer to the impact of both price and unit sales and references to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies resulting from the ongoing application of DBS.The Company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant (generally relating to the Company’s larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for Danaher in a given period.Sales Growth, Core Sales Growth and Core Sales Growth Including Cytiva 2022 vs. 20212021 vs. 2020Total sales growth (GAAP)7.0 %32.0 %Impact of:Acquisitions/divestitures(1.5)%(7.5)%Currency exchange rates 4.0 %(1.5)%Core sales growth (non-GAAP)9.5 %23.0 %Impact of Cytiva sales growth (net of divested product lines)2.0 %Core sales growth including Cytiva (non-GAAP)25.0 %2022 Sales Compared to 2021Total sales increased 7.0% on a year-over-year basis in 2022 primarily as a result of an increase in core sales resulting from the factors discussed below by segment as well as an increase in sales from acquired businesses. The impact of changes in currency exchange rates decreased reported sales by 4.0% on a year-over-year basis in 2022 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most other major currencies in 2022. Operating Profit PerformanceOperating profit margins were 27.6% for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to 25.3% in 2021. The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.2022 vs. 2021 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:•Third quarter 2021 impact of the modification and partial termination of a prior commercial arrangement and resolution of the associated litigation - 185 basis points•Higher 2022 core sales and the impact of product mix, incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with continuing productivity improvement initiatives, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various new product development and sales, service and marketing growth investments and incremental year-over-year material, transportation and labor costs - 60 basis points •2021 acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and transaction costs deemed significant, in each case related to the acquisition of Aldevron - 20 basis points•2021 acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue related to the acquisition of Cytiva - 15 basis points. 2022 vs. 2021 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:•The incremental dilutive effect in 2022 of acquired businesses, net of product line dispositions which did not qualify as discontinued operations - 30 basis points•2022 impairments of accounts receivable and inventory as well as accruals for contractual obligations in Russia - 15 basis points•Fourth quarter 2022 costs incurred related to the anticipated separation of the Company's Environmental & Applied Solutions business - 5 basis points40Table of ContentsBusiness SegmentsIn the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company realigned its reportable segments to reflect changes in the Company’s internal organization resulting from the rate of growth within certain of the Company’s businesses in the former Life Sciences segment. There were no changes to the Company’s Diagnostics or Environmental & Applied Solutions segments. Prior period amounts have been restated to conform to the revised segment presentation.

This increase was partially offset by lower incremental year-over-year acquisition-related charges associated with fair value adjustments to inventory in connection with the 2021 acquisition of Aldevron, which increased cost of sales by $59 million in 2021.The year-over-year decrease in gross profit margin during 2022 as compared with 2021 was driven by incremental year-over-year costs associated with material, transportation, labor and restructuring and continuing productivity improvement initiatives. In addition, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by a 2022 inventory charge related to reduction of business activities in Russia. Gross profit margins declines were partially offset by increased year-over-year core sales and product mix as well as the impact of acquisition-related charges incurred in 2021. The 2021 acquisition-related charges of $76 million included fair value adjustments to deferred revenue related to the acquisition of Cytiva and fair value adjustments to inventory in connection with the acquisitions of Aldevron and Cytiva. 47Table of ContentsOPERATING EXPENSES Year Ended December 31($ in millions)202220212020Sales$31,471 $29,453 $22,284 Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses(8,516)(8,198)(6,896)Research and development (“R&D”) expenses(1,745)(1,742)(1,348)Other operating expenses— (547)— SG&A as a % of sales27.1 %27.8 %30.9 %R&D as a % of sales5.5 %5.9 %6.0 %Other operating expenses as a % of sales— %1.9 %— %SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales declined 70 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2022 compared with 2021. The decline was driven by the benefit of increased leverage of the Company’s general and administrative cost base, including amortization expense, resulting from higher 2022 sales, including sales volumes from recently acquired businesses, as well as incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with continuing productivity improvement initiatives. The Company’s 2021 transaction costs for the acquisition of Aldevron also benefited the year-over-year comparison of SG&A as a percentage of sales. These decreases were partially offset by continued investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives, increased labor costs and incremental restructuring and continuing productivity improvement costs as well as higher amortization expense. Additionally, the declines were partially offset by charges related to impairments of certain accounts receivable and accrual of contractual obligations incurred in Russia and by an impairment charge related to technology and customer relationships incurred in 2022, net of the impact of an impairment charge related to a trade name in 2021.R&D expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) as a percentage of sales declined in 2022 as compared with 2021, primarily due to the sales growth rate exceeding the spending growth related to new product development initiatives. Other operating expenses and other operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased in 2022 compared with 2021 as a result of the contract settlement expense related to the modification and partial termination of a prior commercial arrangement and resolution of the associated litigation during 2021. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. NONOPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE) Nonoperating income (expense) consists primarily of net unrealized and realized gains/losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the Company’s investments in equity securities and investments in partnerships, the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit costs, gains on the sale of product lines and impairments of equity method investments. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

INCOME TAXESGeneralIncome tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.The Company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as further discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, settlements with tax authorities, changes in tax laws and regulations, and legislative policy changes that may result from the OECD’s initiative on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. For a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, refer to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash and Cash Requirements” below.The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and non-U.S. tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis. Based on these reviews, which take into account the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the other factors referenced in the prior paragraph, reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary. For a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.Year-Over-Year Changes in the Tax Provision and Effective Tax RateYear Ended December 31202220212020Effective tax rate from continuing operations13.1 %16.5 %18.9 %The Company’s effective tax rate for 2022 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% due principally to net deferred tax benefits resulting from legal and operational actions undertaken to realign certain of its businesses, as well as excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation and audit settlements and changes in estimates related to prior year tax filing positions, net of changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2021 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% due principally to net discrete benefits related primarily to the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation and audit settlements and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, net of changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions. The Company conducts business globally and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The non-U.S. countries in which the Company has a significant presence include China, Denmark, Germany, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Excluding these jurisdictions, the Company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual non-U.S. country would not have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements given the geographic dispersion of the Company’s taxable income. The Company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various U.S. and non-U.S. taxing authorities. The IRS has completed substantially all of the examinations of the Company’s federal income tax returns through 2015 and is currently examining certain of the Company’s federal income tax returns for 2016 through 2018. In addition, the Company has subsidiaries in Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and various other countries, states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2004 through 2021. 49Table of ContentsSimilar to the position it took in connection with the audit of the Company’s taxable income for the years 2012 through 2015, in the fourth quarter of 2022, the IRS proposed significant adjustments to the Company’s taxable income for the years 2016 through 2018 with respect to the deferral of tax on certain premium income related to the Company’s self-insurance programs. The settlement of this matter for the 2012 through 2015 audit was not material to the Company’s financial statements but did not preclude the IRS from proposing similar adjustments in future audit periods, as the IRS has with the 2022 assessment. For income tax purposes, the recognition of premium income has been deferred in accordance with U.S. tax laws related to insurance. The IRS is challenging the deferral of premium income for certain types of the Company’s self-insurance policies. The proposed adjustments would increase the Company’s taxable income over the 2016 through 2018 periods by approximately $2.5 billion. Due to the enactment of the TCJA in 2017 and the resulting reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate for years after 2017, the Company remeasured its deferred tax liabilities related to the temporary differences associated with this deferred premium income from 35.0% to 21.0%. If the Company is unsuccessful in defending its position, taxes owed to the IRS may be computed under the previous 35.0% statutory tax rate and the Company may be required to remeasure the related deferred tax liabilities from 21.0% to 35.0%, which in addition to any interest due on the amounts assessed, would require a charge to future earnings. Management believes the positions the Company has taken in its U.S. tax returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and intends to vigorously defend these positions. Tax authorities in Denmark have issued tax assessments related to interest accrued by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries for the years 2004 through 2015. During the first quarter of 2021, the Company received a notice from the Danish tax authorities that included a significant reduction in the interest amounts imposed in the original tax assessments. Taking into account the revised interest amounts, the assessments total approximately DKK 2.1 billion including applicable accrued interest (approximately $298 million based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2022). The Company’s appeal of the tax assessments with the Danish National Tax Tribunal has been put on hold awaiting the final outcome of other preceding withholding tax cases that have been brought before the Danish High Court and the Danish Supreme Court. Management believes the positions the Company has taken in Denmark are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and is vigorously defending its positions. The Company intends on pursuing this matter through the Danish High Court and the Danish Supreme Court should the appeal to the Danish National Tax Tribunal be unsuccessful. While the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain and could take many years, taking into account the payments the Company has previously made related to these assessments in order to mitigate further interest accrual claims, the Company does not expect the resolution of this matter will have a future material adverse impact to the Company’s financial statements, including its cash flow and effective tax rate.The Company expects its 2023 effective tax rate to be approximately 19.5% which is higher than the 2022 rate due primarily to the impact of net discrete tax benefits on the 2022 effective tax rate that are not expected to repeat in 2023 and the geographic mix of earnings anticipated for 2023. Any future legislative changes in the United States and/or potential tax reform in other jurisdictions could cause the Company’s effective tax rate to differ from this estimate. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to income taxes.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL & APPLIED SOLUTIONS SEPARATION Fortive Corporation SeparationOn July 2, 2016, the Company completed the separation of its former Test & Measurement segment, Industrial Technologies segment (excluding the product identification businesses) and retail/commercial petroleum business by distributing to Danaher stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Fortive Corporation (“Fortive”), the entity the Company incorporated to hold such businesses. In 2021, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $86 million related to the release of previously provided reserves associated with uncertain tax positions on certain of the Company’s tax returns which were jointly filed with Fortive entities. These reserves were released due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for those returns. This income tax benefit is included in earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Environmental & Applied Solutions SeparationIn September 2022, the Company announced its intention to spin-off its Environmental & Applied Solutions business into a publicly traded company. The transaction is expected to be tax-free to the Company’s shareholders. The Company is targeting to complete the EAS Separation in the fourth quarter of 2023, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including obtaining final approval from the Danaher Board of Directors, satisfactory completion of financing, receipt of tax opinions, receipt of favorable rulings from the IRS and receipt of other regulatory approvals.Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 50Table of ContentsCOMPREHENSIVE INCOMEComprehensive income decreased by $410 million in 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily driven by the impact of higher losses from foreign currency translation adjustments in 2022 compared to 2021 and a decrease in the income from pension and postretirement plan benefit adjustments and cash flow hedge adjustments in 2022 compared to 2021, partially offset by higher net earnings in 2022 compared to 2021. The Company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of approximately $2.1 billion for 2022 compared to a loss of approximately $1.3 billion for 2021. The Company recorded a pension and postretirement plan benefit gain of $209 million for 2022 compared to a gain of $378 million for 2021. The Company recorded gains from cash flow hedge adjustments related to the Company’s derivative contracts in 2022 of $51 million compared to gains of $247 million in 2021.FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENTThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices as well as credit risk, each of which could impact its Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. The Company also periodically uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign exchange risks and interest rate risks. In addition, the Company’s broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its financial statements as a whole.Interest Rate RiskThe Company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and at times variable-rate debt. A change in interest rates on fixed-rate debt impacts the fair value of the debt but not the Company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2022, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt by approximately $1.5 billion.As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no variable-rate debt obligations, however, the interest rates of the Company’s euro-based commercial paper borrowings are fixed based on short-term market rates at the time of issuance (refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2022). As a result, the Company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term interest rates. As these shorter duration obligations mature, the Company may issue additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings, to the extent commercial paper markets are available. In 2022, the average annual interest rate associated with the Company’s outstanding commercial paper borrowings was approximately 43 basis points. A hypothetical increase of this average by 100 basis points would have increased the Company’s 2022 interest expense by approximately $21 million.Refer to “Results of Operations—Interest Costs” for discussion of the Company’s cross-currency swap derivative contracts and interest rate swap agreements.Currency Exchange Rate RiskThe Company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than Danaher’s functional currency or the functional currency of its applicable subsidiary. The Company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign operations into U.S. dollars, Danaher’s functional currency. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the Company’s net investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of stockholders’ equity. Currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2022 reported sales on a year-over-year basis primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies during 2022. If the currency exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2022 were to prevail throughout 2023, the Company’s 2023 sales would be essentially flat relative to 2022 sales. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies compared to the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2022 would adversely impact the Company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis. Any weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies compared to the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2022 would positively impact the Company’s sales and results of operations.51Table of ContentsThe Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this transactional exchange risk, although the Company has used foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps to hedge a portion of its net investments in non-U.S. operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales and net earnings in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, the Company has assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies. A 10% depreciation in major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2022 would have reduced foreign currency-denominated net assets and stockholders’ equity by approximately $1.7 billion. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s hedging of a portion of its net investment in non-U.S. operations. Equity Price RiskThe Company’s investment portfolio from time to time includes publicly-traded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price. As of December 31, 2022, the Company held $16 million of publicly-traded equity securities, excluding equity-method investments. Additionally, the Company holds non-marketable equity investments in privately held companies that may be impacted by equity price risks. These non-marketable equity investments are accounted for under the Fair Value Alternative method with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. Volatility in the equity markets or other fair value considerations could affect the value of these investments and require losses or gains to be recognized in earnings. Commodity Price RiskFor a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”Credit RiskThe Company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, receivables from customers and derivatives. The Company places cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the Company’s customers. The Company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as deemed appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when deemed appropriate.The Company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and typically with high-quality financial institutions, so that exposure at any one institution is limited.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESManagement assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow, cash on hand and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses (including capital expenditures), consummating strategic acquisitions and investments, paying interest and servicing debt, paying dividends, funding restructuring activities and managing its capital structure on a short-term and long-term basis.The Company has relied primarily on borrowings under its commercial paper program to address liquidity requirements that exceed the capacity provided by its operating cash flows and cash on hand, while also accessing the capital markets from time to time including to secure financing for more significant acquisitions. Subject to any limitations that may result from the COVID-19 pandemic or other market disruptions (such as the disruptions in the financial and capital markets that occurred at times in 2020), the Company anticipates following the same approach in the future.52Table of ContentsOverview of Cash Flows and LiquidityFollowing is an overview of the Company’s cash flows and liquidity for the years ended December 31:($ in millions)202220212020Total operating cash flows provided by continuing operations$8,519 $8,358 $6,215 Cash paid for acquisitions$(637)$(10,961)$(20,971)Payments for additions to property, plant and equipment(1,152)(1,294)(791)Proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment9 13 2 Payments for purchases of investments(523)(934)(342)Proceeds from sales of investments18 126 13 Proceeds from sale of product lines— 26 826 All other investing activities51 37 24 Net cash used in investing activities for continuing operations$(2,234)$(12,987)$(21,239)Proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with stock-based compensation$31 $86 $153 Proceeds from the public offering of common stock, net of issuance costs— — 1,729 Proceeds from the public offering of preferred stock, net of issuance costs— — 1,668 Payment of dividends(818)(742)(615)Net (repayments of) proceeds from borrowings (maturities of 90 days or less)(723)2,265 (4,637)Proceeds from borrowings (maturities longer than 90 days)— 984 8,670 Repayments of borrowings (maturities longer than 90 days)(965)(1,186)(5,933)Make-whole premiums to redeem borrowings prior to maturity— (96)(26)All other financing activities(95)(16)(3)Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities for continuing operations$(2,570)$1,295 $1,006 •Operating cash flows from continuing operations increased $161 million, or 2%, during 2022 as compared to 2021, due primarily to higher net earnings from continuing operations (after excluding charges for depreciation, amortization (including intangible assets and inventory step-up), stock compensation, gain on sale of product lines, unrealized investment gains/losses, loss on the extinguishment of debt and the contract settlement expense in 2021). These increases were partially offset by higher cash used in aggregate for accounts receivables, inventories, trade accounts payable and prepaid and accrued expenses, including deferred taxes, in 2022 compared to the prior year. •Net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures, cash paid for acquisitions and investments, net of proceeds from the sale of investments, and decreased primarily as a result of lower cash paid for acquisitions in 2022 compared to 2021. Refer to Notes 2 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for a discussion of the Company’s acquisitions and investments. •As of December 31, 2022, the Company held approximately $6.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents.Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period-to-period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities and productivity improvement initiatives, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows.Operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $8.5 billion for 2022, an increase of $161 million, or 2%, as compared to 2021. The year-over-year change in operating cash flows from 2021 to 2022 was primarily attributable to the following factors:•2022 operating cash flows benefited from higher net earnings in 2022 as compared to 2021. •Net earnings for 2022 reflected an increase of $160 million of depreciation, amortization, stock compensation expense, unrealized investment gains/losses, net of loss on the extinguishment of debt and contract settlement expense as 53Table of Contentscompared to 2021. Amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments. Depreciation expense relates to both the Company’s manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operating-type lease (“OTL”) arrangements. Contract settlement expense represents the pretax charge related to the modification and partial termination of a prior commercial arrangement and resolution of the associated litigation. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the contract settlement expense. Depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and contract settlement expense are noncash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows. Cash flows from the gain on sale of product lines and loss on the extinguishment of debt are reflected in cash flows from investing activities while unrealized investment gains/losses impact net earnings without immediately impacting cash flows as the cash flow impact from investments occurs when the invested capital is returned to the Company. •The aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable used $958 million in operating cash flows during 2022, compared to $564 million of operating cash flows used in 2021. The amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively the Company manages the cash conversion cycle, which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day it pays for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from its customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period.•The aggregate of prepaid expenses and other assets, deferred income taxes and accrued expenses and other liabilities used $561 million in operating cash flows during 2022, compared to $94 million used in 2021. The timing of cash payments for taxes and the impact of deferred tax benefits and charges, various employee-related liabilities, customer funding and accrued expenses drove the majority of this change.Investing ActivitiesCash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures, including instruments leased to customers, cash used for investments and cash proceeds from divestitures of businesses or assets.Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $2.2 billion during 2022 compared to approximately $13.0 billion of net cash used in 2021.Acquisitions, Divestitures and Sale of InvestmentsFor a discussion of the Company’s 2022 and 2021 acquisitions and divestitures refer to “—Overview” and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, in 2022 and 2021, the Company invested $523 million and $934 million, respectively, in non-marketable equity securities and partnerships. Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures are made primarily for increasing manufacturing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development, improving information technology systems and the manufacture of instruments that are used in OTL arrangements that certain of the Company’s businesses enter into with customers. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $1.2 billion in 2022 and $1.3 billion in 2021. The year-over-year decrease in capital spending in 2022 was primarily due to higher 2021 expenditures related to diagnostic testing capacity and declines in expenditures for instruments used in OTL arrangements, partially offset by incremental capital expenditures at Aldevron and Cytiva. In 2023, the Company expects capital expenditures to be approximately $1.5 billion primarily to increase manufacturing capacity and to support other growth opportunities. During 2021, certain agencies of the U.S. government, including the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, agreed to finance an expansion of production capacity related to chromatography, liquid cell culture media, buffers and cell culture powder media and single-use consumables at certain of the Company’s Biotechnology businesses and the development of diagnostics testing technologies and the expansion of testing production capacity at certain of the Company’s Diagnostics businesses. The Company’s businesses may enter into similar agreements in the future. In consideration of this financing, the U.S. government has certain rights, including rights with respect to the allocation of certain of the incremental production capacity associated with such expansion and/or rights in intellectual property produced with its financial assistance. The amount awarded pursuant to these grants in 2021 totaled $568 million and will be paid over periods ranging from one year to four years. In 2022, the Company received aggregate payments related to the BARDA grants and other government assistance of $137 million that offset operating expenses of $50 million and purchases of property, plant and equipment of $87 million. Property, plant and equipment purchased using funds provided by governments are recorded net of government assistance. 54Table of ContentsFinancing ActivitiesCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, borrowings under committed credit facilities, issuance and repurchases of common stock, issuance of preferred stock and payments of cash dividends to shareholders. Financing activities used cash of approximately $2.6 billion during 2022 compared to approximately $1.3 billion of cash provided during 2021. The year-over-year increase in cash used by financing activities was due primarily to net repayments of borrowings in 2022 compared to net proceeds from borrowings in 2021. Total debt was approximately $19.7 billion and $22.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, including notes payable and current portion of long-term debt was $591 million and $8 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had the ability to incur approximately $3.0 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under the Company’s $5.0 billion Five-Year Facility which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has classified approximately $2.0 billion of its borrowings outstanding under the euro-denominated commercial paper program as long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company has the intent and ability, as supported by availability under the Five-Year Facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date. As commercial paper obligations mature, the Company may issue additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings, to the extent commercial paper markets are available. Under the Company’s U.S. dollar and euro-denominated commercial paper program, the notes are typically issued at a discount from par, generally based on the ratings assigned to the Company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate or Euro Interbank Offer Rate, depending on the applicable currency of the borrowing. Refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company’s financing activities and indebtedness, including the Company’s outstanding debt as of December 31, 2022, and the Company’s commercial paper program and Five-Year Facility.Common Stock Offering and MCPS OfferingFor a description of the 2020 Common Stock and MCPS Offerings, refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Shelf Registration StatementThe Company has filed a “well-known seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance. The Company expects to use net proceeds realized by the Company from future securities sales off this shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, including without limitation repayment or refinancing of debt or other corporate obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and/or working capital.Stock Repurchase ProgramPlease see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s stock repurchase program.DividendsThe Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share of Company common stock that was paid on January 27, 2023 to holders of record on December 30, 2022. In addition, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $12.50 per MCPS Series B that was paid on January 15, 2023 to holders of record as of December 31, 2022. Aggregate 2022 and 2021 cash payments for dividends on Company common stock were $693 million and $578 million, respectively, and aggregate 2022 and 2021 cash payments for the dividends on the Company’s MCPS were $125 million and $164 million, respectively. The year-over-year increase in dividend payments in 2022 primarily relates to an increase in the quarterly dividend rate on common stock effective with respect to the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by lower dividends paid on the MCPS Series A as a result of their conversion into common shares in April 2022.Cash and Cash RequirementsAs of December 31, 2022, the Company held approximately $6.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were on deposit with financial institutions or invested in highly liquid investment-grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an approximate weighted average annual interest rate of 2.09%. Of the cash and cash equivalents, approximately $3.4 billion was held within the United States and approximately $2.6 billion was held outside of the United States. The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support general corporate purposes, which may include working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments, paying interest and servicing debt, paying taxes and any related interest or penalties, 55Table of Contentsfunding its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, paying dividends to shareholders, repurchasing shares of the Company’s common stock and supporting other business needs. The Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, the Company may also borrow under its commercial paper programs (if available) or borrow under the Company’s Five-Year Facility, enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper programs (if available) and/or access the capital markets. The Company also may from time to time seek to access the capital markets to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions. While repatriation of some cash held outside the United States may be restricted by local laws, most of the Company’s foreign cash could be repatriated to the United States. Following enactment of the TCJA and the associated Transition Tax, in general, repatriation of cash to the United States can be completed with no incremental U.S. tax; however, repatriation of cash could subject the Company to non-U.S. taxes on distributions. The cash that the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance non-U.S. operations and investments, including acquisitions. The income taxes, if any, applicable to such earnings including basis differences in our non-U.S. subsidiaries are not readily determinable. As of December 31, 2022, management believes that it has sufficient sources of liquidity to satisfy its cash needs, including its cash needs in the United States.During 2022, the Company contributed $10 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans and $40 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2023, the Company’s cash contribution requirements for its U.S. and its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are forecasted to be approximately $10 million and $35 million, respectively. The ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan’s funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates and other factors.Contractual and Other ObligationsFor a description of the Company’s debt and lease obligations, commitments, and litigation and contingencies, refer to Notes 10, 14, 17 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Legal ProceedingsRefer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies, and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESManagement’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience, the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments.The Company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period-to-period. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Acquired Intangibles—The Company’s business acquisitions, including the Cytiva and Aldevron acquisitions, typically result in the recognition of goodwill, developed technology and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the Company may incur. The fair values of acquired intangibles are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by the Company. Significant assumptions include the discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results of the acquired business including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), revenue, revenue growth rates, royalty rates and technology obsolescence rates. These assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. The Company engages third-party valuation specialists who review the Company’s critical assumptions and calculations of the fair value of acquired intangible assets in connection with significant acquisitions. In connection with acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized aggregate goodwill of $427 million and intangible assets of $218 million. Refer to Notes 1, 2 and 11 to 56Table of Contentsthe Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s policies relating to goodwill, acquired intangibles and acquisitions.In performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market-based approach which relies on current trading multiples of forecasted EBITDA for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the Company’s reporting units to calculate an estimated fair value of each reporting unit. In evaluating the estimates derived by the market-based approach, management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. As a result of the Company’s change to its reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company also changed its reporting units. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had eight reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment. Management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units generally decreases as these businesses are integrated into the Company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth. The Company performed the annual goodwill impairments analysis on both the prior five reporting units (that existed before the change in reportable segments) as well as the Company’s eight reporting units (that resulted from the change in reportable segments). The Company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis and the analysis after the change in the Company’s reporting units in 2022 indicated that in all instances, the fair values of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s eight reporting units as of the testing date ranged from approximately 145% to approximately 565%. In the test of the prior five reporting units, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value for each of the previous reporting units as of the testing date also ranged from approximately 145% to approximately 565%. To evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in both goodwill impairment tests, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values in both tests. Based on this hypothetical 10% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 120% to approximately 500%.The Company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred for finite-lived intangibles requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. These analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues, expenses, market conditions and discount rates related to these assets. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of intangible assets impairment charges recorded during 2022.If actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the Company’s financial statements. Contingent Liabilities—As discussed in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and Notes 8 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). The Company recognizes a liability for any legal contingency or contract settlement expense that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims, the cost of both pending and future claims and the value of the elements in the outcome. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors, including those discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If the reserves established by the Company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s financial statements. Income Taxes—For a description of the Company’s income tax accounting policies, refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that 57Table of Contentssome or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. This requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding: (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. Future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial statements. The Company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when, based upon the technical merits, it is “more likely than not” that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. Judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions. The Company re-evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances, including when: (1) a tax audit is completed; (2) applicable tax laws change, including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (3) the applicable statute of limitations expires.In addition, certain of the Company’s tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in Denmark and the United States (refer to “—Results of Operations—Income Taxes” and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws. However, the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in the Company being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact to the Company’s financial statements, including its effective tax rate.An increase of 1.0% in the Company’s 2022 nominal tax rate would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 of $83 million.Valuation of Investments in Equity Securities—For a description of the Company’s investments in equity securities and partnerships refer to Notes 1, 9 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company invests in publicly-traded securities, non-marketable securities of early-stage companies and equity method investments, including partnerships that invest primarily in early-stage companies. Investments in early-stage companies have significant risks, including uncertainty regarding the investee company’s ability to successfully develop new technologies and services, bring these new technologies and services to market and gain market acceptance, maintain adequate capitalization and access to cash or other forms of liquidity, and retain critical management personnel. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a further discussion of the risks related to investing in early-stage companies. The Company’s investments in publicly traded securities are measured at fair value based on quotes in active markets. For investments in non-marketable equity securities where the Company does not have influence over the investee, the Company has elected the measurement alternative and records these investments at cost and adjusts the carrying value for impairments and observable price changes with a same or similar security from the same issuer adjusted to reflect the specific rights and preferences of the securities, if applicable. Valuations of non-marketable equity securities are complex and require judgment due to the absence of market prices, lack of liquidity and the risks inherent in early-stage companies. The uncertainty in the process of valuing securities for which a ready market does not exist may cause our estimated values of these securities to differ significantly from the values that would have been derived had a ready market for the securities existed, and those differences could be material.The Company accounts for its investments in the partnerships using the equity method. Accordingly, the investments are initially recorded at cost and adjusted each period for the Company’s share of the partnership’s income or loss and distributions received. The partnerships’ investments are recorded by the partnerships on an estimated fair value basis and pose the same risks and require the same valuation judgments discussed above. As a result, changes in the value of investments in the partnership will have a direct impact on the Company’s earnings. Impairment losses are recognized to reduce the investment’s carrying value to its fair value if there is a decline in fair value below carrying value that is considered to be other-than-temporary. To determine whether there is an other-than-temporary impairment, the Company uses qualitative and quantitative valuation methods.Realized and unrealized gains and losses for these investments in equity securities and partnerships are recorded in other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. A 10% decrease in the carrying value of the Company’s investments in equity securities and partnerships as of December 31, 2022 would result in a loss of approximately $180 million.NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDSFor a discussion of the new accounting standards impacting the Company, refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.ITEM 7A.

313616,DHR,DANAHER CORP /DE/,2003,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements. 10 Table of Contents Overview Danaher Corporation designs, manufactures and markets industrial and consumer products with strong brand names, proprietary technology and major market positions in two business segments: Process/Environmental Controls and Tools and Components. The Process/Environmental Controls segment is a leading producer of environmental products, including water quality analytical instrumentation and leak detection systems for underground fuel storage tanks; retail petroleum automation products; compact professional electronic test tools; product identification equipment and consumables; and motion, position, speed, temperature, pressure, level, flow, particulate and power reliability and quality control and safety devices. In its Tools and Components Segment, the Company is a leading producer and distributor of general purpose mechanics’ hand tools and automotive specialty tools, as well as of toolboxes and storage devices, diesel engine retarders, wheel service equipment, drill chucks, and hardware and components for the power generation and transmission industries. Management believes that the Company’s future sales growth will come from both core organic growth and acquisitions. The Company invests significant resources in its organic growth initiatives across its business units. Additionally, the Company has completed numerous acquisitions and expects new acquisitions to provide revenue growth in the future. During 2003, the Company expects its primary served markets to remain essentially flat, with the majority of its revenue growth coming from market share gains and geographic expansion. Results of Operations Summary Of Sales By Business Segment. 2002 2001 2000 (in thousands) Process/Environmental Controls $ 3,385,154 74.0 % $ 2,616,797 69.2 % $ 2,441,986 64.6 % Tools and Components 1,192,078 26.0 % 1,165,647 30.8 % 1,335,791 35.4 % $ 4,577,232 100.0 % $ 3,782,444 100.0 % $ 3,777,777 100.0 % PROCESS/ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS The Process/Environmental Controls segment is comprised of Hach Company, the Dr. Bruno Lange Group, Videojet Technologies, Fluke Corporation, Fluke Networks, Gilbarco, Veeder-Root Company, the Danaher Industrial Controls Group, the Danaher Motion Group (including General Purpose Systems, Linear Motion Systems and the Specialty Motors Division), Gems Sensors, Danaher Power Solutions, QualiTROL Corporation, and the aerospace and defense businesses of Pacific Scientific and Kollmorgen Corporation. These companies produce and sell compact, professional electronic test tools; product identification equipment and consumables; retail petroleum automation products; underground storage tank leak detection systems; motion, position, speed, temperature, and level instruments and sensing devices; power switches and controls; communication line products; power protection products; liquid flow and quality measuring devices; quality assurance products and systems; safety devices; and electronic and mechanical counting and controlling devices. 2002 COMPARED TO 2001 Sales of the Process/Environmental Controls segment increased 29% in 2002 compared to 2001. The acquisitions in February 2002 of Gilbarco and Videojet Technologies as well as several smaller 2001 and 2002 acquisitions provided a 36% increase in segment sales. This increase was offset by an 8% unit volume decline in existing businesses. A favorable currency translation impact provided a 1% revenue increase, and prices were essentially flat compared to 2001. Revenues from the Company’s environmental business, representing approximately 30% of segment revenue, increased over 90% in 2002 compared to 2001, resulting primarily from the acquisitions of Gilbarco and Viridor in February 2002 and two smaller acquisitions completed in 2002 and 2001. Acquisitions provided the entirety of this growth, as core operations declined approximately 2%. Modest growth in the Company’s water quality business units was offset by weakness in demand for ultrapure instrumentation, brought on primarily by weakness in semiconductor end markets, and in Veeder-Root’s leak detection market. The Company believes geopolitical uncertainties in oil-producing regions contributed to the decline in demand in the end markets served by the Gilbarco/Veeder-Root business in 2002. Electronic test revenues, representing approximately 20% of segment revenues, grew 6% during 2002, also due to acquisition activity. Acquisitions contributed 11% of this growth, which was offset by a core volume decline of 5%, resulting from weakness in both industrial and network test equipment sales. Sales in the Company’s motion businesses, representing approximately 20% of segment revenues, declined 3%, as a core volume decline of 9% was offset by acquisition growth of 6%. Continued softness in semiconductor and electronic assembly end market demand was a leading factor in motion’s core volume decline. 11 Table of Contents Aerospace and defense revenues increased 7% in 2002, resulting from acquisition activity of 5% and core volume growth of 2%. Power quality sales declined 28% in 2002, due to a significant decline in end user demand that began in early 2001 and has continued through 2002. Sales of the Company’s industrial controls product lines fell 7% due to recession-related weakness in their served end markets. In February 2002, the Company established its product identification business with the acquisition of Videojet Technologies, which accounted for approximately 11% of the segment’s growth during 2002. Operating profit margins for the segment were 16.0% in 2002 compared to 14.9% in 2001. Excluding the impact of the 2001 restructuring program from both 2002 and 2001, margins decreased 0.7 points from 16.5% in 2001 to 15.8% in 2002. Approximately 130 basis points of the change in operating margin resulted from the dilutive impact of lower operating margins of the new businesses acquired during 2001 and 2002. Additionally, margin declines from lower sales volumes at the business units described above, and increases in expenditures on growth opportunities in the segment, were offset by the cessation of goodwill amortization as of January 1, 2002, and other cost reductions including the partial benefit of the 2001 restructuring actions. 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 Sales in 2001 were 7% higher than in 2000 for this segment. The full-year impact of the 2000 acquisitions of American Precision Industries, Kollmorgen Corporation, Warner Electric Motion and acquisitions of several smaller businesses in 2001 provided a 15% increase from 2000. Two small product line dispositions in 2001 caused a 2% decrease in 2001 segment sales. The remainder of the sales change was generated by a decrease in unit volume of 5% and a 1% negative currency translation impact. Overall segment prices remained flat for 2001 compared to 2000. Revenues from the motion business grew approximately 20% from 2000 levels. An increase of 40% from acquisitions was offset by declines in revenues from existing businesses of approximately 20%, driven by recession-related weakness in end markets, particularly semiconductor end markets. Electronic test revenues declined 1.5%. Acquisition growth of 3.5% and continued growth in sales of Fluke Networks business were offset by declines in sales of Fluke industrial products. Environmental revenues for 2001 increased 17% from 2000. 7% of this growth resulted from acquisitions, with the balance coming from core growth in the Veeder-Root and water quality product lines. The Company’s aerospace and defense business units grew 39% in 2001. Acquisition growth of 30%, in particular that provided by the full-year impact of the Kollmorgen acquisition, accounted for most of the increase. Power quality revenues declined 14% in 2001, as net acquisition growth of 6% offset significant declines in end-user demand. Operating profit margins, excluding the effects of the restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001, increased from 15.7% to 16.5% due to aggressive cost reduction actions across all business units and continued margin improvements in recently acquired companies. TOOLS AND COMPONENTS The Tools and Components Segment is comprised of the Danaher Hand Tool Group (including the Special Markets, Asian Tools, Professional Tools and Matco Tools Divisions), Jacobs Chuck Manufacturing Company, Delta Consolidated Industries, Jacobs Vehicle Systems, Hennessy Industries, and the hardware and electrical apparatus lines of Joslyn Manufacturing Company. This segment is one of the largest domestic producers and distributors of general purpose and specialty mechanics’ hand tools. Other products manufactured by these companies include toolboxes and storage devices; diesel engine retarders; wheel service equipment; drill chucks; custom-designed headed tools and components; hardware and components for the power generation and transmission industries; and high-quality precision socket screws, fasteners, and miniature precision parts. 2002 COMPARED TO 2001 Revenues in the Tools and Components segment grew 2% in 2002. The entirety of this growth represents core sales volume growth, as there were no acquisitions in this segment during 2001 and 2002, and price and currency impacts were negligible. Hand tool revenues, representing approximately 65% of segment sales, grew 2%, generated primarily by increases in the Matco sales channel as a result of continued market share gains. Additionally, hand tool revenues in the Company’s Asian channels grew, but were offset by declines in domestic retail channels. Sales of diesel engine retarders at the Jacobs Vehicle Systems business unit increased significantly, as OEM customers accelerated their 2002 order rates to meet a regulatory deadline. Diesel engine retarder demand declined sharply following passage of the regulatory deadline in October 2002, and is expected to negatively impact engine retarder revenues during 2003. Increases in this segment in 2002 were offset by declines in the Delta and Jacobs Chuck business units. Operating profit margins for the segment were 15.2% in 2002 compared to 11.3% in 2001. Excluding the impact of the 2001 restructuring program from both 2002 and 2001, margins increased 1.6 points from 13.5% in 2001 to 15.1% in 2002. This increase resulted from the effect of higher revenue levels, the cessation of goodwill amortization as of January 1, 2002, and other cost reductions including the partial benefit of the 2001 restructuring actions. 12 Table of Contents 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 Sales declined 13% from 2000 to 2001. Continued weakness in the heavy-duty truck market significantly impacted sales of diesel engine retarders, accounting for a 4% drop in segment revenues. Sharp declines in drill chuck sales combined with a fall in hand tool revenues to contribute a 6% reduction in segment sales from 2000. Sales in both the Joslyn hardware and electrical apparatus lines and the Delta Industries product lines reflected double-digit declines from the sales levels achieved by those lines in 2000 due to recessionary pressures in the markets they serve. Price and currency impacts were negligible for this segment. Operating profit margins, excluding the effects of the restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001, decreased from 14.2% to 13.5%. The unfavorable impact of lower production volumes was partially offset by aggressive cost reduction actions taken across all business units. GROSS PROFIT Gross profit margin for 2002 was 39.0%, an increase of 0.8 points compared to 38.2% in 2001. This increase resulted from the benefits of the 2001 restructuring program and other improvements in the gross margins of core business units, in addition to the effect of slightly higher gross margins of newly acquired businesses. Gross profit margin in 2001 was 38.2%, a 0.5% decrease compared to 38.7% achieved in 2000. Lower core volume and lower margins associated with businesses acquired in 2000 and 2001 drove the reduction, and were partially offset by overhead cost reductions and process improvements in all business units. OPERATING EXPENSES In 2002, selling, general and administrative expenses were 23.8% of sales, an increase of 0.7 points from 2001 levels. This increase is due primarily to the effect of newly acquired businesses and their higher relative cost structures, offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization effective January 1, 2002. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2001 as a percentage of sales were 23.1%, 1 point lower than in 2000. Aggressive cost reductions and reductions in discretionary spending implemented in late 2000 and throughout 2001 drove this decrease. RESTRUCTURING CHARGE In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $69.7 million ($43.5 million after tax, or $0.29 per share). During the fourth quarter of 2001, management determined that it would restructure certain of its product lines, principally its drill chuck, power quality and industrial controls divisions, to improve financial performance. The primary objective of the restructuring plan was to reduce operating costs by consolidating, eliminating and/or downsizing existing operating locations. No significant product lines have been discontinued. Severance costs for the termination of approximately 1,100 employees was estimated at $49 million. These employees include all classes of employees, including hourly direct, indirect salaried and management personnel, at the affected facilities. Approximately $16 million of the charge was to provide for impaired assets associated with the closure of 16 manufacturing and distribution facilities in North America and Europe. The assets impaired were principally equipment and leasehold improvements associated with the facilities to be closed. The remainder of the charge was for other exit costs including lease termination costs. Approximately $25.5 million of the $69.7 million charge related to the Tools and Components segments and approximately $44.2 million of the charge related to the Process/Environmental Controls segment. A table describing the application of the restructuring accrual is included in Note 3 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The expected annual pre-tax cost reduction, net of increased costs at other facilities, from the restructuring is approximately $38 million of which approximately 50% has been realized in 2002 with the full year benefit to be realized in 2003. These net cost reductions will primarily reduce the cost of goods sold in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. As of December 31, 2002, the restructuring program has been substantially completed as planned. While certain estimates are required in determining the net amount of cost savings achieved, based on the Company’s analysis of the impact of the restructuring, management believes these net costs savings have been realized. Due to minor changes to the original restructuring plan and to costs incurred being less than estimated, in December 2002, the Company adjusted its restructuring reserves accrued as part of the fourth quarter 2001 restructuring charge by approximately $6.3 million ($4.1 million after tax, or $0.03 per share). In conjunction with the closing of the facilities, approximately $4 million of inventory was written off in the fourth quarter of 2001 as unusable in future operating locations. This inventory consisted principally of component parts and raw materials, which were either redundant to inventory at the 13 Table of Contents facilities being merged and/or were not economically feasible to relocate since the inventory was purchased to operate on equipment and tooling which was not being relocated. The inventory write-off was included in Cost of Sales in the fourth quarter of 2001 and was not part of the restructuring charge. INTEREST COSTS AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS The Company’s debt financing as of December 31, 2002 was composed primarily of $542 million of zero coupon convertible notes due 2021 (“LYONs”), $315 million of 6.25% Eurobond notes due 2005 and $250 million of 6% notes due 2008. The Company maintains uncommitted lines and a revolving $500 million senior unsecured credit facility available for general corporate purposes. There have been no borrowings under the revolving credit facility since it was established in June 2001. Borrowings under the revolving credit agreement bear interest of Eurocurrency rate plus .21% to .70%, depending on the Company’s current debt rating. The credit facility has a fixed five year term. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Company’s uncommitted lines of credit as of December 31, 2002. Net interest expense of $43.7 million in 2002 was $17.9 million higher than 2001. Returns on invested cash balances fell significantly, as general short-term market interest rates declined substantially throughout 2002. Interest income of $10.3 million and $22.4 million was recognized in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net interest expense in 2001 was $3.5 million lower than in 2000 due to an increase in interest earned as a result of higher average invested cash balances during 2001. INCOME TAXES The 2002 effective tax rate of 34.0% is 3.5% lower than the 2001 effective rate, mainly due to the effect of adopting SFAS No. 142 and its resulting cessation of goodwill amortization, and also due to a higher proportion of foreign earnings in 2002 compared to 2001. In connection with the completion of a federal income tax audit, the Company adjusted certain income tax related reserves established related to the sale of a previously discontinued operation and recorded a $30 million credit to its fourth quarter 2002 income statement. This credit has been classified separately below net earnings from continuing operations since the tax reserves related to a previously discontinued operation. The 2001 effective tax rate of 37.5% is 0.5% lower than in 2000, driven primarily by a higher proportion of foreign earnings in 2001 compared to 2000. INFLATION The effect of inflation on the Company’s operations has been minimal in 2002, 2001 and 2000. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company manages its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. The fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates. The value of this debt is subject to change as a result of movements in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to evaluate this potential impact. Based on a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis-point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2002, the market value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt would decrease by $15 million. This methodology has certain limitations, and these hypothetical gains or losses would not be reflected in the Company’s results of operations or financial conditions under current accounting principles. In January 2002, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the 6% notes due 2008 having a notional principal amount of $100 million whereby the effective interest rate on $100 million of these notes will be the six month LIBOR rate plus approximately 0.425%. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended, the Company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges. Since these instruments qualify as “effective” or “perfect” hedges, they will have no impact on net income or stockholders’ equity. See Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The Company has a number of manufacturing sites throughout the world and sells its products in more than 30 countries. As a result, it is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the United States dollar and against the currencies of countries in which it manufactures and sells products and services. The Company’s issuance of Eurobond notes in 2000 provides an offset to a portion of the Company’s European net asset position. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its investment in foreign operations without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. 14 Table of Contents Other than the above noted swap arrangements, there were no material derivative instrument transactions during any of the periods presented. Additionally, the Company does not have significant commodity contracts or derivatives. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position, with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing the capital structure on a short- and long-term basis. Being a key source of the Company’s liquidity, operating cash flow grew $101.9 million to $710.3 million in 2002, or 16.7% during 2002 as compared to 2001. The increase in operating cash flow in 2002 over 2001 was primarily the result of higher earnings and improved working capital management. Improvements were achieved in each working capital component during 2002, driven by Danaher Business System efforts to improve asset turnover. Gross capital spending of $65.4 million for 2002 decreased $19.0 million from 2001, as increased capital spending from new acquisitions was more than offset by declines in core businesses. Capital expenditures are a significant use of funds and are made primarily for machinery, equipment and the improvement of facilities. In 2003, the Company expects capital spending of approximately $100 million. Disposals of fixed assets yielded $26.5 million of cash proceeds for 2002, primarily due to the sale of six facilities in 2002. A net after-tax gain of $3.9 million, approximately $.02 per share, was recorded on the facility sales and is included as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing, and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Company also measures its free cash flow. Free cash flow for 2002, which is defined as operating cash flow of $710 million less capital expenditures of $65 million, grew to a record $645 million, an increase of 23% from 2001. Free cash flow for 2001 is defined as operating cash flow of $608 million less capital expenditures of $84 million. Free cash flow provides a measurement of the cash flows from operations available for purposes other than ongoing capital expenditures. Investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, used cash of $1,145 million compared to $488 million of cash used in 2001. As discussed below, the Company has completed numerous acquisitions of existing businesses during the year ended December 31, 2002 as well as the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. All of the acquisitions during this time period have been accounted for as purchases and have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Company’s financial statements. This goodwill typically arises because the purchase prices for these targets reflect the competitive nature of the process by which we acquired the targets and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these targets bring to existing operations. On October 18, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Thomson Industries, Inc. in a stock and asset acquisition, for approximately $147 million in cash including transaction costs (net of $2 million of acquired cash), an agreement to pay $15 million over the next 6 years, and an additional maximum contingent consideration of up to $60 million cash based on the future performance of Thomson through December 31, 2005. On February 25, 2002, the Company completed the divestiture of API Heat Transfer, Inc. to an affiliate of Madison Capital Partners for approximately $63 million (including $53 million in net cash and a note receivable in the principal amount of $10 million), less certain liabilities of API Heat Transfer, Inc. paid by the Company at closing and subsequent to closing. On February 5, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Marconi Data Systems, formerly known as Videojet Technologies, from Marconi plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $400 million in cash including transaction costs. On February 4, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Viridor Instrumentation Limited from the Pennon Group plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $137 million in cash including transaction costs. On February 1, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Marconi Commerce Systems, formerly known as Gilbarco, from Marconi plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $309 million in cash including transaction costs (net of $17 million of acquired cash). In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company acquired 8 smaller companies, for total consideration of approximately $166 million in cash including transaction costs. On January 2, 2001, the Company acquired 100% of the assets of United Power Corporation for approximately $108 million in cash including transaction costs. The Company acquired 11 smaller companies during 2001 for total cash consideration of approximately $343 million including transaction costs. The Company also disposed of two small product lines during 2001, yielding cash proceeds of approximately $33 million. On July 3, 2000, the Company acquired 100% of the assets of the motion businesses of Warner Electric Corporation for approximately $147 million cash including transaction costs. On June 20, 2000, the Company acquired 100% of the common stock of Kollmorgen Corporation for approximately $267 million cash including transaction costs. The Company also assumed debt with a fair market value of approximately $95 million in connection with this acquisition. On March 27, 2000, the Company acquired 100% of the common stock of American Precision Industries for approximately $186 million cash including transaction costs. The Company also assumed debt with a fair market value of approximately $60 million in connection with this acquisition. The Company acquired 5 smaller companies during 2000 for total cash 15 Table of Contents consideration of approximately $109 million including transaction costs. Financing activities generated cash of $516 million in 2002 compared to $410 million in 2001. In March 2002, the Company completed the issuance of 6.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock. Proceeds of the common stock issuance, net of the related expenses, were approximately $467 million. The Company has used the proceeds to repay approximately $230 million of short-term borrowings incurred in the first quarter of 2002 related to the Videojet, Gilbarco and Viridor acquisitions. During the first quarter of 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in zero-coupon convertible senior notes due 2021 known as Liquid Yield Option Notes or LYONS. The net proceeds to the Company were approximately $505 million, of which approximately $100 million was used to pay down debt, and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The LYONs carry a yield to maturity of 2.375%. Holders of the LYONs may convert each of their LYONs into 7.2676 shares of Danaher common stock (in the aggregate for all LYONs, approximately 6.0 million shares of Danaher common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January 22, 2021. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time on or after January 22, 2004. Holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash and/or Company common stock, at the Company’s option, on January 22, 2004 or on January 22, 2011. The Company will pay contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six-month period commencing after January 22, 2004 if the average market price of a LYON for a measurement period preceding such six-month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. Except for the contingent interest described above, the Company will not pay interest on the LYONs prior to maturity. Total debt under the Company’s borrowing facilities increased to $1,310.0 million at December 31, 2002, compared to $1,191.7 million at December 31, 2001. This increase was due primarily to the change in the U.S dollar/Euro exchange rates and the resulting impact on the Company’s Euro denominated debt as well as the effect of assumed debt obligations related to 2002 acquisitions. As discussed previously, as of December 31, 2002, $315 million of the Company’s debt was fixed at a rate of 6.25%, $250 million was fixed at an average interest cost of 6% (subject to the interest rate swaps described above) and the Company’s LYONs obligations (which as of December 31, 2002 amounted to $542 million) carry a yield to maturity of 2.375%(with contingent interest payable as described above). Substantially all remaining borrowings have interest costs that float with referenced base rates. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had unutilized commitments under its revolving credit facility of $500 million. As of December 31, 2002, the Company held $810 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less. As of December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants under the aforementioned debt instruments, including limitations on secured debt and debt levels. None of the Company’s debt instruments contain trigger clauses requiring the Company to repurchase or pay off its debt if rating agencies downgrade the Company’s debt rating. In addition, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company could issue up to approximately $500 million of securities under its shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In January 2002, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the Company’s 6% notes due 2008 having a notional principal amount of $100 million whereby the effective interest rate on $100 million of the notes will be the six month LIBOR rate plus approximately 0.425%. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended, the Company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges. Since these instruments qualify as “effective” or “perfect” hedges, they will have no impact on net income or stockholders’ equity. Due to declines in the equity markets, the fair value of the Company’s pension fund assets has decreased since 2001. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions”, the Company recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment of $76.9 million (net of tax benefit of $39.6 million) at December 31, 2002. This adjustment results in a direct charge to stockholders’ equity and does not impact net income, but is included in other comprehensive income. Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in such calculations. These assumptions include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may affect the Company’s financial position or results of operations. For 2003, the Company anticipates lowering the expected long-term rate of return assumption from 9% to 8.5% for the Company’s defined benefit pension plans. The Company anticipates there will be no funding requirements for the defined benefit plans in 2003. In the third and fourth quarters of 2001, the Company repurchased 375,500 shares of its common stock at a cost of $17.3 million. In the first quarter of 2000, the Company repurchased 2,042,300 shares of the Company’s common stock for total consideration of $82.2 million. The ongoing costs of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Company’s cash flows or financial position. 16 Table of Contents The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures, and to pay interest and service debt. In order to meet these cash requirements, the Company intends to use available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under its credit facility or under uncommitted lines of credit. The Company believes that cash provided from these sources will be adequate to meet its cash requirements for the foreseeable future. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following tables summarize, as of December 31, 2002, and by period due or expiration of commitment, certain of the Company’s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments. Payments due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1–3 Years 4–5 Years Over 5 Years (in thousands) Long-term debt (a) $ 1,309,964 $ 112,542 $ 385,949 $ 5,792 $ 805,681 Non-cancelable operating leases (b) 261,000 54,000 78,000 56,000 73,000 Total $ 1,570,964 $ 166,542 $ 463,949 $ 61,792 $ 878,681 (a) As described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (b) As described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Other Commercial Commitments Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Total Amounts Committed Less than 1 Year 1–3 Years 4–5 Years Over 5 Years (in thousands) Standby Letters of Credit and Performance Bonds $ 58,000 $ 51,000 $ 7,000 — — Guarantees 102,000 100,000 2,000 — — Contingent Purchase Consideration 60,000 — 10,000 10,000 40,000 Standby Repurchase Obligations 2,000 1,000 1,000 — — Total Commercial Commitments $ 222,000 $ 152,000 $ 20,000 $ 10,000 $ 40,000 Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are generally issued to secure the Company’s obligations under short-term contracts to purchase raw materials and components for manufacture and for performance under specific manufacturing agreements. In general these commitments do not extend for more than a few months. Guarantees reflected in the table above primarily relate to the Company’s Matco subsidiary, which has sold, with recourse, or provided credit enhancements for certain of its accounts receivable and notes receivable. Amounts outstanding under this program approximated $93 million, $92 million and $70 million as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The subsidiary accounts for such sales in accordance with SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities—a replacement of SFAS No. 125.” A provision for estimated losses as a result of the recourse has been included in accrued expenses. No gain or loss arose from these transactions. In connection with the Company’s acquisition of Thomson, the Company has entered into agreements to pay $15 million over the next 6 years, and an additional maximum contingent consideration of up to $60 million cash based on the future performance of Thomson through December 31, 2005. Aside from the sale of accounts receivable described above, the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Thomson, the leases included in the table above, and certain performance bonds and guarantees included in the table above, the Company has not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements as of December 31, 2002. Also, the Company does not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities as of December 31, 2002. 17 Table of Contents ACCOUNTING POLICIES Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, income taxes, and contingencies and litigation. The Company bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect management’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounts receivable. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company’s customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Inventory. The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market. The estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, reductions in the value of inventory may be required. Acquired intangibles. The Company’s business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the Company will incur. The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, the new accounting standard for goodwill, which requires that the Company, on an annual basis, calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists. Impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status. Management judgment is required in calculating the fair value of the reporting units. Long-lived assets. The Company periodically evaluates the net realizable value of long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, relying on a number of factors including operating results, budgets, economic projections and anticipated future cash flows. Purchase accounting. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company assesses and formulates a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity. This process begins during the due diligence process and is concluded within twelve months of the acquisition. The Company accrues estimates for certain costs, related primarily to personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings, anticipated at the date of acquisition, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 95-3, “Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination.” Adjustments to these estimates are made up to 12 months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized. To the extent these accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose, the excess is recorded as a reduction of the purchase price, typically by reducing recorded goodwill balances. Costs incurred in excess of the recorded accruals are expensed as incurred. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, “Business Combinations.” This statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, and establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill. The Company has followed the requirements of this statement for business acquisitions made after June 30, 2001. See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” This statement requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life not be amortized. Instead of amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life, the statement requires a test for impairment to be performed annually, or immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment, measured on a reporting unit basis, could exist. The Company adopted the statement effective January 1, 2002. Danaher has nine reporting units closely aligned with the Company’s strategic platforms and specialty 18 Table of Contents niche businesses. They are as follows: Tools, Motion, Electronic Test, Power Quality, Environmental, Aerospace and Defense, Industrial Controls, Level/Flow, and Product Identification. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 142, the Company will no longer record goodwill amortization which amounted to approximately $55 million and $46 million, net of tax, in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Using the fair value measurement requirement, rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach, the Company recorded an impairment related to the Company’s power quality business unit of $200 million ($173.8 million after tax), approximately 8.7% of intangible assets recorded as of January 1, 2002. The following table provides the comparable effects of adopting of SFAS No. 142 for the two years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. For the Years Ended December 31: 2001 2000 (in thousands except earning per share amounts) Reported Net Earnings $297,665 $324,213 Add back: Goodwill Amortization (net of tax) 54,978 45,995 Adjusted Net Earnings $352,643 $370,208 Basic Net Earnings per Share 2001 2000 Reported Net Earnings $2.07 $2.28 Add back: Goodwill Amortization (net of tax) .39 .32 Adjusted Net Earnings $2.46 $2.60 Diluted Net Earnings per Share 2001 2000 Reported Net Earnings $2.01 $2.23 Add back: Goodwill Amortization (net of tax) .36 .31 Adjusted Net Earnings $2.37 $2.54 In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.” SFAS No. 143 addresses accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The Company does not believe that implementation of this SFAS will have a material impact on its financial statements. In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets,” which supersedes SFAS No. 121. Though it retains the basic requirements of SFAS No. 121 regarding when and how to measure an impairment loss, SFAS No. 144 provides additional implementation guidance. SFAS No. 144 applies to long-lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of, including assets under capital leases of lessees; assets subject to operating leases of lessors; and prepaid assets. SFAS No. 144 also expands the scope of a discontinued operation to include a component of an entity, and eliminates the current exemption to consolidation when control over a subsidiary is likely to be temporary. This statement was effective January 1, 2002. Implementation of this SFAS did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. In April 2002, the FASB approved SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of SFAS No. 13, and Technical Corrections.” SFAS No. 145 rescinds previous accounting guidance, which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary item. Under SFAS No. 145, classification of debt extinguishment depends on the facts and circumstances of the transaction. SFAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The Company does not expect this SFAS to have a material impact on its financial statements. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring).” SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, rather than at the date of the entity’s commitment to an exit plan. This statement is effective for exit and disposal activities that are 19 Table of Contents initiated after December 31, 2002. Since adoption of this SFAS is prospective, the Company does not believe that the implementation of this SFAS will have a material impact on its financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 148 (FAS 148), “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure” which amends FASB No. 123 (FAS 123), “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” FAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of FAS 123 to require disclosures in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The transition guidance and disclosure provisions of FAS 148 will be effective for the Company’s financial statements issued for the first quarter of 2003. As allowed by FAS 123, the Company follows the disclosure requirements of FAS 123, but continues to account for its employee stock option plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”, which results in no charge to earnings when options are issued at fair market value. Therefore, at this time, adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. In December 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” FIN 45 requires a guarantor to make additional disclosures in its interim and annual financial statements regarding the guarantor’s obligations. In additions, FIN 45 requires, under certain circumstances, that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of the guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken when issuing the guarantee. The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. ITEM 7A.

313616,DHR,DANAHER CORP /DE/,2004,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with its audited consolidated financial statements. OVERVIEW Danaher Corporation derives its revenue from the design, manufacture and marketing of industrial and consumer products, which are typically characterized by strong brand names, proprietary technology and major market positions, in two business segments: Process/Environmental Controls and Tools and Components. As discussed in greater detail below, subsequent to December 31, 2003 the Company acquired Radiometer A/S and substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of the Gendex business of Dentsply International, Inc., adding medical technology products to the Process/Environmental Controls segment for 2004. These businesses, the core of a new Medical Technology platform, are expected to provide additional revenue and earnings growth opportunities for the Company both through growth of the existing businesses and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses. The Company strives to create shareholder value through delivering revenue growth, excluding the impact of acquired businesses, in excess of the overall market growth for its products and services; upper quartile financial performance when compared against peer 11 companies; and upper quartile cash flow generation from operations. To accomplish these goals, the Company uses a set of tools and processes, known as the Danaher Business System (“DBS”), which are designed to continuously improve business performance in critical areas of quality, delivery, cost and innovation. The Company will also acquire other businesses when they strategically fit with existing operations or when they are of such a nature and size as to establish a new strategic platform. The extent to which appropriate acquisitions are made and integrated can affect the Company’s overall growth and operating results. As a global business, Danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry economic and political factors. However, Danaher’s geographic and industry diversity, as well as the diversity of its product sales and services, has helped limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results. For the majority of 2003, market indicators of the global manufacturing economy remained mixed. While differences exist among the Company’s businesses, the Company’s markets strengthened in the second half of 2003 and the Company experienced strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2003 when compared against the fourth quarter of 2002. Given order and revenue trends in December 2003, January and February 2004, we expect the higher level of revenues experienced in the fourth quarter of 2003, adjusted for the seasonality of certain of our businesses, to continue into the early part of the 2004 fiscal year. Consolidated revenues for 2003 increased approximately 15.5% over 2002. Acquisitions accounted for approximately 10% growth, favorable currency translation, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the Euro, contributed approximately 4% growth and revenues from existing businesses for the year (defined as businesses that have been part of the Company for each comparable period reported excluding currency effect) contributed 1.5% growth. Substantially all of this sales growth from existing businesses occurred in the fourth quarter as the Company’s revenues from existing businesses for the first three quarters of 2003 were generally consistent with 2002’s comparable revenues. The Company continues to operate in a highly competitive business environment in most of the markets and geographies served. The Company will continue to assess market needs with the objective of positioning itself to provide superior products and services to its customers in a cost efficient manner. With the formation of the Medical Technology platform noted above, the Company expects to devote significant attention to the successful integration of these acquired businesses into the organization. Management believes it has the resources to successfully integrate these businesses into the Company. In addition, as noted above the Company benefited from the impact of favorable currency trends in its international businesses in 2003. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its investment in foreign operations without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Therefore, both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of revenue and profit in the consolidated financial statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table summarizes sales by business segment for each of the past three years: (in thousands) 2003 2002 2001 Process/Environmental Controls $ 4,096,686 77.4 % $ 3,385,154 74.0 % $ 2,616,797 69.2 % Tools and Components 1,197,190 22.6 % 1,192,078 26.0 % 1,165,647 30.8 % $ 5,293,876 100.0 % $ 4,577,232 100.0 % $ 3,782,444 100.0 % PROCESS/ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS The Process/Environmental Controls segment is comprised of businesses which produce and sell compact, professional electronic test tools; product identification equipment and consumables; water quality instrumentation and consumables; retail petroleum automation products; underground storage tank leak detection systems; motion, position, speed, temperature, and level instruments and sensing devices; power switches and controls; communication line products; power protection products; liquid flow and quality measuring devices; quality assurance products and systems; safety devices; and electronic and mechanical counting and controlling devices. Process/Environmental Controls Selected Financial Data For the years ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Sales $ 4,096.7 $ 3,385.2 $ 2,616.8 Operating profit $ 674.3 $ 540.5 $ 388.6 Operating profit as a % of sales 16.5 % 16.0 % 14.9 % 12 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 Segment Overview Sales of the Process/Environmental Controls segment increased 21% in 2003 compared to 2002. The fourth quarter 2002 acquisition of Thomson Industries, and the 2003 acquisition of Willett International Limited (“Willett”), together with several other smaller acquisitions provided a 14% increase in segment sales. This increase was in addition to an approximate 5% favorable currency translation impact. Sales from existing businesses for this segment were up approximately 2% compared to 2002, principally from sales increases in the motion, environmental and product identification businesses. Prices were essentially flat compared to 2002. Operating profit margins for the segment were 16.5% in 2003 compared to 16% in 2002. Operating profit margins for 2002 included approximately 40 basis points of benefit associated with gains on the sale of real estate and adjustments to the restructuring reserves established in 2001. The overall improvement in operating profit margins was driven primarily by on-going cost reductions associated with our DBS initiatives completed during 2003, and margin improvements in recently acquired businesses, which typically have higher cost structures than the Company’s existing operations. Business Overview Environmental. Revenues from the Company’s environmental businesses, representing approximately 30% of segment revenue in 2003, increased approximately 15.5% in 2003 compared to 2002. Acquisitions completed in 2002 and 2003 accounted for approximately 7.5% growth, revenues from existing businesses provided 2% growth and favorable currency translation provided 6% growth. Operations were impacted by strength in the second half of 2003 in the Gilbarco Veeder-Root retail petroleum equipment business, resulting in part from market-share gains in the U.S. due to the addition of a number of distributors as a result of financial difficulties of a competitor. Increased sales to high-volume retailers and strong year-end purchasing activity from major oil companies with respect to both retail automation and environmental systems also contributed to the strength in the second half of 2003. Sales from existing businesses in the Company’s water quality businesses also contributed to the increase as strength in laboratory instrumentation sales in Europe was partially offset by softness in the U.S. laboratory instrumentation and ultrapure markets due to continued weakness in the semiconductor and electrical assembly markets and due to several large contracts in 2002 not repeating in 2003. The US laboratory equipment markets showed strength in the fourth quarter of 2003 compared against the first three quarters of 2003. The business continues to focus on faster growing markets in developing countries such as China to enhance its growth prospects. Motion. Sales in the Company’s motion businesses, representing approximately 20% of 2003’s segment revenues, grew 33%, as acquisitions provided growth of 21% (primarily from the Thomson Industries acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2002) and favorable currency translation effects provided 8% growth to drive this increase. The existing businesses’ revenues accounted for 4% growth, reflecting share gains in certain of its end markets, including electric vehicles and direct drives, partially offset by year over year low-single digit declines in the Company’s linear actuator product businesses resulting from integration of the sales channels associated with the Thomson acquisition. The Company’s linear actuator businesses showed low-single digit growth in the fourth quarter representing the first quarter of growth for this business in 2003, reflecting increased shipments for military programs as well as increased sales to the Company’s distribution network. Electronic Test. Electronic test revenues, representing approximately 16% of 2003’s segment revenues, grew 13% during 2003 compared to 2002. Acquisitions, principally the Raytek Corporation acquisition, completed in August 2002, provided 9% growth, which includes strong sales of Raytek’s non-contact temperature measurement and thermal imaging products. Favorable currency translation provided 5% growth. These factors were partially offset by an approximate 1% decline in sales from existing businesses due primarily to continued softness in telecommunications and data network markets. The Company’s network-test business strengthened in the second half of 2003, compared to the first half of 2003, to post low-single digit declines for the year. Product Identification. In February 2002, the Company established its Product Identification business with the acquisition of Videojet Technologies. In January 2003 Willett was added to this business and Accu-Sort Systems, Inc. was acquired in November 2003. The Product Identification business accounted for approximately 12% of segment revenues in 2003. For 2003, Product Identification revenues grew 65% compared to 2002, with the Willett and Accu-Sort acquisitions providing 55% growth, favorable currency impacts of approximately 5%, and existing operations providing 5% growth, based largely on broad based equipment sales increases. Focused Niche Businesses. The segment’s niche businesses in the aggregate showed high-single digit revenue growth in 2003, primarily from acquisitions in the Company’s Aerospace and Defense and Industrial Controls businesses. 13 2002 COMPARED TO 2001 Segment Overview Sales of the Process/Environmental Controls segment increased 29% in 2002 compared to 2001. The acquisitions in February 2002 of Gilbarco and Videojet Technologies as well as several smaller 2001 and 2002 acquisitions provided a 36% increase in segment sales. This increase was offset by an 8% unit volume decline in existing businesses. A favorable currency translation impact provided a 1% revenue increase, and prices were essentially flat compared to 2001. Operating profit margins for the segment were 16.0% in 2002 compared to 14.9% in 2001. Approximately 130 basis points of the change in operating margin resulted from the dilutive impact of lower operating margins of the new businesses acquired during 2001 and 2002. Additionally, margin declines from lower sales volumes at the business units described above, and increases in expenditures on growth opportunities in the segment, were offset by the cessation of goodwill amortization as of January 1, 2002, and other cost reductions including the partial benefit of the 2001 restructuring actions. Business Overview Revenues from the Company’s environmental business, representing approximately 30% of segment revenue, increased over 90% in 2002 compared to 2001, resulting primarily from the acquisitions of Gilbarco and Viridor in February 2002 and two smaller acquisitions completed in 2002 and 2001. Acquisitions provided the entirety of this growth, as revenues from existing businesses declined approximately 2%. Modest growth in the Company’s water quality business units was offset by weakness in demand for ultrapure instrumentation, brought on primarily by weakness in semiconductor end markets, and in Veeder-Root’s leak detection market. The Company believes geopolitical uncertainties in oil-producing regions contributed to the decline in demand in the end markets served by the Gilbarco/Veeder-Root business in 2002. Electronic test revenues, representing approximately 20% of segment revenues, grew 6% during 2002, also due to acquisition activity. Acquisitions contributed 11% of this growth, which was offset by a revenue decline from existing businesses of 5%, resulting from weakness in both industrial and network test equipment sales. Sales in the Company’s motion businesses, representing approximately 20% of segment revenues, declined 3%, as a revenue decline from existing businesses of 9% was offset by acquisition growth of 6%. Continued softness in semiconductor and electronic assembly end market demand was a leading factor in motion’s revenue decline from existing businesses. Aerospace and defense revenues increased 7% in 2002, resulting from acquisition activity of 5% and revenue growth from existing businesses of 2%. Power quality sales declined 28% in 2002, due to a significant decline in end user demand that began in early 2001 and has continued through 2002. Sales of the Company’s industrial controls product lines fell 7% due to recession-related weakness in their served end markets. In February 2002, the Company established its product identification business with the acquisition of Videojet Technologies, which accounted for approximately 11% of the segment’s growth during 2002. TOOLS AND COMPONENTS The Tools and Components segment is one of the largest domestic producers and distributors of general purpose and specialty mechanics’ hand tools. Other products manufactured by the businesses in this segment include toolboxes and storage devices; diesel engine retarders; wheel service equipment; drill chucks; custom-designed headed tools and components; hardware and components for the power generation and transmission industries; and high-quality precision socket screws, fasteners, and miniature precision parts. Tools and Components Selected Financial Data For the years ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Sales $ 1,197.2 $ 1,192.1 $ 1,165.6 Operating profit $ 173.8 $ 181.4 $ 131.8 Operating profit as a % sales 14.5 % 15.2 % 11.3 % 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 Revenues in the Tools and Components segment grew 0.4% in 2003. The entirety of this growth represents growth in sales volume from existing businesses, as there were no acquisitions in this segment during either 2002 or 2003. Price and currency impacts on revenues were negligible. Mechanics Hand Tools revenues, representing approximately two-thirds of segment sales in 2003, grew 14 approximately 3.5% for the year, driven primarily by increases in sales from the group’s retail hand tool product lines which rebounded in the second half of 2003 as sales to the group’s largest customer strengthened through the third and fourth quarters of 2003. In addition, both the Company’s Matco and Asian distribution channels showed growth for 2003. Offsetting these increases was a net sales decline in the segment’s niche businesses, as continued weakness in shipments of truck and industrial boxes, drill chucks and pole-line hardware driven by weak end markets and increased competition from low-cost competitors was partially offset by revenue gains in the Company’s wheel service equipment product lines. Also, sales of diesel engine retarders fell during 2003, reflecting decreased end-user demand as compared to 2002. In 2002, the business experienced an inventory build-up by customers in advance of regulatory changes implemented in 2002. Operating profit margins for the segment were 14.5% in 2003 compared to 15.2% in 2002. Operating profit margins in 2002 benefited by 10 basis points from the reversal of unutilized accruals established for the 2001 restructuring program. Margin improvements at the Jacobs Chuck business unit related to the 2001 restructuring program, and other cost reductions, were offset by margin declines at the Delta Industries business unit related to the volume decrease noted above, the impact of lower engine retarder sales, and by spending on certain cost reduction and growth opportunities. The Company believes operating profit margins will return to the levels experienced in 2002 as the impact of spending initiatives are expected to yield benefits in 2004. 2002 COMPARED TO 2001 Revenues in the Tools and Components segment grew 2% in 2002. The entirety of this growth represents sales volume growth from existing businesses, as there were no acquisitions in this segment during 2001 and 2002, and price and currency impacts were negligible. Mechanics Hand Tool revenues, representing approximately 65% of segment sales, grew 2%, generated primarily by increases in the Matco sales channel as a result of continued market share gains. Additionally, hand tool revenues in the Company’s Asian channels grew, but were offset by declines in domestic retail channels. Sales of diesel engine retarders at the Jacobs Vehicle Systems business unit increased significantly, as OEM customers accelerated their 2002 order rates to meet a regulatory deadline. Diesel engine retarder demand declined sharply following passage of the regulatory deadline in October 2002. Increases in this segment in 2002 were offset by declines in the Delta and Jacobs Chuck business units. Operating profit margins for the segment were 15.2% in 2002 compared to 11.3% in 2001. This increase resulted from the effect of higher revenue levels, the cessation of goodwill amortization as of January 1, 2002, and other cost reductions including the partial benefit of the 2001 restructuring actions. GROSS PROFIT For the years ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Sales $ 5,293.9 $ 4,577.2 $ 3,782.4 Cost of sales $ 3,154.8 $ 2,791.2 $ 2,338.0 Gross profit 2,139.1 1,786.0 1,444.4 Gross profit margin 40.4 % 39.0 % 38.2 % Gross profit margin for 2003 was 40.4%, an increase of 140 basis points compared to 39.0% in 2002. This increase results from the benefits of the 2001 restructuring program, on-going cost improvements in existing business units driven by our DBS processes, generally higher gross profit margins in businesses acquired, cost reductions in business units acquired during the first quarter of 2002 and the leverage created from higher revenues during the year. The Company’s restructuring program announced in the fourth quarter of 2001 is estimated to have provided approximately $38 million of savings to the full year 2003 when compared against the 2001 period. This restructuring was complete at the beginning of 2003. Gross profit margins are expected to improve in 2004, reflecting ongoing cost improvements in existing business units driven by the Company’s DBS processes, continued cost savings from low-cost region sourcing initiatives as well as the impact of higher margins from recent acquisitions. These improvements could be affected by higher raw material costs and supply constraints resulting from the improving overall economy. Gross profit margin in 2002 was 39.0%, a 80 basis point increase compared to 38.2% achieved in 2001. This increase resulted from the benefits of the 2001 restructuring program and other improvements in the gross margins of core business units, in addition to the effect of slightly higher gross margins of newly acquired businesses. 15 OPERATING EXPENSES For the years ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Sales $ 5,293.9 $ 4,577.2 $ 3,782.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 1,315.6 $ 1,091.2 $ 872.7 SG&A as a % of sales 24.9 % 23.8 % 23.1 % In 2003, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were 24.9% of sales, an increase of 110 basis points from 2002 levels. This increase is due primarily to additional spending to fund growth opportunities throughout the Company, as well as the impact of newly acquired businesses and their higher relative operating expense structures. In addition, SG&A expenses in 2002 included approximately 20 basis points of benefit associated with gains from the sale of real estate recorded in 2002. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2002 were 23.8% of sales, an increase of 70 basis points from 2001 levels. This increase is due primarily to the effect of newly acquired businesses and their higher relative cost structures, partially offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization effective January 1, 2002 and the gains on real estate sales mentioned above. GAIN ON PENSION PLAN CURTAILMENT The Company recorded a curtailment gain in 2003 as a result of freezing substantially all associates’ ongoing participation in its Cash Balance Plan effective December 31, 2003. The gain totaled $22.5 million ($14.6 million after tax, or $0.09 per share) and represents the unrecognized benefits associated with prior plan amendments that were being amortized into income over the remaining service period of our participating associates prior to freezing the plan. As discussed in more detail below, the Company will continue recording pension expense related to this plan, primarily representing interest costs on the accumulated benefit obligation and amortization of actuarial losses accumulated in the plan prior to the above curtailment. RESTRUCTURING CHARGE In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $69.7 million ($43.5 million after tax, or $0.29 per share) related to restructuring certain of its product lines, principally its drill chuck, power quality and industrial controls divisions, to improve financial performance. The primary objective of the restructuring plan was to reduce operating costs by consolidating, eliminating and/or downsizing existing operating locations. No significant product lines were discontinued. A table describing the components of the restructuring accrual is included in Note 4 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. This restructuring is estimated to have provided annual pre-tax cost reduction, net of increased costs at other facilities, of approximately $38 million of which approximately 50% was realized in 2002 with the full annual benefit realized in 2003. As of December 31, 2002, the restructuring program had been substantially completed as planned. Due to minor changes to the original restructuring plan and to costs incurred being less than estimated, in December 2002, the Company recorded a benefit related to adjusting its unutilized restructuring reserves by approximately $6.3 million ($4.1 million after tax, or $0.03 per share). INTEREST COSTS AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS For a description of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness, please refer to “—Liquidity and Capital Resources — Financing Activities and Indebtedness” below. Interest expense of $59 million in 2003 was approximately $5 million higher than the corresponding 2002 period. The increase in interest expense is due primarily to the unfavorable impact of the Euro/US Dollar exchange rate on interest expense related to the Company’s $378 million of 6.25% Eurobond notes due 2005 partially offset by reduced debt levels resulting from net repayments of approximately $146 million of outstanding indebtedness during 2003. Interest expense of approximately $54 million in 2002 was $6 million higher than 2001. Interest income of $10 million, $10 million, and $22 million was recognized in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Average invested cash balances have grown over the period from 2001 to 2003, but have been largely offset by lower average interest rates earned on these deposits. INCOME TAXES The 2003 effective tax rate of 32.6% is 1.4% lower than the 2002 effective rate, mainly due to the effect of a higher proportion of foreign earnings in 2003 compared to 2002 and the impact of additional research and experimentation credits available to reduce the 16 U.S. tax liabilities. The Company expects to further reduce its effective tax rate for 2004 to 31.5% reflecting the continuing benefit of deriving an increasing proportion of the Company’s earnings from international operations. In addition, the impact on the Company’s effective tax rate resulting from the Radiometer acquisition completed in the first quarter of 2004 has not been fully analyzed but the addition of the Radiometer business, which is based in Denmark and has significant operations outside the United States, could further reduce the effective tax rate. The 2002 effective tax rate of 34.0% was 3.5% lower than the 2001 effective rate, mainly due to the effect of adopting SFAS No. 142 and the resulting cessation of goodwill amortization, and also due to a higher proportion of foreign earnings in 2002 compared to 2001. In connection with the completion of a federal income tax audit, the Company adjusted certain income tax related reserves established related to the sale of a previously discontinued operation and recorded a $30 million credit to its fourth quarter 2002 income statement. This credit has been classified separately below net earnings from continuing operations since the tax reserves related to a previously discontinued operation. INFLATION The effect of inflation on the Company’s operations has been minimal in 2003, 2002 and 2001. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and credit risk, which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company manages its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. In addition, the Company’s broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole. The fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates. The value of this debt is subject to change as a result of movements in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to evaluate this potential impact. Based on a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis-point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2003, the market value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt would decrease by approximately $17 million. This methodology has certain limitations, and these hypothetical gains or losses would not be reflected in the Company’s results of operations or financial conditions under current accounting principles. In January 2002, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the $250 million aggregate principal amount of 6% notes due 2008 having an aggregate notional principal amount of $100 million whereby the effective interest rate on $100 million of these notes is the six month LIBOR rate plus approximately 0.425%. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended, the Company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges. These instruments qualify as “effective” or “perfect” hedges. The Company has a number of manufacturing sites throughout the world and sells its products in more than 30 countries. As a result, it is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the United States dollar and against the currencies of countries in which it manufactures and sells products and services. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. The Company’s issuance of Eurobond notes in 2000 provides a natural hedge to a portion of the Company’s European net asset position. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its foreign operations without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Other than the above noted swap arrangements, there were no material derivative instrument transactions during any of the periods presented. Additionally, the Company does not have significant commodity contracts or derivatives. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, our interest rate swap agreements and trade accounts receivable. The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to its financial instruments. The Company anticipates, however, that counter parties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under these instruments. The Company places cash and temporary investments and its interest rate swap agreements with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world, and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company does not obtain collateral or other security to support these financial instruments, it does periodically evaluate the credit standing of the counter party financial institutions. In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to selling to a large number of customers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial conditions and obtains collateral or other security when appropriate. 17 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity For the years ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Total operating cash flows $ 861.5 $ 710.3 $ 608.5 Purchases of property, plant and equipment $ (80.3 ) $ (65.4 ) $ (84.5 ) Cash paid for acquisitions (312.3 ) (1,158.1 ) (439.8 ) Other sources 24.5 79.0 36.7 Net cash used in investing activities $ (368.1 ) $ (1,144.5 ) $ (487.6 ) Proceeds from the issuance of common stock $ 50.5 $ 512.1 $ 28.2 Proceeds (repayments) of borrowings, net (145.5 ) 17.7 410.5 Other uses (15.3 ) (13.5 ) (29.0 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (110.3 ) $ 516.3 $ 409.7 • Operating cash flow, a key source of the Company’s liquidity, was $862 million for 2003, an increase of $151 million, or approximately 21% as compared to 2002. The increase in operating cash flow was driven primarily by earnings growth as well as continued improvements in the Company’s working capital management. • As of December 31, 2003, the Company held approximately $­­­1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, approximately $772 million (net of cash acquired) of which were used to fund the acquisitions completed subsequent to December 31, 2003 noted below. • Acquisitions constituted the most significant use of cash in all periods presented. The Company acquired twelve companies and product lines during 2003 for total consideration of approximately $312 million in cash, including transaction costs. Subsequent to December 31, 2003 and prior to the date of the Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company acquired three additional businesses for total consideration of approximately $772 million in cash (net of cash acquired), including transaction costs. • Due to declines in the equity markets in 2001 and 2002, the fair value of the Company’s pension fund assets has decreased below the accumulated benefit obligation due to the participants in the plan. After recording a minimum pension liability adjustment of $76.9 million (net of tax benefit of $39.6 million) at December 31, 2002, the Company increased the minimum pension liability to $114.1 million (net of tax benefit of $59.6 million) at December 31, 2003 as a result of changes in actuarial assumptions, including the impact of the plan curtailment noted above. While not statutorily required to make contributions to the plan for 2003, the Company contributed $10 million to the plan before December 31, 2003. The Company anticipates there will be no statutory funding requirements for the defined benefit plan in 2004. Operating Activities The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position, with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. Operating cash flow, a key source of the Company’s liquidity, was $­­­­862 million for 2003, an increase of $151 million, or approximately 21% as compared to 2002. The increase in operating cash flow was driven primarily by earnings growth as well as the impact of the timing of payments for certain of the Company’s benefit programs, including 401(k) and employee health plan contributions. In addition, working capital improved in 2003 compared to 2002 but at a slower level than in 2002. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $368 million in 2003 compared to approximately $1.1 billion of net cash used in 2002. Gross capital spending of $80 million for 2003 increased $15 million from 2002, due to capital spending relating to new acquisitions and spending related to the Company’s low-cost region sourcing initiatives. Capital expenditures are made primarily for machinery, equipment and the improvement of facilities. Gross capital spending of $65 million for 2002 decreased $19 million from 2001, as increased capital spending from new acquisitions was more than offset by declines in core businesses. In 2004, the Company expects capital spending of approximately $100 million. Disposals of fixed assets yielded approximately $13 million of cash proceeds for 2003, primarily due to the sale of four facilities and other real property. Disposals of fixed assets yielded $26 million of cash proceeds for 2002, primarily due to the sale of six facilities during the year. Net pre-tax gains of $0.9 million and $6.0 million were recorded in 2003 and 2002, 18 respectively, on these sales and are included as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of earnings. In addition, as discussed below, the Company completed several business acquisitions during 2003, 2002 and 2001. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company had also completed three acquisitions subsequent to December 31, 2003. All of the acquisitions during this time period have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Company’s financial statements. This goodwill typically arises because the purchase prices for these targets reflect the competitive nature of the process by which we acquired the targets and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these targets bring to existing operations. For a discussion of other factors resulting in the recognition of goodwill see Note 3 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 2003 Acquisitions The Company acquired twelve companies and product lines during 2003 for total consideration of approximately $312 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired. The Company also assumed debt with an estimated fair market value of approximately $45 million in connection with these acquisitions. In connection with one of the 2003 acquisitions, the Company entered into an agreement to pay an additional maximum contingent consideration of up to $36.8 million in November 2008 based on future performance of the acquired business through November 2008. In general, each company is a manufacturer and assembler of environmental or instrumentation products, in markets such as Product Identification, Environmental and Aerospace and Defense. These companies were all acquired to complement existing units of the Process/Controls segment. The aggregated annual revenue of the acquired businesses is approximately $361 million and each of these twelve companies individually has less than $125 million in annual revenues. In addition, the Company sold one facility acquired in connection with a prior acquisition for approximately $11.6 million in net proceeds. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale and the proceeds have been included in proceeds from divestitures in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 2002 Acquisitions On February 25, 2002, the Company completed the divestiture of API Heat Transfer, Inc. to an affiliate of Madison Capital Partners for approximately $63 million (including $53 million in net cash and a note receivable in the principal amount of $10 million), less certain liabilities of API Heat Transfer, Inc. paid by the Company at and subsequent to closing. On February 5, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Marconi Data Systems, formerly known as Videojet Technologies, from Marconi plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $400 million in net cash including transaction costs. On February 4, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Viridor Instrumentation Limited from the Pennon Group plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $137 million in net cash including transaction costs. On February 1, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Marconi Commerce Systems, formerly known as Gilbarco, from Marconi plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $309 million in cash including transaction costs (net of $17 million of acquired cash). On October 18, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Thomson Industries, Inc. in a stock and asset acquisition, for approximately $147 million in cash including transaction costs (net of $2 million of acquired cash), an agreement to pay $15 million over the next six years, and an additional maximum contingent consideration of up to $60 million cash based on the future performance of Thomson through December 31, 2005. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company acquired eight smaller companies, for total consideration of approximately $186 million in net cash including transaction costs. 2001 Acquisitions On January 2, 2001, the Company acquired 100% of the assets of United Power Corporation for approximately $108 million in net cash including transaction costs. The Company acquired 11 smaller companies during 2001 for total net cash consideration of approximately $343 million including transaction costs. The Company also disposed of two small product lines during 2001, yielding cash proceeds of approximately $33 million. Recent Acquisition Developments On January 27, 2004, Danaher acquired 95.4% of the share capital of, and 97.9% of the voting rights in, Radiometer S/A for approximately $652 million in cash (net of $77 million in acquired cash), including transaction costs, pursuant to a tender offer announced on December 11, 2003. In addition, Danaher assumed $65 million of debt in connection with the acquisition. Danaher submitted a mandatory tender offer for the remaining outstanding shares of Radiometer on February 4, 2004 as required under Danish law and intends to effect a compulsory redemption of the remaining outstanding shares as permitted under Danish law. Once all of the Radiometer shares are acquired, it is expected that the total consideration for such shares, including transaction costs, will be approximately $687 million in cash (net of $77 million in acquired cash). Radiometer has total annual revenues of approximately $300 million. In addition, on February 27, 2004, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of the Gendex business of Dentsply International, Inc. for approximately $105 million in net cash, including transaction costs. Gendex has annual revenues of approximately $100 million. The Company also completed the acquisition of a small instrument company subsequent to December 31, 2003. The Company funded all three acquisitions from existing cash reserves. 19 Financing Activities and Indebtedness Financing activities used cash of $110 million during 2003 compared to $516 million generated during 2002. The primary reason for the difference was the Company’s issuance of 6.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock in March 2002. Proceeds of the common stock issuance, net of the related expenses, were approximately $467 million. The Company used the proceeds to repay approximately $230 million of short-term borrowings incurred in the first quarter of 2002 related to the Videojet, Gilbarco and Viridor acquisitions noted above. The balance of the proceeds was used for general corporate purposes. Total debt decreased to $1,298.8 million at December 31, 2003, compared to $1,310.0 million at December 31, 2002. This decrease was due primarily to net repayments of $146 million of debt, offset in part by the change in the U.S Dollar/Euro exchange rates and the resulting increase in the carrying value of the Company’s Euro denominated debt. All significant debt obligations assumed related to 2003 acquisitions have been repaid. The Company’s debt financing as of December 31, 2003 was composed primarily of $555 million of zero coupon convertible notes due 2021 Liquid Yield Option Notes or LYONs (“LYONs”), $378 million of 6.25% Eurobond notes due 2005 and $250 million of 6% notes due 2008 (subject to the interest rate swaps described above). The Company’s LYONs obligations (described in further detail below) carry a yield to maturity of 2.375% (with contingent interest payable as described below). Substantially all remaining borrowings have interest costs that float with referenced base rates. The Company maintains two revolving senior unsecured credit facilities totaling $1 billion available for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the revolving credit facilities bear interest of Eurocurrency rate plus .21% to .70%, depending on the Company’s debt rating. The credit facilities, each $500 million, have a fixed term expiring June 28, 2006 and July 23, 2006, respectively. There were no borrowings outstanding under either of the Company’s credit facilities at any time during 2003. During the first quarter of 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in LYONs. The net proceeds to the Company were approximately $505 million, of which approximately $100 million was used to pay down debt, and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The LYONs carry a yield to maturity of 2.375%. Holders of the LYONs may convert each of their LYONs into 7.2676 shares of Danaher common stock (in the aggregate for all LYONs, approximately 6.0 million shares of Danaher common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January 22, 2021. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time. Holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash and/or Company common stock, at the Company’s option, on January 22, 2011. The holders had a similar option to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes as of January 22, 2004, which resulted in notes with an accreted value of $1.1 million being redeemed by the Company. These notes were redeemed for cash and therefore this amount has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying financial statements. The Company will pay contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six-month period commencing after January 22, 2004 if the average market price of a LYON for a measurement period preceding such six-month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. Except for the contingent interest described above, the Company will not pay interest on the LYONs prior to maturity. Cash and Cash Requirements As of December 31, 2003, the Company held approximately $­­­1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less, approximately $772 million of which were used to fund the acquisitions completed subsequent to December 31, 2003 noted above. As of December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants under the aforementioned debt instruments, including limitations on secured debt and debt levels. None of the Company’s debt instruments contain trigger clauses requiring the Company to repurchase or pay off its debt if rating agencies downgrade the Company’s debt rating. In addition, as of the date of this Form 10-K, the Company could issue up to $1 billion of securities under its shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures and acquisitions, to pay interest and service debt, fund its pension plans as required and to pay dividends to shareholders. In order to meet these cash requirements, the Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds. The Company currently anticipates that any additional acquisitions consummated during 2004 would be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and, if necessary, through borrowings under its credit facilities, under uncommitted lines of credit or by accessing the capital markets. Pension Fund Assets and Liabilities Due to declines in the equity markets in 2001 and 2002, the fair value of the Company’s pension fund assets has decreased below the accumulated benefit obligation due to the participants in the plan. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions”, the Company recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment of $76.9 million (net of tax benefit of $39.6 million) at December 31, 2002. Based on changes in actuarial assumptions, including the impact of the plan curtailment noted above, the minimum pension liability was increased to $114.1 million (net of tax benefit of $59.6 million) as of December 31, 2003. The 20 minimum pension liability is calculated as the difference between the actuarially determined accumulated benefit obligation and the value of the plan assets as of September 30, 2003 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2003 for additional information). This adjustment results in a direct charge to stockholders’ equity and does not immediately impact net earnings, but is included in other comprehensive income. Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in such calculations. These assumptions include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may affect the Company’s financial position or results of operations. The Company used a 6.0% discount rate in computing the amount of the minimum pension liability to be recorded at December 31, 2003, which represented a decrease in the discount rate of 1.0% from the rate used at December 31, 2002. A further 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the after-tax minimum pension liability approximately $18 million from the amount recorded in the financial statements at December 31, 2003. For 2003, the Company lowered the expected long-term rate of return assumption from 9% to 8.5% for the Company’s defined benefit pension plan reflecting lower expected long-term returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets. The plan maintains between 60 to 70% of its assets in equity portfolios, which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities. The balance of the asset portfolio is invested in high-quality corporate bonds and bond index funds. Including the effect of this change, pension expense for this plan for the year ended December 31, 2003 was approximately $8.5 million (or $5.7 million on an after-tax basis), compared with $1.9 million (or $1.2 million after tax) for this plan in 2002. While not statutorily required to make contributions to the plan for 2003, the Company contributed $10 million to the plan before December 31, 2003. The Company anticipates there will be no statutory funding requirements for the defined benefit plan in 2004. As noted above, the Company curtailed benefits for substantially all associates under the defined benefit plan as of December 31, 2003. The Company will maintain this curtailed plan for the foreseeable future and, as a result, will continue to record the effect of changes in discount rates and expected rates of returns on plan assets on both the minimum pension liability recorded as well as the amount of pension expense reflected in the statement of earnings for future periods. In addition, as part of curtailing benefits under this plan, the Company expanded benefits under its available defined contribution (401-K) plan. The net effect of these plan changes are expected to increase the Company’s total pension expense by approximately $15.9 million (or $10.9 million after tax) for 2004 compared to 2003. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003 under (1) long-term debt obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company’s balance sheet under GAAP. Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years (in millions) Debt and Leases: Long-Term Debt Obligations (a) $ 1,277.7 $ 12.2 $ 458.7 $ 250.5 $ 556.3 Capital Lease Obligations 21.2 2.2 4.7 5.3 9.0 Total Long-Term Debt $ 1,298.9 $ 14.4 $ 463.4 $ 255.8 $ 565.3 Operating Lease Obligations (b) 200.0 44.0 71.0 53.0 32.0 Other: Purchase Obligations (c) 45.1 22.9 22.2 — — Other Long-Term Liabilities Reflected on the Company’s Balance Sheet Under GAAP (d) 578.8 — 160.5 90.0 328.3 Total $ 2,122.8 $ 81.3 $ 717.1 $ 398.8 $ 925.6 21 (a) As described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (b) As described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (c) Consist of agreements to purchase goods or services for consideration greater than $1 million that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. (d) Primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies, performance and operating cost guarantees and estimated environmental remediation costs, post-retirement health, pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities and deferred compensation liabilities. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations are based upon management’s estimates over the terms of these agreements and are largely based upon historical experience. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of certain commercial commitments of the Company. Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Total Amounts Committed Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years (in thousands) Standby Letters of Credit and Performance Bonds $ 111.0 $ 55.0 $ 39.0 $ 2.0 $ 15.0 Guarantees 84.0 81.0 2.0 — 1.0 Contingent Acquisition Consideration 97.1 10.3 20.0 46.8 20.0 Total Commercial Commitments $ 292.1 $ 146.3 $ 61.0 $ 48.8 $ 36.0 Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are generally issued to secure the Company’s obligations under short-term contracts to purchase raw materials and components for manufacture and for performance under specific manufacturing agreements. Guarantees reflected in the table above primarily relate to the Company’s Matco subsidiary, which has sold, with recourse, or provided credit enhancements for certain of its accounts receivable and notes receivable. Amounts outstanding under this program approximated $75 million, $93 million and $92 million as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The subsidiary accounts for such sales in accordance with SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities—a replacement of SFAS No. 125.” A provision for estimated losses as a result of the recourse has been included in accrued expenses. No gain or loss arose from these transactions. In connection with the Company’s acquisition of Thomson, the Company has entered into agreements to pay $15 million over the next 6 years, and an additional maximum contingent consideration of up to $60 million cash based on the future performance of Thomson through December 31, 2005. In connection with one of the 2003 acquisitions, the Company entered into an agreement to pay an additional maximum contingent consideration of up to $36.8 million in November 2008 based on future performance of the acquired business through November 2008. The Company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as environmental liabilities and tax liabilities. The Company cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations, warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the Company does not believe that the liabilities relating to these representations, warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Due to the Company’s downsizing of certain operations pursuant to acquisitions, restructuring plans or otherwise, certain properties leased by the Company have been sublet to third parties. In the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by such sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 22 Except as described above, the Company has not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements as of December 31, 2003. Also, the Company does not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities as of December 31, 2003. Other Contingent Liabilities Certain of the Company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. The Company must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the United States and abroad in connection with its operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and, based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. In addition to the environmental compliance costs, the Company may incur costs related to alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. The Company has projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities, in both the United States and abroad, to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the factors described above under Item 1. Business—Environmental and Safety Regulations. In addition, the Company is from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. In view of the Company’s financial position and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, the Company believes that its liability, if any, related to past or current waste disposal practices and other hazardous material handling practices will not have a material adverse effect on its cash flow. In addition, the ongoing cost of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Company’s cash flows or financial position. In addition, the Company is, from time to time, subject to routine litigation incidental to its business. These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Company’s products, allegations of patent and trademark infringement, and litigation and administrative proceedings involving employment matters and commercial disputes. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages. The Company believes that the results of this litigation and other pending legal proceedings will not have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s cash flows, even before taking into account any related insurance recoveries. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect management’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounts receivable. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company’s customers to make required payments. The Company estimates its anticipated losses from doubtful accounts based on historical collection history as well as by specifically reserving for known doubtful accounts. Estimating losses from doubtful accounts is inherently uncertain because the amount of such losses depends substantially on the financial condition of the Company’s customers, and the Company typically has limited visibility as to the specific financial state of its customers. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate beyond estimates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, the Company would be required to write off additional accounts receivable balances, which would adversely impact the Company’s net earnings, cash flows and balance sheet. Inventories. The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market. The Company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand, technological advances and pricing competition in many of the Company’s markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the Company’s control. As a result, such fluctuations can be difficult to predict. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, the Company would be required to reduce the value of its inventory, which would adversely impact the Company’s cash flows and balance sheet. Acquired intangibles. The Company’s business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the Company will incur. The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, the new accounting standard for goodwill, which requires 23 that the Company, on an annual basis, calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists. Impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status. In calculating the fair value of the reporting units, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. If actual fair value is less than the Company’s estimates, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings. Long-lived assets. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. Judgments made by the Company relate to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and its ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets and are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and anticipated future cash flows. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of long-lived assets, there is risk that the carrying value of the Company’s long-lived assets may require adjustment in future periods. If actual fair value is less than the Company’s estimates, long-lived assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings. Purchase accounting. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company formulates a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 95-3, “Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination”, the Company accrues estimates for certain of the integration costs anticipated at the date of acquisition, including personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings. Adjustments to these estimates are made up to 12 months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized. The Company establishes these accruals based on information obtained during the due diligence process, the Company’s experience in acquiring other companies, and information obtained after the closing about the acquired company’s business, assets and liabilities. The accruals established by the Company are inherently uncertain because they are based on limited information of the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired business as well as the uncertainty of the cost to execute the integration plans for the business. If the accruals established by the Company are insufficient to account for all of the activities required to integrate the acquired entity, the Company would be required to incur an expense, which would adversely affect the Company’s results of operations. To the extent these accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose, the excess is recorded as a reduction of the purchase price, typically by reducing recorded goodwill balances. ITEM 7A.

313616,DHR,DANAHER CORP /DE/,2005,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with its audited consolidated financial statements. OVERVIEW Danaher Corporation derives its sales from the design, manufacture and marketing of industrial and consumer products, which are typically characterized by strong brand names, proprietary technology and major market positions, in three business segments: Professional Instrumentation, Industrial Technologies and Tools & Components. The Company strives to create shareholder value through: • delivering sales growth, excluding the impact of acquired businesses, in excess of the overall market growth for its products and services; • upper quartile financial performance when compared against peer companies; and • upper quartile cash flow generation from operations when compared against peer companies. To accomplish these goals, the Company uses a set of tools and processes, known as the DANAHER BUSINESS SYSTEM (“DBS”), which are designed to continuously improve business performance in critical areas of quality, delivery, cost and innovation. The Company will acquire businesses when they strategically fit with existing operations or when they are of such a nature and size as to establish a new strategic line of business. The extent to which appropriate acquisitions are made and integrated can affect the Company’s overall growth and operating results. The Company also acquires businesses that it believes can help it achieve the objectives described above. Danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations and approximately 45% of 2004 sales derived outside the United States. As a global business, Danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry economic and political factors. However, Danaher’s geographic and industry diversity, as well as the diversity of its product sales and services, has helped limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results. Given the broad range of products manufactured and geographies served, management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the outlook for the Company. The Company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future. In addition, the Company’s order rates are highly indicative of the Company’s future revenue and thus a key measure of anticipated performance. In those industry segments where the Company is a capital equipment provider, revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of the Company’s customers, who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy. While differences exist among the Company’s businesses, the Company’s markets generally strengthened in the second half of 2003 and remained strong throughout 2004. Consolidated revenues for 2004 increased approximately 30% over 2003. Acquisitions accounted for approximately 18.5% growth, favorable currency translation, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the Euro, contributed approximately 2.5% growth and revenues from existing businesses for the year (defined as businesses that have been part of the Company for each comparable period reported excluding currency effect) contributed 9% growth. During 2004, the Company acquired Radiometer A/S, substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of the Gendex business of Dentsply International, Inc., and Kaltenbach & Voigt Gmbh (KaVo), which together form the core of a new Medical Technology business. The Medical Technology business, which is included in the Company’s Professional Instrumentation segment, is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Company both through growth of its existing products and services and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses. While the Company continues to see broad-based strength across most of its businesses and end markets, based on current order rates, certain businesses are expected to experience moderating growth in 2005 due to current global economic conditions, a slowing semi-conductor market and more difficult comparisons with the 2004 periods, which were very strong by historical standards. The Company continues to operate in a highly competitive business environment in most of the markets and geographies served. The Company’s performance will be impacted by its ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities in the markets and geographies served, including trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force, consolidation of competitors and the expansion of market opportunities in Asia. The Company will continue to assess market needs with the objective of positioning itself to provide superior products and services to its customers in a cost efficient manner. With the formation of the Medical Technology business noted above, the Company is devoting significant attention to the successful integration of these acquired businesses into the organization. 15 Table of Contents Although the Company has a U.S. dollar functional currency for reporting purposes, a substantial portion of its sales are derived from foreign countries. Sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated using exchange rates effective during the respective period. Therefore, reported sales are affected by changes in currency rates, which are outside of the control of management. As noted above, the Company benefited from the impact of favorable currency trends in its international businesses during 2004 when compared to 2003. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its investment in foreign operations without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Therefore, both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales and profit in the consolidated financial statements. While currency rates continued to produce positive comparisons on a year over year basis, strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies could adversely impact the Company’s results of operations. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table summarizes sales by business segment for each of the past three years: For the years ended December 31 ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Professional Instrumentation $ 2,915.7 $ 1,916.0 $ 1,676.1 Industrial Technologies 2,667.3 2,180.7 1,709.0 Tools & Components 1,306.3 1,197.2 1,192.1 Total $ 6,889.3 $ 5,293.9 $ 4,577.2 PROFESSIONAL INSTRUMENTATION Businesses in the Professional Instrumentation segment offer professional and technical customers various products and services that are used in connection with the performance of their work. As of December 31, 2004, Professional Instrumentation was Danaher’s largest segment and encompassed three strategic businesses, Environmental, Electronic Test, and Medical Technology. These businesses produce and sell compact, professional electronic test tools and calibration equipment; water quality instrumentation and consumables and ultraviolet disinfection systems; retail/commercial petroleum products and services, including underground storage tank leak detection systems; critical care diagnostic instruments and a wide range of products used by dental professionals. Professional Instrumentation Selected Financial Data Operating Performance For the years ended December 31 ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Sales $ 2,915.7 $ 1,916.0 $ 1,676.1 Operating profit 544.0 357.5 298.2 Operating profit as a % of sales 18.7 % 18.7 % 17.8 % 16 Table of Contents Components of Sales Growth 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 Existing businesses 8.5 % 1.0 % Acquisitions 39.5 % 8.0 % Impact of foreign currency 4.0 % 5.5 % Total 52.0 % 14.5 % 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 Segment Overview Sales of the Professional Instrumentation segment increased approximately 52% in 2004 compared to 2003, largely as a result of sales from acquired businesses, which contributed approximately 39.5% of the overall increase. Sales from existing businesses for this segment contributed approximately 8.5% growth compared to 2003, principally from sales increases in the environmental and electronic test and measurement businesses. Price increases, which are included in sales from existing businesses, contributed less than 1% to overall sales growth compared to 2003. Favorable currency translation impact accounted for approximately 4% of the overall sales increase. Operating profit margins for the segment were 18.7% in 2004, flat compared to 2003. Operating profit margin improvements in the Company’s existing operations were offset by the lower operating margins of acquired businesses, primarily KaVo, which diluted segment margins by approximately 200 basis points compared with 2003. The Company continues to pursue on-going cost reductions through application of the Danaher Business System and low-cost region sourcing and production initiatives which are expected to further improve operating margins at both existing and newly acquired businesses in future periods. Business Overview Environmental. Sales from the Company’s environmental businesses, representing approximately 49% of segment sales in 2004, increased approximately 16% in 2004 compared to 2003. Acquisitions accounted for approximately 3% growth, sales from existing businesses provided 9% growth and favorable currency translation provided 4% growth. Sales were positively impacted by continued strength in the Gilbarco Veeder-Root retail petroleum equipment business. Gilbarco Veeder-Root delivered low double-digit growth rates for the full year 2004, but slowed to a mid-single digit growth rate on a comparable basis during the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to the fourth quarter of 2003 as a result of comparisons with the higher sales levels that began in the fourth quarter of 2003. In addition, growth rates for the first quarter of 2004 benefited from the comparison to the softness experienced in the first quarter of 2003 prior to the Iraq war. Strength in sales of retail automation and leak-detection equipment in the U.S., Europe and China were the primary drivers of the growth from existing businesses. Year-over-year growth rates in this business are expected to continue slowing in early 2005 as a result of the significant sales growth experienced in early 2004. Hach/Lange’s sales growth from existing businesses also contributed to the increase with high single-digit growth. Hach/Lange achieved higher- than-market growth in both the laboratory and process instrumentation markets in both the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, Europe, and also experienced continued strength in China. The Company’s Hach Ultra Analytics business reported accelerated growth in the second half of 2004 driven by strong U.S. and Asian sales. The business continues to benefit from strength in the electronics and food and beverage end markets. The acquisition of Trojan Technologies in November 2004 establishes the business line’s drinking and waste water disinfection market position and is expected to generate approximately $100 million in incremental sales for the business in 2005. Electronic Test. Electronic test sales, representing approximately 28% of segment sales in 2004, grew 19.5% during 2004 compared to 2003. Acquisitions accounted for approximately 7.5% growth, revenues from existing businesses provided 8.5% growth and favorable currency translation provided 3.5% growth. Year-over-year growth rates in the second half of 2004 (on a days-adjusted basis) declined somewhat from the rates reported in the first half of 2004. The decline is the result of lapping stronger sales quarters which began for this business in the second half of 2003 as well as a result of the expiration of a multi-year resale agreement relating to a low-margin product line. Growth resulted from strength in the U.S. industrial channel, the European electrical channel and overall strong growth in China. The Company’s network-test business achieved 20% growth during the year, reflecting continued strength in network analysis, copper and fiber equipment sales and strong enterprise market share gains. The business also benefited from delivery of a large order in the fourth quarter of 2004 for test equipment to service a telecommunication customer’s next generation service offerings. 17 Table of Contents Medical Technology. Medical technology represented approximately 23% of segment sales in 2004. All of this sales growth represents acquisition related growth as this line of business was established in 2004 with the acquisitions of Radiometer, Gendex and KaVo. Radiometer’s critical care diagnostics business experienced growth across all major geographies, driven by strong instrument placements and related accessory sales. Radiometer’s high single digit sales growth was somewhat offset by the KaVo and Gendex dental unit business, which was impacted by significant pre-acquisition sales incentive programs in the United States and Japan implemented by the former owners. 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 Segment Overview Sales of the Professional Instrumentation segment increased 14.5% in 2003 compared to 2002. Acquisitions provided an 8.0% increase in segment sales due primarily to the acquisitions of Gilbarco and Raytek in 2002 as well as the impact of several smaller acquisitions. Sales from existing businesses for this segment were up approximately 1.0% in 2003 compared to 2002, principally from sales increases in the Company’s environmental businesses. Prices were essentially flat compared to 2002. Favorable currency translation impact generated 5.5% growth in 2003 compared to 2002. Operating profit margins for the segment were 18.7% in 2003 compared to 17.8% in 2002. Operating profit margins for 2002 included approximately 40 basis points of benefit associated with gains on the sale of real estate and adjustments to the restructuring reserves established in 2001. The overall improvement in operating profit margins was driven primarily by ongoing cost reductions associated with the Company’s DBS initiatives completed during 2003 and margin improvements in recently acquired businesses. Business Overview Environmental. Sales from the Company’s environmental businesses, representing approximately 65% of segment sales in 2003, increased approximately 15.5% in 2003 compared to 2002. Acquisitions completed in 2002 and 2003 accounted for approximately 7.5% growth, sales from existing businesses provided 2% growth and favorable currency translation provided 6% growth. Operations were impacted by strength in the second half of 2003 in the Gilbarco Veeder-Root retail petroleum equipment business, resulting in part from market-share gains in the U.S. due to the addition of a number of distributors as a result of financial difficulties of a competitor. Increased sales to high-volume retailers and strong year-end purchasing activity from major oil companies with respect to both retail automation and environmental systems also contributed to the strength in the second half of 2003. Sales from existing businesses in the Company’s water quality businesses also contributed to the increase as strength in laboratory instrumentation sales in Europe was partially offset by softness in the U.S. laboratory instrumentation and ultrapure markets due to weakness in the semiconductor and electrical assembly markets and due to several large contracts in 2002 not repeating in 2003. Electronic Test. Electronic test sales, representing approximately 35% of 2003’s segment sales, grew 13% during 2003 compared to 2002. Acquisitions, principally the Raytek Corporation acquisition, completed in August 2002, provided 9% growth, which includes strong sales of Raytek’s non-contact temperature measurement and thermal imaging products. Favorable currency translation provided 5% growth. These factors were partially offset by an approximate 1% decline in sales from existing businesses due primarily to softness in telecommunications and data network markets. The Company’s network-test business strengthened in the second half of 2003, compared to the first half of 2003, to post low-single digit declines for the year. INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES Businesses in the Industrial Technologies segment manufacture products and sub-systems that are typically incorporated by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) into various end-products and systems, as well by customers and systems integrators into production and packaging lines. Many of the businesses also provide services to support their products, including helping customers integrate and install the products and helping ensure product uptime. The Industrial Technologies segment encompasses two strategic businesses, Motion and Product Identification, and three focused niche businesses: Power Quality, Aerospace and Defense, and Sensors & Controls. These businesses produce and sell product identification equipment and consumables; motion, position, speed, temperature, and level instruments and sensing devices; power switches and controls; power protection products; liquid flow and quality measuring devices; safety devices; and electronic and mechanical counting and controlling devices. 18 Table of Contents Industrial Technologies Segment Selected Financial Data Operating Performance For the years ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Sales $ 2,667.3 $ 2,180.7 $ 1,709.1 Operating profit 393.5 316.8 242.3 Operating profit as a % of sales 14.8 % 14.5 % 14.2 % Components of Sales Growth 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 Existing businesses 9.0 % 3.0 % Acquisition 10.5 % 20.0 % Impact of foreign currency 3.0 % 4.5 % Total 22.5 % 27.5 % 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 Segment Overview Sales of the Industrial Technologies segment increased approximately 22.5% in 2004 compared to 2003. Sales from existing businesses for this segment contributed approximately 9% to the overall growth compared to 2003, driven by sales increases in all businesses with particularly strong sales increases in the Company’s motion businesses. Price increases, which are included in sales from existing businesses, were negligible compared to 2003. Acquisitions contributed approximately 10.5% to the growth during the year driven in large part by acquisitions within the Company’s product identification business. The impact of favorable currency translation generated approximately 3% growth compared to 2003. Operating profit margins for the segment were 14.8% in 2004 compared to 14.5% in 2003. The overall improvement in operating profit margins for 2004 was driven primarily by additional leverage from sales growth, on-going cost reductions associated with Danaher Business System initiatives and reductions in manufacturing costs through low-cost region sourcing and production initiatives implemented during 2004 and 2003. Margin improvements were partially offset by lower margins associated with the start-up stage of new business initiatives with certain OEMs in the Company’s motion business. Business Overview Motion. Sales in the Company’s motion businesses, representing approximately 36% of 2004’s segment sales, grew 20% in 2004 compared to 2003, as sales from existing businesses contributed 13% to the overall reported growth, acquisitions provided growth of 3.5% and favorable currency translation effects provided 3.5% growth. The growth in sales from existing businesses continued to be broad-based, both geographically and across the markets served. The North American market for direct drive products, and the worldwide semiconductor and flat-panel display markets demonstrated particular strength during 2004 and contributed significantly to the businesses’ overall growth. Some general signs of softening in the semiconductor and electronic assembly end markets served by the motion businesses have tempered management’s growth expectations with respect to these businesses for 2005. The business has experienced a significant increase in sales associated with electric vehicle projects won in prior periods and believes it has captured market share in 2004 as many motion control applications have shifted to the use of AC motor technology solutions. The Company’s linear actuator product businesses continued to grow in 2004, primarily resulting from strong market growth for ball screw and gearbox product offerings in both North America and Europe. Growth rates in 2005 are expected to decline from the rates experienced in 2004 as the business begins to compare against these very strong 2004 sales levels and also because of the softening in the semiconductor and electronic assembly end markets referred to above. 19 Table of Contents Product Identification. The product identification business accounted for approximately 25% of segment revenues in 2004. For 2004, product identification revenues grew 38.5% compared to 2003, with acquisitions providing 29% growth, favorable currency impacts of approximately 3.5%, and sales from existing operations providing 6% growth. Growth in sales from existing businesses was broad-based across the product portfolio. The growth was driven by strong equipment sales, primarily continuous ink-jet printer sales in China and North America, but increasingly in the laser, thermal transfer overprint and binary array product offerings. Year-over-year growth rates for the second half of 2004 were somewhat lower compared with the growth rates in the first half of 2004 reflecting the normalization of revenues associated with the 2003 Willett acquisition as well as continued integration activities related to recent acquisitions. The newly acquired reading and scanning business also experienced growth, primarily from systems installation projects with the United States Postal Service. The January 2005 acquisition of Linx Printing Technologies PLC, a UK-based coding and marking business adds new distribution channels in key markets such as Germany, Japan and the United States. Linx had revenues of approximately $93 million in 2004. Focused Niche Businesses. The segment’s niche businesses in the aggregate showed 16% sales growth in 2004, primarily from high-single digit growth from existing businesses, largely attributable to the Company’s Sensors & Controls and Aerospace & Defense businesses, and to a lesser extent due to the impact of acquisitions in the Company’s Aerospace and Defense businesses. 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 Segment Overview Sales of the Industrial Technologies segment increased 27.5% in 2003 compared to 2002. The fourth quarter 2002 acquisition of Thomson Industries and the 2003 acquisition of Willett International Limited (“Willett”), together with several other smaller acquisitions provided a 20.0% increase in segment sales. This increase was in addition to an approximate 4.5% favorable currency translation impact. Sales from existing businesses for this segment were up approximately 3.0% in 2003 compared to 2002, principally from sales increases in the motion, and product identification businesses. Prices were essentially flat in 2003 compared to 2002. Operating profit margins for the segment were 14.5% in 2003 compared to 14.2% in 2002. Operating profit margins for 2002 included approximately 40 basis points of benefit associated with gains on the sale of real estate and adjustments to the restructuring reserves established in 2001. The overall improvement in operating profit margins was driven primarily by on-going cost reductions associated with the Company’s DBS initiatives completed during 2003, and margin improvements in recently acquired businesses, which typically have higher cost structures than the Company’s existing operations. Business Overview Motion. Sales in the Company’s motion businesses, representing approximately 37% of 2003’s segment sales, grew 33% in 2003 compared to 2002, as acquisitions provided growth of 21% (primarily from the Thomson Industries acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2002) and favorable currency translation effects provided 8% growth to drive this increase. The existing businesses’ sales accounted for 4% growth, reflecting share gains in certain of its end markets, including electric vehicles and direct drives, partially offset by year-over-year low-single digit declines in the Company’s linear actuator product businesses resulting from integration of the sales channels associated with the Thomson acquisition. The Company’s linear actuator businesses showed low-single digit growth in the fourth quarter which represented the first quarter of growth for this business in 2003, due to increased shipments for military programs as well as increased sales to the Company’s distribution network. Product Identification. In February 2002, the Company established its Product Identification business with the acquisition of Videojet Technologies. In January 2003 Willett was added to this business and Accu-Sort Systems, Inc. was acquired in November 2003. The Product Identification business accounted for approximately 22% of segment sales in 2003. For 2003, Product Identification sales grew 65% compared to 2002, with the Willett and Accu-Sort acquisitions providing 55% growth, favorable currency impacts of approximately 5%, and existing operations providing 5% growth, based largely on broad based equipment sales increases. Focused Niche Businesses. The segment’s niche businesses in the aggregate showed high-single digit sales growth in 2003, primarily from acquisitions in the Company’s Aerospace and Defense and Sensors and Controls businesses. TOOLS & COMPONENTS The Tools & Components segment is one of the largest domestic producers and distributors of general purpose and specialty mechanics’ hand tools. Other products manufactured by the businesses in this segment include toolboxes and storage devices; diesel engine retarders; wheel service equipment; drill chucks; custom-designed headed tools and components; and high-quality precision socket screws, fasteners, and miniature precision parts. 20 Table of Contents Tools & Components Selected Financial Data For the years ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Sales $ 1,306.3 $ 1,197.2 $ 1,192.1 Operating profit 198.3 173.8 181.4 Operating profit as a % of sales 15.2 % 14.5 % 15.2 % Components of Sales Growth 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 Existing businesses 9.5 % 0.5 % Divestiture (0.5 )% — Impact of foreign currency — — Total 9.0 % 0.5 % 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 Sales in the Tools & Components segment grew 9% in 2004 compared to 2003. Sales volumes from existing businesses contributed 9.5% and were offset slightly by the impact of a small divestiture during the year. There were no acquisitions in this segment during either 2004 or 2003. Price increases, which are included in sales from existing businesses, contributed less than 1% to reported revenue. Currency impacts on revenues were negligible. Sales in the Mechanics Hand Tools business, representing approximately two-thirds of segment sales in 2004, grew approximately 8.5% for the year, driven primarily by increases in sales from the group’s retail hand tool product lines, mobile distribution business and industrial distribution businesses. Sell-through at the group’s major retail customer was in line with the group’s sales to this customer during the period. The Company’s Matco business grew at low double-digit rates for 2004 which the Company believes outpaced the overall market growth. The Company’s engine retarder and chuck businesses also experienced low double-digit growth rates. The other niche businesses within the segment also experienced mid to high-single digit growth rates during 2004. Operating profit margins for the segment were 15.2% in 2004 compared to 14.5% in 2003. This improvement was driven by leverage on increased sales volume and the impact of cost reduction programs implemented in 2003 and 2004 offset partially by increases in price and surcharges related to steel purchases incurred in the third quarter. Price increases have been implemented to recover a portion of the increase in raw material costs. The Company announced a plant closing in the fourth quarter of 2004 which reduced overall operating profit for 2004 by about $5 million. Completing the plant closure is expected to cost approximately $6 million in 2005 and as a result there will be minimal benefit to operating margins from this closure in 2005. The Company does not expect this closure to have a positive contribution to earnings until 2006. 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 Sales in the Tools & Components segment grew approximately 0.5% in 2003. All of this growth represents growth in sales volume from existing businesses, as there were no acquisitions in this segment during either 2002 or 2003. Price and currency impacts on sales were negligible. Mechanics Hand Tools sales, representing approximately two-thirds of segment sales in 2003, grew approximately 3.5% for the year, driven primarily by increases in sales from the group’s retail hand tool product lines which rebounded in the second half of 2003 as sales to the group’s largest customer strengthened through the third and fourth quarters of 2003. In addition, both the Company’s Matco and Asian distribution channels showed growth for 2003. Offsetting these increases was a net sales decline in the segment’s niche businesses, as weakness in shipments of truck and industrial boxes, drill chucks and pole-line hardware driven by weak end markets and increased competition from low-cost competitors was partially offset by revenue 21 Table of Contents gains in the Company’s wheel service equipment product lines. Also, sales of diesel engine retarders fell during 2003, reflecting decreased end-user demand as compared to 2002. In 2002, the business experienced an inventory build-up by customers in advance of regulatory changes implemented in 2002. Operating profit margins for the segment were 14.5% in 2003 compared to 15.2% in 2002. Operating profit margins in 2002 benefited by 10 basis points from the reversal of unutilized accruals established for the 2001 restructuring program. Margin improvements at the Jacobs Chuck business unit related to the 2001 restructuring program, and other cost reductions, were offset by margin declines at the Delta Industries business unit related to the volume decrease noted above, the impact of lower engine retarder sales, and by spending on certain cost reduction and growth opportunities. GROSS PROFIT For the years ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Sales $ 6,889.3 $ 5,293.9 $ 4,577.2 Cost of sales 3,996.6 3,154.8 2,791.2 Gross profit $ 2,892.7 $ 2,139.1 $ 1,786.0 Gross profit margin 42.0 % 40.4 % 39.0 % Gross profit margins for 2004 improved 160 basis points to 42.0% compared to 40.4% in 2003. This improvement results primarily from leverage on increased sales volume. In addition, gross profit margins were impacted by generally higher gross profit margins in businesses acquired (principally Radiometer) and the ongoing cost improvements in existing business units driven by the Company’s Danaher Business System processes and low-cost region sourcing and production initiatives. Increases in cost and surcharges related to steel purchases partially offset these improvements. While gross profit margins improved in 2004 for the reasons stated above, these improvements could be negatively affected in future periods by higher raw material costs and supply constraints resulting from the improved overall economy or by any significant slowdown in the economy. As indicated above, price increases have been implemented to recover some of the increases in raw material costs experienced in 2004. Gross profit margin for 2003 was 40.4%, an increase of 140 basis points compared to 39.0% in 2002. This increase results from the benefits of the 2001 restructuring program, on-going cost improvements in existing business units driven by the Company’s Danaher Business System processes, generally higher gross profit margins in businesses acquired, cost reductions in business units acquired during the first quarter of 2002 and the leverage created from higher revenues during the year. The Company’s restructuring program announced in the fourth quarter of 2001 was estimated to have provided approximately $38 million of savings to the full year 2003 when compared against the 2001 period and $19 million when compared against the 2002 period. This restructuring was complete at the beginning of 2003. OPERATING EXPENSES For the years ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Sales $ 6,889.3 $ 5,293.9 $ 4,577.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,795.7 1,316.4 1,097.4 SG&A as a % of sales 26.1 % 24.9 % 24.0 % In 2004, selling, general and administrative expenses were 26.1% of sales, an increase of 120 basis points from 2003 levels. This increase is due primarily to additional spending to fund growth opportunities and cost reduction opportunities throughout the Company, the impact of newly acquired businesses (principally Radiometer and KaVo) and their higher relative operating expense structures, and the increased proportion of sales derived from the Company’s international operations which generally have higher operating expense structures compared to the Company as a whole. 22 Table of Contents In 2003, selling, general and administrative expenses were 24.9% of sales, an increase of 90 basis points from 2002 levels. This increase is due primarily to additional spending to fund growth opportunities throughout the Company, as well as the impact of newly acquired businesses and their higher relative operating expense structures. GAIN ON PENSION PLAN CURTAILMENT The Company recorded a curtailment gain in 2003 as a result of freezing substantially all associates’ ongoing participation in its Cash Balance Plan effective December 31, 2003. The gain totaled $22.5 million ($14.6 million after tax, or $0.05 per share) and represents the unrecognized benefits associated with prior plan amendments that were being amortized into income over the remaining service period of the participating associates prior to freezing the plan. As discussed in more detail below, the Company will continue recording pension expense related to this plan, primarily representing interest costs on the accumulated benefit obligation and amortization of actuarial losses accumulated in the plan prior to the above curtailment. INTEREST COSTS AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS For a description of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness, please refer to “–Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities and Indebtedness” below. Interest expense of $55 million in 2004 was approximately $4 million lower than the corresponding 2003 period. The decrease in interest expense is due primarily to the cessation of amortization of deferred financing costs related to the Company’s LYONS, offset slightly by the unfavorable impact of the Euro/US Dollar exchange rate on interest expense related to the Company’s $406.8 million of 6.25% Eurobond notes due 2005. Interest expense of $59 million in 2003 was approximately $5 million higher than the corresponding 2002 period. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to the unfavorable impact of the Euro/US Dollar exchange rate on interest expense related to the Company’s Eurobond notes due 2005 partially offset by reduced debt levels resulting from net repayments of approximately $146 million of outstanding indebtedness during 2003. Interest income of $7.6 million, $10.1 million and $10.3 million was recognized in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Average invested cash balances decreased in 2004 compared with the levels of 2003 due to employing these cash balances to complete several acquisitions. The decline in interest income as a result of these lower invested cash balances was partially offset by the Company maintaining a higher proportion of available cash in international markets which have higher overall interest rates and higher short-term rates in 2004. Average invested cash balances grew during 2002 and 2003, but have been largely offset by lower average interest rates earned on these deposits. INCOME TAXES The Company’s effective tax rate may be affected by business acquisitions and dispositions, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, material audit assessments and changes in tax laws. The tax effect of significant unusual items or changes in tax regulations are reflected in the period in which they occur. The Company’s effective tax rate differed from the United States federal statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of lower effective tax rates on certain earnings from operations outside of the United States. United States income taxes have not been provided on earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States and the amount of United States income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the Company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings. As of December 31, 2004, the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States was approximately $1.6 billion. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) provides the Company with an opportunity to repatriate up to $500 million of foreign earnings during 2005 at an effective US tax rate of 5.25%. At the present time, the Company has no intention to repatriate any foreign earnings under the provisions of the Act. The company will continue to re-evaluate its position throughout the year, especially if there are changes or proposed changes in foreign tax laws or in the US taxation of international businesses. The 2004 effective tax rate of 29.5% was 3.1% lower than the 2003 effective rate, mainly due to the effect of a higher proportion of non-U.S. earnings in 2004 compared to 2003 as well as the impact of changes made to the Company’s international tax structure, primarily related to the acquisition and integration of Radiometer and KaVo during 2004. The Company expects to further reduce its effective tax rate for 2005 to 27.5% reflecting the continuing benefit of deriving an increasing proportion of the Company’s earnings from international operations. The 2003 effective tax rate of 32.6% was 1.4% lower than the 2002 effective rate, mainly due to the effect of a higher proportion of foreign earnings in 2003 compared to 2002 and the impact of additional research and experimentation credits available to reduce the U.S. tax liabilities. The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. The Company believes that is has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the Company’s estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are determined or resolved. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which the Company’s earnings and/or deductions are realized may differ from current estimates. 23 Table of Contents INFLATION The effect of inflation on the Company’s operations has been minimal in 2004, 2003, and 2002. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk, which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company manages its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. In addition, the Company’s broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole. Interest Rate Risk The fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates. The value of this debt is subject to change as a result of movements in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to evaluate this potential impact. Based on a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis-point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2004, the market value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt would decrease by approximately $13 million. This methodology has certain limitations, and these hypothetical gains or losses would not be reflected in the Company’s results of operations or financial condition under current accounting principles. In January 2002, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the $250 million aggregate principal amount of 6% notes due 2008 having an aggregate notional principal amount of $100 million whereby the effective interest rate on $100 million of these notes is the six month LIBOR rate plus approximately 0.425%. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended, the Company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges. These instruments qualify as “effective” or “perfect” hedges. Other than the above noted swap arrangements, there were no material derivative financial instrument transactions during any of the periods presented. Additionally, the Company does not have significant commodity contracts or derivatives. Exchange Rate Risk The Company has a number of manufacturing sites throughout the world and sells its products globally. As a result, it is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the United States dollar and against the currencies of countries in which it manufactures and sells products and services. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. The Company’s issuance of Eurobond notes in 2000 provides a natural hedge to a portion of the Company’s European net asset position. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its foreign operations without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, interest rate swap agreements and trade accounts receivable. The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to its financial instruments. The Company anticipates, however, that counter parties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under these instruments. The Company places cash and temporary investments and its interest rate swap agreements with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world, and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company does not obtain collateral or other security to support these financial instruments, it does periodically evaluate the credit standing of the counter party financial institutions. In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to the diversity of its customers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial conditions and obtains collateral or other security when appropriate. 24 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity For the years ended, December 31, ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Total operating cash flows $ 1,033.2 $ 861.5 $ 710.3 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (115.9 ) (80.3 ) (65.4 ) Cash paid for acquisitions (1,591.7 ) (312.3 ) (1,158.1 ) Other sources 74.0 24.5 79.0 Net cash used in investing activities (1,633.6 ) (368.1 ) (1,144.5 ) Proceeds from the issuance of common stock 45.9 50.5 512.1 Proceeds (repayments) of borrowings, net (66.3 ) (145.5 ) 17.7 Dividends paid (17.7 ) (15.3 ) (13.5 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (38.1 ) (110.3 ) 516.3 • Operating cash flow, a key source of the Company’s liquidity was $1,033 million for 2004, an increase of $172 million, or approximately 20% as compared to 2003. Earnings growth contributed $209 million to the increase in operating cash flow in 2004 compared to 2003, which was somewhat offset by year-over-year changes in working capital as discussed below. • As of December 31, 2004, the Company held approximately $609 million of cash and cash equivalents. • Acquisitions constituted the most significant use of cash in all periods presented. The Company acquired thirteen companies and product lines during 2004 for total consideration of approximately $1.6 billion in cash, including transaction costs. • The Company’s Eurobond notes mature July 2005. The Company currently anticipates that at maturity the Eurobond notes will be satisfied from available cash, through the issuance of commercial paper, borrowings under existing credit facilities or by accessing the capital markets, or through a combination of some or all of these alternatives. Operating Activities The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position, with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. Operating cash flow, a key source of the Company’s liquidity, was $1,033 million for 2004, an increase of $172 million, or approximately 20% as compared to 2003. Earnings growth contributed $209 million to the increase in operating cash flow in 2004 compared to 2003. In addition, additional deferred taxes related to 2004’s earnings contributed approximately $19 million to the change in operating cash flows and depreciation and amortization contributed approximately $23 million to the improvement in cash flow on a year-over year basis. Operating working capital, which the company defines as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable, unfavorably impacted the year-over-year comparison between 2004 and 2003 as accounts receivable increased to support the higher sales the company experienced in 2004. Operating working capital still made an overall positive contribution to operating cash flow during 2004 due to continued emphasis on inventory management. Inventory levels decreased approximately $65 million in 2004 versus 2003 reflecting these efforts in both newly acquired businesses as well as the Company’s existing operations. These improvements were partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses associated with the timing of payments for certain of the Company’s benefit programs, including 401(k) and employee health plan contributions. 25 Table of Contents In connection with its acquisitions, the Company records appropriate accruals for the costs of closing duplicate facilities, severing redundant personnel and integrating the acquired businesses into existing Company operations. Cash flows from operating activities are reduced by the amounts expended against the various accruals established in connection with each acquisition. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion in 2004 compared to approximately $368 million of net cash used in 2003. Gross capital spending of $116 million for 2004 increased $36 million from 2003, due to capital spending relating to new acquisitions and spending related to the Company’s low-cost region manufacturing initiatives, new products and other growth opportunities. Net cash used in investing activities was $368 million in 2003 compared to approximately $1.1 billion of net cash used in 2002. Gross capital spending of $80 million for 2003 increased $15 million from 2002, due to capital spending relating to new acquisitions and spending related to the Company’s low-cost region sourcing initiatives. Capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacement of equipment and improving information technology systems. In 2005, the Company expects capital spending of approximately $150 million, although actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions. Disposals of fixed assets yielded approximately $31 million and $13 million of cash proceeds for 2004 and 2003. In addition, as discussed below, the Company completed several business acquisitions and divestitures during 2004, 2003 and 2002. All of the acquisitions during this time period have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Company’s financial statements. This goodwill typically arises because the purchase prices for these businesses reflect the competitive nature of the process by which the businesses are acquired and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these businesses bring to existing operations. For a discussion of other factors resulting in the recognition of goodwill see Notes 2 and 5 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 2004 Acquisitions In January 2004, the Company acquired all of the share capital in Radiometer S/A for approximately $684 million in cash (net of $77 million in acquired cash), including transaction costs, pursuant to a tender offer announced on December 11, 2003. In addition, the Company assumed $66 million of debt in connection with the acquisition. Radiometer designs, manufactures, and markets a variety of blood gas diagnostic instrumentation, primarily used in hospital applications. The Company also provides consumables and services for its instruments. Radiometer is a worldwide leader in its served markets, and has total annual sales of approximately $300 million. In May 2004, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of KaVo for approximately €350 million (approximately $412 million) in cash, including transaction costs and net of $45 million in acquired cash. KaVo, headquartered in Biberach, Germany, with 2003 revenues of approximately $450 million, is a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and sale of dental equipment, including hand pieces, treatment units and diagnostic systems and laboratory equipment. This acquisition, combined with Radiometer and a smaller dental equipment business acquired earlier in 2004 are included in the Company’s Medical Technology line of business. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company acquired, pursuant to a tender offer announced on October 1, 2004, all of the outstanding shares of Trojan Technologies, Inc. for aggregate consideration of approximately $185 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of $23 million in acquired cash. In addition, the Company assumed $4 million of debt in connection with the acquisition. Trojan is a leader in the ultraviolet disinfection market for drinking and wastewater applications and has annual revenues of approximately $115 million. In addition to Radiometer, KaVo and Trojan, the Company acquired ten smaller companies and product lines during 2004 for total consideration of approximately $311 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired. In general, each company is a manufacturer and assembler of instrumentation products, in markets such as medical technology, electronic test, motion, environmental, product identification, sensors and controls, and aerospace and defense. These companies were all acquired to complement existing businesses or as additions to the newly formed Medical Technology line of business within the Professional Instrumentation segment. The aggregate annual sales of these acquired businesses is approximately $280 million. In addition, the company sold a business that was part of the Tools & Components segment during 2004. This business was insignificant to reported sales and earnings. Proceeds from this sale have been included in proceeds from divestitures in the accompanying consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $1.5 million is included in gain on sale of real estate and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 2003 Acquisitions The Company acquired twelve companies and product lines during 2003 for total consideration of approximately $312 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired. The Company also assumed debt with an estimated fair market value of approximately $45 million in connection with these acquisitions. In connection with one of the 2003 acquisitions, the Company entered into an agreement to pay an additional maximum contingent consideration of up to $36.8 million in November 2008 based on future performance of the acquired business through November 2008. In general, each company is a manufacturer and assembler of environmental or instrumentation products, in markets such as product identification, environmental and aerospace and defense. 26 Table of Contents These companies were all acquired to complement existing business units of the Professional Instrumentation or Industrial Technologies segments. The aggregated annual revenue of the acquired businesses is approximately $361 million and each of these twelve companies individually has less than $125 million in annual revenues. In addition, the Company sold one facility acquired in connection with a prior acquisition for approximately $11.6 million in net proceeds. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale and the proceeds have been included in proceeds from divestitures in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 2002 Acquisitions On February 25, 2002, the Company completed the divestiture of API Heat Transfer, Inc. to an affiliate of Madison Capital Partners for approximately $63 million (including $53 million in net cash and a note receivable in the principal amount of $10 million), less certain liabilities of API Heat Transfer, Inc. paid by the Company at and subsequent to closing. On February 5, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Marconi Data Systems, formerly known as Videojet Technologies, from Marconi plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $400 million in net cash including transaction costs. On February 4, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Viridor Instrumentation Limited from the Pennon Group plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $137 million in net cash including transaction costs. On February 1, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Marconi Commerce Systems, formerly known as Gilbarco, from Marconi plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $309 million in cash including transaction costs (net of $17 million of acquired cash). On October 18, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Thomson Industries, Inc. in a stock and asset acquisition, for approximately $147 million in cash including transaction costs (net of $2 million of acquired cash), an agreement to pay $15 million over the next six years, and contingent consideration with a current maximum payout of $45 million based on the future performance of Thomson through December 31, 2005. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company acquired eight smaller companies, for total consideration of approximately $166 million in net cash including transaction costs. Recent Acquisition Developments In January 2005, the Company acquired, pursuant to a tender offer announced on October 6, 2004, approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of Linx Printing Technologies PLC, a publicly-held United Kingdom company operating in the product identification market. The Company intends to acquire the remaining outstanding shares through the compulsory acquisition provisions of the applicable UK Companies legislation. Once all of the outstanding shares are acquired, it is expected that the total consideration for such shares will be approximately $171 million in cash, including estimated transaction costs and net of cash acquired. Linx complements the Company’s product identification businesses and has annual revenue of approximately $93 million. Financing Activities and Indebtedness Financing activities used cash of $38 million during 2004 compared to $110 million used during 2003. The reduction in cash used in financing activities was directly related to lower levels of required principal repayments under the Company’s outstanding debt obligations between periods. Total debt increased to $1,350 million at December 31, 2004, compared to $1,299 million at December 31, 2003. This increase was due primarily to change in the U.S Dollar/Euro exchange rates and the resulting increase in the carrying value of the Company’s Euro denominated debt. The Company borrowed and repaid approximately $130 million in short-term borrowings under an uncommitted financing arrangement to fund the acquisition of KaVo during the second quarter of 2004. All significant debt obligations assumed related to 2004 acquisitions have been repaid. The Company’s debt financing as of December 31, 2004 was composed primarily of $567 million of zero coupon convertible notes due 2021 Liquid Yield Option Notes or LYONs (“LYONs”), $407 million of 6.25% Eurobond notes due 2005 and $250 million of 6% notes due 2008 (subject to the interest rate swaps described above). The Company’s LYONs obligations (described in further detail below) carry a yield to maturity of 2.375% (with contingent interest payable as described below). Substantially all remaining borrowings have interest costs that float with referenced base rates. The Company maintains two revolving senior unsecured credit facilities totaling $1 billion available for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the revolving credit facilities bear interest of Eurocurrency rate plus 0.21% to 0.70%, depending on the Company’s debt rating. The credit facilities, each $500 million, have a fixed term expiring June 28, 2006 and July 23, 2006, respectively. There were no borrowings outstanding under either of the Company’s credit facilities at any time during 2004. The Company’s Eurobond notes due in 2005 have been classified as a current obligation in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet since the maturity date is within one year from December 31, 2004. The Company currently anticipates that at maturity the Eurobond notes will be satisfied from available cash, through the issuance of commercial paper, borrowings under existing credit facilities or by accessing the capital markets, or through a combination of some or all of these alternatives. During the first quarter of 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in LYONs. The net proceeds to the Company were approximately $505 million, of which approximately $100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The LYONs carry a yield to maturity of 2.375%. Holders of the LYONs may convert each of their LYONs into 14.5352 shares of Danaher common stock (in the aggregate for all LYONs, approximately 12.0 million shares of Danaher common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January 22, 2021. As of December 31, 2004, 27 Table of Contents the accreted value of the outstanding LYONs was $47 per share which, at that date, was lower than the traded market value of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time. Holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash and/or Company common stock, at the Company’s option, on January 22, 2011. The holders had a similar option to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes as of January 22, 2004, which resulted in notes with an accreted value of $1.1 million being redeemed by the Company. These notes were redeemed for cash. The Company will pay contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six-month period commencing after January 22, 2004 if the average market price of a LYON for a measurement period preceding such six-month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. The Company has not and is not currently required to pay contingent interest under this agreement. Except for the contingent interest described above, the Company will not pay interest on the LYONs prior to maturity. The Company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt. However, a downgrade in the Company’s credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the Company’s credit facilities. Also, a downgrade in the Company’s credit rating could limit, or in the case of a significant downgrade, preclude the Company’s ability to consider commercial paper as a potential source of financing. Aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2004 were $17.7 million. Cash and Cash Requirements As of December 31, 2004, the Company held approximately $609 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less. As of December 31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants under the aforementioned debt instruments, including limitations on secured debt and debt levels. In addition, as of the date of this Form 10-K, the Company could issue up to $1 billion of securities under its shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures and acquisitions, to pay interest and service debt, fund its pension plans as required and to pay dividends to shareholders. In order to meet these cash requirements, the Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds. The Company currently anticipates that any additional acquisitions consummated during 2005 would be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and, if necessary, through the establishment of a commercial paper program, through borrowings under its credit facilities, under uncommitted lines of credit or by accessing the capital markets. The Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy both short-term and long-term requirements. The Company’s cash balances are generated and held in numerous locations throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside the United States. Most of the amounts held outside the United States could be repatriated to the United States, but, under current law, would potentially be subject to United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws. Where local restrictions prevent an efficient inter-company transfer of funds, the Company’s intent is that cash balances would remain in the foreign country and it would meet United States liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both. The Company utilizes a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that its worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. Pension Fund Assets and Liabilities Due to declines in the equity markets in 2001 and 2002, the fair value of the Company’s pension fund assets decreased below the accumulated benefit obligation due to the participants in the plan. As a result, in accordance with SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions”, the Company recorded a minimum pension liability reduction of $6.9 million (net of tax expense of $3.7 million) at December 31, 2004. The minimum pension liability is calculated as the difference between the actuarially determined accumulated benefit obligation and the value of the plan assets as of September 30, 2004 (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004 for additional information). This adjustment results in a direct credit to stockholders’ equity and does not immediately impact net earnings, but is included in other comprehensive income. Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in such calculations. These assumptions include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may affect the Company’s financial position or results of operations. The Company used a 5.75% discount rate in computing the amount of the minimum pension liability to be recorded at December 31, 2004, which represented a decrease in the discount rate of 0.25% from the rate used at December 31, 2003. A further 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the after-tax minimum pension liability approximately $14 million from the amount recorded in the financial statements at December 31, 2004. For 2004, the Company estimated the expected long-term rate of return assumption at 8.5% which is consistent with the rate used in 2003. This expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected long-term returns on equity and debt 28 Table of Contents investments included in plan assets. The plan maintains between 60% to 70% of its assets in equity portfolios, which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities. The balance of the asset portfolio is invested in corporate bonds and bond index funds. Pension expense for this plan for the year ended December 31, 2004 was approximately $4.3 million (or $3.0 million on an after-tax basis), compared with $8.5 million (or $5.7 million on an after-tax basis and excluding the $22.5 million gain on curtailment recognized in 2003) for this plan in 2003. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was reduced by an additional 50 basis points, pension expense for 2004 would have increased approximately $2.4 million (or $ 1.7 million on an after-tax basis). The Company intends on lowering the assumed rate of return on plan assets to 8.0% for 2005. The Company was not statutorily required to make contributions to the plan in 2004 and anticipates there will be no statutory funding requirements for the defined benefit plan in 2005. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004 under (1) long-term debt obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company’s balance sheet under GAAP.

(e) Primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies and allowances, performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs, self-insurance and litigation claims, post-retirement benefits, certain pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities and deferred compensation liabilities. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations are based upon management’s estimates over the terms of these agreements and are largely based upon historical experience. 29 Table of Contents OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of certain off-balance sheet commercial commitments of the Company. Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period TotalAmountsCommitted Less Than One Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years (in millions) Standby Letters of Credit and Performance Bonds $ 137.1 $ 95.2 $ 35.2 $ 6.3 $ 0.4 Guarantees 49.2 43.9 1.6 — 3.7 Contingent Acquisition Consideration 95.0 10.0 39.0 46.0 — Total $ 281.3 $ 149.1 $ 75.8 $ 52.3 $ 4.1 Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are generally issued to secure the Company’s obligations under short-term contracts to purchase raw materials and components for manufacture and for performance under specific manufacturing agreements. Guarantees reflected in the table above primarily relate to the Company’s Matco subsidiary, which has sold, with recourse, or provided credit enhancements for certain of its accounts receivable and notes receivable. This program has been used to assist Matco’s customers in obtaining initial start-up financing for their franchise. Amounts outstanding under this program approximated $29 million as of December 31, 2004. The subsidiary accounts for such sales in accordance with SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities—a replacement of SFAS No. 125.” A provision for estimated losses as a result of the recourse has been included in accrued expenses. No gain or loss arose from these transactions. In connection with three separate past acquisitions, the Company has entered into agreements with the respective sellers to pay certain amounts in the future as additional purchase price. The Company could pay nothing in the aggregate over the next five years pursuant to these agreements, or a maximum of up to $95.0 million over the next five years depending on the future performance of the respective businesses. The Company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as environmental liabilities and tax liabilities. The Company cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations, warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the Company does not believe that the liabilities relating to these representations, warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Due to the Company’s downsizing of certain operations pursuant to acquisitions, restructuring plans or otherwise, certain properties leased by the Company have been sublet to third parties. In the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by such sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Except as described above, the Company has not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements as of December 31, 2004. Also, the Company does not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities as of December 31, 2004. Other Contingent Liabilities Certain of the Company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. The Company must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the United States and abroad in connection with its operations. In addition to the environmental compliance costs, the Company may incur costs related to alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. The Company has projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities, in both the United States and abroad, to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the factors described above under Item 1. Business—Environmental and Safety Regulations. In addition, the Company is from time to time 30 Table of Contents party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. In view of the Company’s financial position and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, the Company believes that its liability, if any, related to past or current waste disposal practices and other hazardous material handling practices will not have a material adverse effect on its cash flow or financial condition. In addition, the ongoing cost of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations has not had, and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows, capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Certain of the Company’s products are medical devices that are subject to regulation by the FDA and by the counterpart agencies of the foreign countries where the products are sold, as well as federal, state and local regulations governing the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with these regulations. The Company is also required to comply with various export control and economic sanctions laws. Non-United States governments have also implemented similar export control regulations, which may affect Company operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with applicable regulations governing such export control and economic sanctions laws. Please refer to Note 10 to the consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual Report for information regarding certain outstanding litigation matters. In addition, the Company is, from time to time, subject to routine litigation incidental to its business. These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Company’s products, allegations of patent and trademark infringement and trade secret misappropriation, and litigation and administrative proceedings involving employment matters and commercial disputes. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages. While the Company maintains workers compensation, property, cargo, auto, product, general liability, and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (and have acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions) that it believes covers a portion of these claims, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to protect the Company against potential loss exposures. In addition, while the Company believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims, these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to protect the Company against potential loss exposures. The Company believes that the results of these litigation matters will not have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s cash flows or financial condition, even before taking into account any related insurance recoveries. The Company carries significant deductibles and self-insured retentions for workers’ compensation, property, automobile, product and general liability costs, and management believes that the Company maintains adequate accruals to cover the retained liability. Management determines the Company’s accrual for self-insurance liability based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. The company maintains third party insurance policies up to certain limits to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts. The Company’s Certificate of Incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the Company, or by reason of such director or officer serving any other entity at the request of the Company, subject to limited exceptions. While the Company maintains insurance for this type of liability, any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect management’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounts receivable. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company’s customers to make required payments. The Company estimates its anticipated losses from doubtful accounts based on historical collection history as well as by specifically reserving for known doubtful accounts. Estimating losses from doubtful accounts is inherently uncertain because the amount of such losses depends substantially on the financial condition of the Company’s customers, and the Company typically has limited visibility as to the specific financial state of its customers. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate beyond estimates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, the Company would be required to write off additional accounts receivable balances, which would adversely impact the Company’s net earnings and financial condition. 31 Table of Contents Inventories. The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market. The Company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand, technological advances and pricing competition in many of the Company’s markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the Company’s control. As a result, such fluctuations can be difficult to predict. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, the Company would be required to reduce the value of its inventory, which would adversely impact the Company’s net earnings and financial condition. Acquired intangibles. The Company’s business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the Company will incur. The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, the accounting standard for goodwill, which requires that the Company, on an annual basis, calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists. Impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status. In calculating the fair value of the reporting units, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. If actual fair value is less than the Company’s estimates, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings. Long-lived assets. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. Judgments made by the Company relate to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and its ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets and are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and anticipated future cash flows. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of long-lived assets, there is risk that the carrying value of the Company’s long-lived assets may require adjustment in future periods. If actual fair value is less than the Company’s estimates, long-lived assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of the Company’s reporting units as of October 2, 2004, the annual testing date, ranged from approximately $138 million to approximately $2.6 billion. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 10% decrease excluding the recently acquired Medical Technology reporting unit, would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $108 million to approximately $2.3 billion for each of the Company’s reporting units. Purchase accounting. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company formulates a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 95-3, “Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination”, the Company accrues estimates for certain of the integration costs anticipated at the date of acquisition, including personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings. Adjustments to these estimates are made up to 12 months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized. The Company establishes these accruals based on information obtained during the due diligence process, the Company’s experience in acquiring other companies, and information obtained after the closing about the acquired company’s business, assets and liabilities. The accruals established by the Company are inherently uncertain because they are based on limited information on the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired business as well as the uncertainty of the cost to execute the integration plans for the business. If the accruals established by the Company are insufficient to account for all of the activities required to integrate the acquired entity, the Company would be required to incur an expense, which would adversely affect the Company’s results of operations. To the extent these accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose, the excess is recorded as a reduction of the purchase price, typically by reducing recorded goodwill balances. ITEM 7A.

RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as the current global economic slowdown, disruption in the financial markets and other U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Deteriorating general economic conditions and uncertainties in the global financial markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Our business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. Financial markets in the United States and abroad have experienced extreme disruption in recent months, including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability and declining valuations of investments. These disruptions are likely to have an ongoing adverse effect on the world economy. A continuing economic downturn and financial market disruptions may: • reduce demand for our products and services, increase order cancellations and result in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies; 15 Table of Contents • increase the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories; • increase price competition in our served markets; • result in supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; • increase the risk of impairment of long-lived assets due to underutilized manufacturing capacity; and • increase the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which, in addition to increasing the risks identified above, could result in preference actions against us. In addition, although we were able to continue accessing the commercial paper markets throughout 2008, there can be no assurances that the commercial paper markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facility will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these financial market and general economic developments and they could have a material adverse effect on our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility and borrow money in the credit markets or otherwise, or on the terms of such borrowings. We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may face decreased demand or price reductions for our products. Our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive. Because of the diversity of products we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors. We are facing increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of new, large companies into certain markets, the entry of competitors based in low-cost manufacturing locations, and increasing consolidation in particular markets. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services designed to maintain our brand recognition and leadership position in various product categories and penetrating new markets, including in developing countries. Our failure to compete effectively may reduce our revenues, profitability and cash flow, and pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our profitability. Our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation. We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation on a timely basis, our products will become technologically obsolete over time and our revenues, cash flow, profitability and competitive position will suffer. Our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to: • correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences; • allocate our research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects; • anticipate and respond to our competitors’ development of new products and technological innovations; • differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings; • innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets; • obtain adequate intellectual property rights; • successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and manufacture and deliver new products in sufficient volumes on time; and • encourage customers to adopt new technologies. 16 Table of Contents In addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. Our growth rate could decline if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could result in diminished demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our growth rate and profitability. Our acquisition of businesses could negatively impact our profitability and return on invested capital. As part of our business strategy we acquire businesses in the ordinary course, some of which may be material. During 2008, we acquired seventeen businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $423 million (including transaction costs and net of cash acquired); during 2007, we acquired twelve businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.6 billion (including transaction costs and net of cash acquired); and during 2006, we acquired eleven businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.7 billion (including transaction costs and net of cash acquired). Our acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, managerial and operational challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability: • Any acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it, or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable. • Acquisitions could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long term. • Acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results, particularly in light of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 141 (R), Business Combinations, which will apply to any acquisition completed in 2009 or later. Under SFAS No. 141(R), we will be required to expense a number of acquisition-related items that under previous accounting rules did not impact our income statement. • Acquisitions could place unanticipated demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. • We could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other systems. • We may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition. • We may assume by acquisition unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, or internal control deficiencies. The realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. • As a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on our balance sheet. If we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets. Any inability to consummate acquisitions at our prior rate could negatively impact our growth rate. We may not be able to consummate acquisitions at similar rates to the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate. Promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including high valuations, the recent tightening of the credit markets, competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory, including antitrust, approvals. Changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or further deterioration in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions. Our ability to grow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate companies and businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated cost savings. 17 Table of Contents The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities. Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may not be able to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position. Contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We have retained responsibility for some of the known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold, such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims and environmental matters, and have agreed to indemnify the purchasers of these businesses for certain known and unknown contingent liabilities. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition but we can not be certain that this favorable pattern will continue. Our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $2.6 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we had the ability to incur an additional $826 million of indebtedness in the form of commercial paper or bank loans under our outstanding facilities and programs. We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: • requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and stock repurchases; • reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and • exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. We may incur significantly more debt in the future. If we add new debt, the risks described above could increase. Our current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including certain restrictions on our ability to incur liens on our assets, and requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus shareholders’ equity) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of 0.65 to 1.0 or less. In addition, our long-term debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our long-lived assets. At December 31, 2008, the net carrying value of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other intangible assets and other long term assets) totaled approximately $13.3 billion. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess our long-lived assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other long-lived assets. Future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized. Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices, and also decrease our reported revenues or margins in respect of sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could have 18 Table of Contents a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased overseas. In addition, our sales and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into U.S. dollars. If we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights. We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our operations. The intellectual property rights that we obtain, however, may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. In addition, the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented or designed-around, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. Our failure or inability to obtain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property, could adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations. Third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services. From time to time, we receive notices from third parties regarding intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In the event of a successful claim against us, we could lose our rights to critical technology or be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights, any of which could adversely impact our competitive position, revenues, profitability and cash flows. Even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows. We are subject to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to a variety of litigation incidental to our business, including claims for damages arising out of the use of our products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition-related matters. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our financial condition, operations and results of operations. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. In addition, developments in legal proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, which could adversely affect our results of operations in any period. Our operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities, costs, litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and reputation. Certain of our operations, products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water and establish standards for the use, generation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the U.S. and abroad in connection with our operations. We cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in substantial compliance with environmental and health and safety laws. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 19 Table of Contents In addition, we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. For additional information regarding these risks, please refer to “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters.” We cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and reputation or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and reputation. In addition to the environmental regulations noted above, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the federal, state and local levels, including the following: • We are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons and dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies, and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory. • Certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the FDA, by counterpart agencies of other countries and by regulations governing the management, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials. Violations of these regulations, efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products can lead to warning letters, declining sales, recalls, seizures, injunctions, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, suspension or withdrawal of approvals and pre-market notification rescissions. In addition, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. • We also have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. Our agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors. Government contracts that have been awarded to us following a bid process could become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder, which could result in loss of the contract. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, the accuracy of records and the recording of costs. A failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting. In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to manufacture, import and export products and services, and damage to our reputation. Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the ISO, and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our results of operations. For additional information regarding these risks, please refer to “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters.” 20 Table of Contents Our reputation and our ability to do business may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners. We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, competition, money laundering and data privacy. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries, and could damage our reputation. Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions and tax planning strategies), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and changes in tax laws. Any of these factors may adversely affect our tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities. Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. The performance of the financial markets (particularly the equity markets) and interest rates impact our funding obligations under our defined benefit pension plans. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. The recent volatility in global capital markets has resulted in significant declines in the fair value of our pension plan assets during 2008. We have experienced and may continue to experience higher costs to produce our products as a result of rising prices for commodities. Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials, including steel, copper, cast iron, electronic components, aluminum, plastics and other petroleum-based products. Prices of oil and gas also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities. Over the last three years, the prices of raw materials have been volatile. For several types of raw materials, prices increased substantially in 2007 and 2008 before declining late in 2008. Due to the highly competitive nature of the industries which we serve and the cost-containment efforts of our customers, we may be unable to fully pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we are unable fully to recover higher raw material costs through price increases or offset these increases through other cost reductions, we could experience lower margins and profitability and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. If we cannot adjust our purchases of materials, components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changing market conditions or customer demand, our income and results of operations may suffer. We purchase materials, components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations. Our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations. During a market upturn, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices. If we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand, we may not be able to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed or our material or manufacturing costs may increase. Conversely, in order to secure supplies for the production of products, we sometimes enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer. 21 Table of Contents In addition, some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers. If these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we could face manufacturing or sourcing interruptions, delays and inefficiencies. If we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity to reflect the demand for our products, our income and results of operations may suffer. Because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed our production requirements or fall short of our production requirements. Any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results. Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as health and safety, environmental and food and drug regulations and regulations governing communications. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Any significant change in any of these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products. In addition, in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations. In these markets, the failure of governmental and other entities to adopt new regulations, or the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address, could adversely affect our growth rate. In addition, certain of our customers receive reimbursement from government insurance programs for some of the costs of the products that they purchase from us. A reduction in governmental support for healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation governing the delivery or pricing of healthcare services may cause healthcare-industry participants to purchase fewer of our products and services or to reduce the prices they are willing to pay. Work stoppages, union and works council campaigns, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force could adversely impact our results of operations and cause us to incur incremental costs. We have a number of U.S. collective bargaining units and various non-U.S. collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and potential labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations. Adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition or performance of, key distributors, resellers and other channel partners could adversely affect our results of operations. Certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors, resellers and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and end-users. Some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products, and if they favor our competitors’ products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. Adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners, or adverse developments in their financial condition or performance, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. For example, the recent economic downturn and financial market disruption has increased the possibility that one or more of our significant customers, or a group of less significant customers, could become insolvent, which could result in uncollectible accounts receivable in excess of established reserves, preference actions that would require us to repay to the bankruptcy estate payments recently received from such customer, increased obsolete inventory and impairment of long-lived assets due to underutilized manufacturing capacity. In addition, the consolidation of distributors in certain of our served industries, as well as the formation of large and sophisticated purchasing groups in industries such as healthcare, could adversely impact our profitability. 22 Table of Contents The inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully. If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified officers and other employees, we may not be able to: • effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated performance results from those businesses; • effectively implement the DANAHER BUSINESS SYSTEM throughout our organization and achieve the cost savings and other benefits that effective implementation of the DBS can achieve; and • otherwise profitably grow our business. International economic, political, legal and business factors could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In 2008, approximately 53% of our sales were derived outside the U.S. Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the U.S., we expect to continue to increase our sales outside the U.S., particularly in emerging markets. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the U.S. Our international business is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations, including: • interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers; • changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions; • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; • unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including negative changes in tax laws; • limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings; • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; • differing labor regulations; • differing protection of intellectual property; and • wars and terrorist activities and the U.S. and international response thereto. Any of these risks could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and growth. Cyclical economic conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that have historically experienced periodic downturns, which have adversely impacted demand for the equipment and services that we manufacture and market. Any competitive pricing pressures, slowdown in capital investments or other downturn in these industries could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in any given period. If we suffer loss to our facilities, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed. Our facilities, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. If any of these facilities or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate headquarters are located in Washington, D.C. in a facility that we lease. At December 31, 2008, we had 226 significant manufacturing and distribution locations worldwide, comprising approximately 21 million square feet, of which approximately 13 million square feet are owned and approximately 8 million square feet are leased. Of 23 Table of Contents these manufacturing and distribution locations, 117 facilities are located in the United States and 109 are located outside the United States, primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia, the rest of North America, Latin America and Australia. The number of manufacturing and distribution locations by business segment is: • Professional Instrumentation, 69; • Medical Technologies, 52; • Industrial Technologies, 69; and • Tools & Components, 36. We consider our facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used and do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. Please refer to Note 11 in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information with respect to our lease commitments. ITEM 3.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is designed to provide a reader of Danaher Corporation’s (“Danaher,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our”) financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of Company management. The Company’s MD&A is divided into four main sections: • Overview • Results of Operations • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Critical Accounting Policies OVERVIEW General We strive to create shareholder value through: • delivering sales growth, excluding the impact of acquired businesses, in excess of the overall market growth for our products and services; • upper quartile financial performance compared to our peer companies; and • upper quartile cash flow generation from operations compared to our peer companies. To accomplish these goals, we use a set of tools and processes, known as the DANAHER BUSINESS SYSTEM, which are designed to continuously improve business performance in critical areas of quality, delivery, cost and innovation. Within the DBS framework, we pursue a number of ongoing strategic initiatives intended to improve our performance, including initiatives relating to manufacturing improvement, idea generation, product development and commercialization and global sourcing of materials and services. To further these objectives we also acquire businesses that either strategically fit within our existing business portfolio or expand our portfolio into a new and attractive business area. We believe that many acquisition opportunities remain available within our target markets. The extent to which appropriate acquisitions are made and effectively integrated can affect our overall growth and operating results. We also continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. Danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations. In 2008, approximately 53% of Danaher’s sales were derived outside the United States. As a global business, Danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors. For example, in those industry segments where the Company is a capital equipment provider, revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of the Company’s customers, who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy. Danaher’s geographic and industry diversity, as well as the diversity of its product sales and services, typically helps limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results. However, the broad impact of the worldwide credit market turmoil and economic downturn have negatively impacted the growth rates of most of the Company’s businesses and resulted in the Company’s overall revenue from existing businesses contracting in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. Given the broad range of products manufactured and geographies served, management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the Company. The Company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future. In addition, the Company’s order rates are highly indicative of the Company’s revenue in the short term and thus a key measure of anticipated performance. Significant Acquisitions In November 2007, the Company significantly expanded its test and measurement business with the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Tektronix, Inc. for total cash consideration of approximately $2.8 billion, including transaction costs and net of cash and debt acquired. Tektronix is part of Danaher’s test and measurement business 28 Table of Contents included in the Professional Instrumentation segment. The Company funded the purchase price of the Tektronix acquisition with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and the Company’s November 2007 common stock offering, and to a lesser extent from available cash. Business Performance While differences exist among the Company’s businesses, the Company experienced overall growth during 2008 as compared to 2007. As a result of the deterioration in global economic conditions that occurred in the latter part of 2008, all of the year-over-year growth from existing businesses experienced by the Company occurred in the first nine months of the year. Demand weakened significantly in the fourth quarter resulting in a decline in revenue from existing businesses in the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Notwithstanding the fourth quarter decline, the Company’s full year growth was led by strength throughout the entire year in the Company’s environmental, acute care diagnostic and life sciences businesses. Growth from the test and measurement business during the first nine months of 2008 was partially offset by sales declines experienced in the fourth quarter due to weak demand. Sales growth was also impacted adversely in the fourth quarter 2008 due to weak demand in the Company’s industrial and consumer oriented businesses as demand slowed considerably in the dental technologies, product identification, enterprise network performance management and mechanics’ hand tools businesses. The Company continues to operate in a highly competitive business environment in most markets and geographies served. The Company’s future performance will depend on its ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities in the markets and geographies served, including contraction in most of the world’s major economies, access to funding in the global capital markets, trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force, consolidation of competitors, the expansion of market opportunities in Asia and volatility in raw material costs. The Company regularly evaluates market needs and conditions with the objective of positioning itself to provide superior products and services to its customers in a cost efficient manner. Consistent with this approach, and in light of the worsening global economic environment, the Company initiated a series of restructuring actions during the fourth quarter of 2008 to better position the Company’s cost base for future periods. Please refer to “Results of Operations—Restructuring and Other Related Charges” below for additional discussion. Although the Company has a U.S. dollar functional currency for reporting purposes, a substantial portion of its sales and profits are generated in foreign currencies. Sales and profits generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and as a result are affected by changes in exchange rates. With limited exceptions, the Company has accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Therefore, both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales, profit, and assets and liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Please refer to “Financial Instruments and Risk Management” section below for additional information. On average, the U.S. dollar weakened against other major currencies during 2008, particularly during the first half of 2008. The U.S. Dollar strengthened against other major currencies in the second half of 2008 and, as of December 31, 2008, U.S. Dollar exchange rate levels were stronger than as of the end of 2007. Currency exchange rates increased reported sales for 2008 by approximately 2.0% as compared to 2007. Given the lower overall profit margins in the Company’s European businesses, currency rate changes lowered year-over-year comparisons of reported operating profit margins. If the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2008 prevail throughout 2009, currency exchange rates will adversely impact 2009 sales and operating results relative to the Company’s performance in 2008. Additional strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would further adversely impact the Company’s sales and results of operations. Any weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would benefit the Company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis. 29 Table of Contents Outlook During the fourth quarter of 2008, worldwide credit markets and overall global economic conditions deteriorated significantly, resulting in a general decline in worldwide demand for the Company’s products and services. The economic uncertainties that continue to exist suggest that global demand will continue to contract, at least in the early months of 2009. While none of the Company’s businesses are insulated from the slowing demand, the contraction is anticipated to impact adversely certain of the Company’s businesses more than others. In particular, the Company’s industrial and consumer businesses are likely to be most impacted with the medical technologies and environmental businesses less affected. The Company expects further contraction in the industrial technologies and tools and components segments as well as portions of the test and measurement businesses. To minimize the impact of the recessionary economic conditions, as discussed below, the Company initiated restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of 2008, and will continue to assess market conditions and take actions as it deems necessary to appropriately position its businesses in light of the economic environment. The Company currently estimates additional pre-tax restructuring costs in the range of $40 to $60 million to be incurred during 2009. Consistent with past practice, the Company will also continue to actively manage working capital with a view to maximizing cash flow. Although recent distress in the financial markets has not had a significant impact on the Company’s financial position or liquidity as of the filing date of this Report, management continues to monitor the financial markets and general global economic conditions. If further changes in financial markets or other areas of the economy adversely affect the Company’s access to the commercial paper markets, the Company would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and existing committed credit facilities to provide short-term funding. Please refer to the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section for additional discussion. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated sales from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 15.0% over the comparable period of 2007. Sales from existing businesses contributed 2.5% growth, acquisitions contributed 10.5% growth and currency translation provided 2.0% growth. The majority of the growth related to currency translation occurred during the first nine months of 2008, as currency translation adversely impacted results in the fourth quarter of 2008. References in this report to sales from existing businesses include sales from acquired businesses starting from and after the first anniversary of the acquisition, but exclude currency effect. The growth in sales from acquisitions in the year ended December 31, 2008 is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of ChemTreat in July 2007 and Tektronix in November 2007, both of which are included in the Professional Instrumentation segment. The acquisitions of other, smaller businesses in the Medical Technologies, Professional Instrumentation and Industrial Technologies segments also contributed to the year-over-year growth. The Company acquired seventeen businesses and twelve businesses during the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Operating profit margins from continuing operations for the Company were 14.7% in the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 15.8% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Charges recorded related to the fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities reduced the Company’s 2008 operating profit margins by 65 basis points. In addition, the dilutive impact of acquisitions reduced 2008 operating profit margins by 80 basis points, including the adverse impact of $60 million ($45 million or $0.13 per diluted share, net of tax) of acquired inventory and acquired deferred revenue fair value charges recorded related to the acquisition of Tektronix. The Company also incurred Tektronix related charges in 2007 associated with acquired in-process research and development that affected year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 55 basis points. A gain recorded in the second quarter of 2007 from the collection of indemnification proceeds related to a lawsuit also affected year-over-year comparisons of operating profit margins by 10 basis points. 30 Table of Contents Restructuring and Other Related Charges In light of the worsening global economic environment, the Company initiated a series of restructuring actions during the fourth quarter of 2008 to better position the Company’s cost base for future periods. As a result, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring and other related charges totaling $82.0 million ($61.5 million, net of tax or $0.18 per diluted share) as indicated in the following table ($ in thousands): Total Restructuring Charges Employee severance and related charges $ 72,257 Facility exit and related charges 3,753 Total Restructuring Charges $ 76,010 Other Related Charges Property, plant & equipment impairment $ 1,557 Inventory impairment 4,398 Total Restructuring and Other Related Charges $ 81,965 The restructuring and other related charges are intended to improve future operational efficiency through targeted workforce reductions and manufacturing facility consolidations and closures. Approximately 93% of the total pre-tax charges require cash payments, which are being funded with cash generated from operations. Through December 31, 2008, approximately $20 million of required cash payments had been made. The majority of the remaining cash expenditures are expected to occur in the first quarter of 2009. As a result of these restructuring activities, the Company expects recurring pre-tax savings to exceed $100 million during 2009. The fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities resulted in net workforce reductions of approximately 1,800 associates and thirteen facility closures, the majority of which have been completed as of December 31, 2008. Remaining workforce reductions and facility closure activities associated with the fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities to be completed during 2009 are not significant. In conjunction with the closing of facilities, certain inventory was written off as unusable in future operating locations. This inventory consisted principally of component parts and raw materials, which were either redundant to inventory at the facilities being merged or were not economically feasible to relocate since the inventory was purchased to operate on equipment and tooling which was not being relocated. In addition, property, plant and equipment at closed facilities were evaluated based on expected future use and written down to fair value where impairments were identified. In the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings, the pre-tax restructuring and related charges, consisting of $76 million cash charges and $6 million non-cash charges, are reflected in the following captions ($ in thousands): Statement of Earnings Caption Year EndedDecember 31,2008 Cost of sales $ 33,130 Selling, general and administrative expenses 48,835 $ 81,965 The impact of these restructuring and related charges in each of the Company’s segments is discussed in the following analysis of the segment results of operations. 31 Table of Contents Business Segments The table below summarizes sales by business segment for each of the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Professional Instrumentation $ 4,860.8 $ 3,537.9 $ 2,906.5 Medical Technologies 3,277.0 2,998.0 2,220.0 Industrial Technologies 3,265.5 3,153.4 2,988.8 Tools & Components 1,294.2 1,336.6 1,350.8 Total $ 12,697.5 $ 11,025.9 $ 9,466.1 PROFESSIONAL INSTRUMENTATION Businesses in the Company’s Professional Instrumentation segment offer professional and technical customers various products and services that are used to enable or enhance the performance of their work. The Professional Instrumentation segment encompasses two strategic lines of business: environmental, and test and measurement. These businesses produce and sell bench top and compact, professional electronic test tools and calibration equipment; a variety of video test and monitoring products, network management solutions, network diagnostic equipment and related services; water quality instrumentation and consumables and ultraviolet disinfection systems; industrial water treatment solutions; and retail/commercial petroleum products and services, including dispensers, payment systems, underground storage tank leak detection and vapor recovery systems.

Sales growth was experienced in both of the segment’s strategic lines of business during the year, with the majority of the growth coming from acquisitions. Price increases accounted for approximately 2.0% sales growth which is reflected as a component of the sales from existing businesses. 32 Table of Contents Fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the Professional Instrumentation segment by 60 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. In addition, the dilutive impact of recently acquired businesses reduced 2008 operating profit margins by 295 basis points, including the adverse impact of acquired inventory and acquired deferred revenue fair value charges recorded related to the acquisition of Tektronix (which charges will not recur in 2009). The Company also incurred Tektronix-related charges in 2007 associated with acquired in-process research and development that affected year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 170 basis points. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales increased during 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily as a result of the increase in amortization expense associated with the intangible assets acquired in connection with the Tektronix acquisition. Overview of Businesses within Professional Instrumentation Segment Environmental. Sales from the Company’s environmental businesses, representing approximately 51% of segment sales for 2008, increased 15.5% in 2008 compared to 2007. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 6.5% growth while acquisitions accounted for 7.5% growth and currency translation accounted for 1.5% growth. The segment’s water quality businesses experienced high-single digit revenue growth from existing businesses in 2008 as compared to 2007. This growth was primarily a result of strong laboratory and process sales, reflecting in part the results of increased sales force investments and penetration into emerging markets. Growth in sales was experienced in all major geographic regions with particular strength in Asia where sales increased at a double digit rate. Also contributing to the year-over-year growth was increased demand by municipalities for the businesses’ ultraviolet disinfection water treatment product offerings which experienced a mid-teens sales growth rate. The retail petroleum equipment business experienced mid-single digit revenue growth from existing businesses in 2008 as compared to 2007. This growth was primarily driven by strong sales of payment and point of sale retail and payment solution product offerings offset by a decline in dispensing equipment sales primarily in North America and Europe. An increase in demand for the business’ vapor recovery products in North America also contributed to the year-over-year sales growth, primarily related to an enhanced vapor recovery product that received regulatory approval and launched during the fourth quarter of 2008. Test and Measurement. Sales from the Company’s test and measurement businesses, representing approximately 49% of segment sales for 2008, grew 70% compared to 2007. Sales from existing businesses were essentially flat while acquisitions accounted for 68.0% growth and currency translation accounted for approximately 2.0% growth. Sales growth from existing businesses was driven primarily by performance during the first nine months of 2008 as a result of strong sales of the business’ thermography and precision measurement product offerings as well as strong growth from investments in emerging markets. While demand for the business’ thermography products continued to increase as compared to 2007 during the fourth quarter, demand slowed for the business’ traditional industrial digital hand-held instruments and precision measurement products resulting in a mid-single digit rate sales decline in the quarter and offsetting the growth experienced in the first nine months. In addition, the sales decline in the fourth quarter is a result of reductions of inventory in the distribution channel as well as the impact of currency exchange rate volatility on customer demand in certain emerging markets. Sales also declined throughout 2008 in the business’ enterprise network performance management line of business as a result of generally lower telecommunications demand and slower information technology spending by customers. 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 Segment sales for Professional Instrumentation increased 22.0% for 2007 compared to 2006. Sales from existing businesses increased in both of the segment’s strategic lines of business. Price increases accounted for approximately 1.5% sales growth and the impact of that increase is reflected in sales from existing businesses. 33 Table of Contents Operating profit margins were 20.1% in 2007 compared to 21.5% in 2006. Operating profit margin improvements of 135 basis points related to existing businesses were more than offset by the dilutive impact of lower operating profit margins of acquired businesses, which reduced segment operating profit margins by 260 basis points compared to 2006. Included in the dilutive impact on operating margins from acquired businesses is approximately $68 million (185 basis points) in charges associated with the acquisition of Tektronix, primarily related to acquired in-process research and development activities, acquired inventory and acquired deferred revenue. In addition, year over year comparisons are impacted by a gain on the sale of real estate during 2006 and recovery of certain previously written-off receivables during 2006 which increased that period’s operating profit margins by 15 basis points. Leverage on increased sales volume in 2008 contributed positively to overall Professional Instrumentation operating profit margins. Overview of Businesses within Professional Instrumentation Segment Environmental. Sales from the Company’s environmental businesses, representing approximately 60% of segment sales for 2007, increased 16.5% in 2007 compared to 2006. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 6.0% growth. Acquisitions accounted for 7.0% growth and currency translation accounted for 3.5% growth. The Company’s water quality businesses experienced low-double digit revenue growth for 2007 compared to 2006, primarily as a result of strength in sales of laboratory and process instrumentation products in all major geographic regions. In addition, sales of the Company’s ultraviolet water treatment systems grew double-digit compared to 2006. Investment in sales forces and other growth initiatives, in addition to continued penetration of the Asian wastewater market, including a significant reclamation project in Australia, contributed to the growth. Sales growth from acquisitions primarily related to the acquisition of ChemTreat in July 2007. The retail petroleum equipment business experienced low-single digit revenue growth in 2007 compared to 2006. The business’ point of sale payment systems and service business enjoyed robust growth in 2007, primarily in Europe. In addition, the business experienced strong demand during 2007 in North America and China for its leak detection systems that were introduced during the period. These sales gains were offset by difficult prior year comparisons, a result of strong dispenser sales in 2006 due to extensive refurbishment activity in Europe and regulatory mandates in Mexico that did not repeat in 2007. Test and Measurement. Sales from the Company’s test and measurement businesses, representing approximately 40% of segment sales for 2007, grew 31.5% compared to 2006. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 8.0% growth. Acquisitions accounted for 20.0% growth and currency translation accounted for approximately 3.5% growth. New product offerings in the thermography, power quality test and process calibration markets generated strong sales in the electrical and industrial channels in all major geographical areas during 2007. The network test business experienced mid-single digit revenue growth in 2007 compared to 2006. Large orders from telecommunications carriers in the United States during the first three quarters of 2007 and cable test equipment sales in Europe were the primary drivers of the network test growth. Acquisition growth was primarily related to the acquisition of Tektronix in addition to several smaller acquisitions throughout the year. MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES The Medical Technologies segment consists of businesses that offer research and clinical medical professionals various products and services that are used in connection with the performance of their work. 34 Table of Contents Medical Technologies Selected Financial Data For the Years Ended December 31($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Sales $ 3,277.0 $ 2,998.0 $ 2,220.0 Operating Profit 370.5 393.2 261.6 Depreciation and amortization 123.5 119.7 84.3 Restructuring and other related charges 26.1 — — Operating profit as a % of sales 11.3 % 13.1 % 11.8 % Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales 3.8 % 4.0 % 3.8 % Restructuring and other related charges as a % of sales 0.8 % — — Components of Sales Growth 2008vs.2007 2007vs.2006 Existing businesses 4.5 % 8.0 % Acquisitions 2.0 % 22.0 % Currency exchange rates 3.0 % 5.0 % Total 9.5 % 35.0 % 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 Segment sales for Medical Technologies increased 9.5% for 2008 as compared to 2007. Sales growth was primarily driven by the segment’s acute care diagnostics, life sciences instrumentation and pathology diagnostics businesses. Price increases accounted for approximately 1.0% sales growth which is reflected as a component of the sales from existing businesses. The fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the Medical Technologies segment by 80 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. In addition, the dilutive impact of recently acquired businesses reduced 2008 operating profit margins by 40 basis points. A decline in demand for certain products in the dental technologies business, in addition to increased sales force investment and research and development costs within the life sciences business, also adversely impacted year-over-year operating margin profit comparisons. Overview of Businesses within Medical Technologies Segment Revenues in the segment’s acute care diagnostics business grew at mid-single digit rate in 2008 as compared to 2007. The year-over-year growth was primarily attributable to strong aftermarket consumables sales for the business installed base of acute care diagnostic instrumentation, sales of the business’ compact version of its blood gas analysis instrument as well as sales resulting from the launch of the business’ AQT cardiac marker during 2008. Sales growth was experienced in all major geographic regions during the year. Particularly strong growth in emerging markets during the first nine months of the year moderated during the fourth quarter as a result of currency exchange rate volatility and economic uncertainty. The segment’s life science instrumentation business experienced high-single digit revenue growth in 2008 as compared to 2007. Continued strong sales of the business’ pathology diagnostics instrumentation and consumables offerings as well as compound microscopy product offerings drove the majority of this growth. All major geographic regions experienced growth. The acquisition of Surgipath Medical Industries in the fourth quarter of 2008 is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the pathology diagnostics business. 35 Table of Contents The segment’s dental business’ revenue in 2008 was essentially flat as compared to 2007. Revenues in the dental technologies business grew at a mid-single digit rate through the first nine months of 2008 primarily driven by strong demand for imaging equipment. However, a significant decline in demand in the fourth quarter for the majority of the products in the dental technologies’ business, including imaging equipment, more than offset this earlier growth resulting in low-single digit sales declines for the year. The decline in demand is primarily attributable to customer decisions to cancel or delay capital spending as well as inventory reductions in certain distribution channels. Offsetting the 2008 sales declines in the dental technologies business was low-single digit growth in the dental consumables business. Sales growth in the dental consumables’ businesses was primarily due to strong sales of general dentistry consumables and increased demand for endodontic and infection control products, offset by lower demand in the orthodontia product line. 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 Segment sales increased 35% for 2007 compared to 2006. Price increases, which are included in sales from existing businesses, contributed 1.0% to overall sales growth in 2007 compared to 2006. Operating profit margin improvements in the segment’s existing businesses contributed 100 basis points to the overall operating margin improvement in 2007. Improvements in the operating profit margins of the dental consumable, acute care diagnostic and life sciences instrumentation businesses were partially offset by lower operating profit margins in the dental equipment businesses. Recently acquired businesses adversely impacted 2007 operating profit margins by 40 basis points as compared to 2006. In addition, on a comparative basis, 2007 operating margins benefited approximately 50 basis points from the adverse impact on 2006 operating margins that resulted from charges recorded associated with the fair value of acquired inventory related to the acquisition of Sybron. Overview of Businesses within Medical Technologies Segment The segment’s acute care diagnostics business experienced high-single digit revenue growth in 2007 compared to 2006. Increasing sales of diagnostic instruments in Europe (particularly Russia) in 2007 contributed to this sales growth. The North American and Asia/Pacific markets also contributed to the growth, although at somewhat lower rates than those experienced in the European markets. New product introductions resulting from the business’ continued research and development efforts also contributed to this growth. The segment’s life science instrumentation business experienced mid-teens revenue growth in 2007 compared to 2006. Robust microscopy demand, particularly confocal microscopes, in North America and Asia were the primary growth drivers. The integration of Vision with Leica Microsystems was completed in 2007 and generated incremental revenue growth, the majority of which has been included as a component of acquisition growth during 2007. Vision’s revenue grew approximately 30% in 2007 compared to 2006 when it was a stand-alone company. The segment’s dental business experienced mid-single digit revenue growth in 2007 compared to 2006. The business experienced increased sales volumes in its restorative and orthodontia products as well as in the instrument and treatment unit product offerings across all major geographies. In addition, increased sales of both two-dimensional and three-dimensional imaging products contributed to the revenue growth in the European market. This growth was partially offset by a decline in instrument and treatment unit sales to Asia reflecting a weak overall Japanese market and the need to re-register certain products with regulatory authorities in South Korea. INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES Businesses in the Industrial Technologies segment manufacture products and sub-systems that are typically incorporated by customers and systems integrators into production and packaging lines as well as incorporated by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) into various end-products. Many of the businesses also provide services to support their products, including helping customers integrate and install the products and helping ensure product uptime. The Industrial Technologies segment encompasses two strategic lines of business, motion and product 36 Table of Contents identification, and two focused niche businesses, aerospace and defense, and sensors and controls. These businesses produce and sell product identification equipment and consumables; motion, position, speed, temperature, and level instruments and sensing devices; liquid flow and quality measuring devices; aerospace safety devices and defense articles; and electronic and mechanical counting and controlling devices. In the third quarter of 2007, the Company disposed of the power quality businesses that were part of this segment and all 2007 and 2006 results of the segment have been adjusted to exclude the results of these discontinued operations. Industrial Technologies Segment Selected Financial Data For the Years Ended December 31($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Sales $ 3,265.5 $ 3,153.4 $ 2,988.8 Operating profit 522.1 532.5 467.7 Depreciation and amortization 64.4 63.2 61.1 Restructuring and other related charges 23.1 — — Operating profit as a % of sales 16.0 % 16.9 % 15.7 % Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales 2.0 % 2.0 % 2.0 % Restructuring and other related charges as a % of sales 0.7 % — — Components of Sales Growth 2008vs.2007 2007vs.2006 Existing businesses 1.5 % 1.5 % Acquisitions — 0.5 % Currency exchange rates 2.0 % 3.5 % Total 3.5 % 5.5 % 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 Segment sales for Industrial Technologies increased 3.5% for 2008 as compared to 2007. Sales growth experienced for the majority of the year in the segment’s motion and niche aerospace and defense and sensors lines of business was partially offset by sales declines experienced in the segment’s product identification line of business, primarily in the second half of 2008. Price increases accounted for approximately 2.0% sales growth which is reflected as a component of the sales from existing businesses. The fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the Industrial Technologies segment by 70 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. In addition, gains recorded in 2007 due to the collection of indemnification proceeds related to a lawsuit and from the sale of real estate adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 45 basis points. Operating profit margin improvements during 2008, primarily relating to cost savings initiatives implemented beginning in late 2007, partially offset these adverse impacts. Overview of Businesses within Industrial Technologies Segment Motion Sales in the segment’s motion businesses, representing approximately 34% of segment sales in 2008, increased 4.0% over 2007. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 1.0% growth while currency translation accounted for 3.0% growth during 2008. There were no acquisitions in the motion businesses in 2008 or 2007. 37 Table of Contents Sales growth from existing businesses during 2008 was primarily driven by demand for custom motors and drives, particularly in the elevator application, flat panel display and aerospace and defense end markets. Largely offsetting this growth was weakness in demand for the business’ standard motors and drives product offerings throughout the year, and in particular during the fourth quarter, primarily in North America and Europe. In addition, during the fourth quarter, demand for products supporting the semiconductor and electronic assembly end markets, as well as other industrial applications, declined at levels in excess of the declines experienced during the first nine months of the year. Product Identification. The product identification businesses accounted for approximately 27% of segment sales in 2008. Sales from the segment’s product identification businesses decreased 1.5% in 2008 compared to 2007. Sales from existing businesses accounted for a 3.5% decline in sales while currency translation contributed 1.5% to revenue growth and acquisitions contributed 0.5% to revenue growth in 2008. Through the first nine months of 2008, sales growth driven by increased demand for both consumable products and services associated with the installed base of marking and coding equipment had partially offset a decline in equipment sales. Further weakening of equipment demand during the fourth quarter, primarily in North America and Europe, resulted in double-digit year-over-year declines in equipment sales during the quarter as customers cancelled or delayed purchases. The declines in equipment sales more than offset the sales growth from consumables and services experienced throughout the majority of 2008. In addition, sales in the integrated scanning system product line declined throughout 2008 due to lower capital expenditures by the United States Postal Service (USPS) and the timing of completion of various large projects for other large parcel post and retail customers. Focused Niche Businesses. Revenues in the segment’s existing niche businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2008 as compared to 2007, driven primarily by high-single digit sales growth in the segment’s aerospace and defense businesses and low-single digit sales growth in the segment’s sensors and controls businesses. Sales growth from the sensors and controls business primarily occurred during the first nine months of 2008 as demand weakened during the fourth quarter resulting in essentially flat segment sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the comparable period of 2007. 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 Price increases contributed 1.5% of sales growth compared to 2006 which impact is reflected in sales from existing businesses. Operating profit margin improvements in the segment’s existing businesses contributed 85 basis points to the overall operating margin improvement for 2007 as compared to 2006. This margin improvement was driven in part by continued margin expansion in the motion businesses reflecting pricing and productivity initiatives as well as the impact of lower levels of lower-margin USPS sales in 2007 compared to 2006 within the product identification business. In addition, during 2007, the segment recorded a pre-tax gain of $12 million upon collection of indemnification proceeds related to a lawsuit, which improved operating profit margins by 40 basis points for 2007. These positive factors were partially offset by new acquisitions, restructuring activities, spending for product development and emerging market sales force initiatives. Overview of Businesses within Industrial Technologies Segment Motion Sales in the Company’s motion businesses, representing approximately 34% of segment sales in 2007, increased 2.5% over 2006. Sales from existing businesses accounted for a 1.0% decrease in sales and currency translation accounted for 3.5% growth in sales during 2007. There were no acquisitions in the business in 2007 or 2006. During 2007, the motion business experienced sales growth primarily in the elevator markets as a result of global conversions to more energy efficient systems and new construction demand in Asia. Demand in OEM applications in Europe also contributed year-over-year sales growth. These growth drivers, however, were more than offset by year-over-year sales declines resulting from weakness in certain technology end markets as well as declines in the miniature motors business reflecting reduced customer demand. 38 Table of Contents Product Identification. The product identification businesses accounted for approximately 28% of segment sales in 2007. Sales from the Company’s product identification businesses increased 3.5% in 2007 compared to 2006. Sales from existing businesses accounted for a 1.0% decline while currency translation contributed 3.5% to revenue growth and acquisitions contributed 1.0% to revenue growth in 2007. The 2007 decline in sales from existing operations resulted from the business completing several large systems installation projects with the USPS during 2006 which did not repeat in 2007. Sales for the business’ non-USPS marking products grew at a mid-single digit rates during 2007 compared to 2006. Strong equipment and after-market sales, particularly in China, Latin America and Europe, were the primary drivers of this growth facilitated by increased investments in the business’ sales force and new product launches in these regions. Focused Niche Businesses The segment’s niche businesses experienced a mid-single digit growth rate in 2007 compared to 2006. This growth was primarily driven by strong sales growth from existing businesses in the Company’s aerospace and defense businesses, partially offset by sales declines in the Company’s sensors and controls business, reflecting continued softness in the semi-conductor and electronic assembly markets. TOOLS & COMPONENTS The Tools & Components segment is one of the largest producers and distributors of general purpose and specialty mechanics’ hand tools. Other products manufactured by the businesses in this segment include toolboxes and storage devices; diesel engine retarders; wheel service equipment; drill chucks; and custom-designed fasteners and components. Tools & Components Selected Financial Data For the Years Ended December 31($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Sales $ 1,294.2 $ 1,336.6 $ 1,350.8 Operating profit 157.7 175.6 194.1 Depreciation and amortization 21.0 20.8 21.4 Restructuring and other related charges 4.0 — — Operating profit as a % of sales 12.2 % 13.1 % 14.4 % Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales 1.6 % 1.6 % 1.6 % Restructuring and other related charges as a % of sales 0.3 % — — Components of Sales Growth 2008vs.2007 2007vs.2006 Existing businesses (3.5 )% (0.5 )% Acquisition / Product line divestiture — (1.0 )% Currency exchange rates 0.5 % 0.5 % Total (3.0 )% (1.0 )% 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 Price increases accounted for approximately 2.0% sales growth on a year-over-year basis which is reflected as a component of the sales from existing businesses. 39 Table of Contents The fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the Tools and Components segment by 30 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. Elevated commodity costs and lower overall sales volumes in the mechanics’ hand tools business also adversely impacted operating profit margins. A 2008 gain from the settlement of an insurance claim related to a 2007 plant fire, coupled with the impact of charges recorded in 2007 associated with the fire, favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 50 basis points. Commodity costs declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 and, assuming they remain at the current levels, will provide a benefit to the segment in 2009. Overview of Businesses within the Tools & Components Segment Mechanics’ hand tools sales, representing approximately 69% of segment sales in 2008, declined 5.5% in 2008 compared to 2007. Sales from existing businesses declined 6.0% during 2008, offset by a 0.5% positive impact as a result of foreign currency translation. The sales decline is primarily attributable to weak North American demand in both the retail, mobile and industrial hand tools end markets. Partially offsetting the weak North American demand was sales growth in the Asian market, primarily in the first half of 2008, as the rate of growth in the region slowed during the second half of the year. The segment’s niche businesses experienced a modest sales increase during 2008 as compared to 2007. Higher customer demand in the segment’s engine retarder business, which rebounded from the impact of regulatory changes that resulted in reduced 2007 sales levels, were largely offset by lower demand in the segment’s other niche businesses during year, with particularly lower demand in the fourth quarter. 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 Sales from existing businesses for 2007 reflect the impact of certain regulatory requirements that became effective at the beginning of 2007 which accelerated demand for the Company’s engine retarder products in 2006 and adversely impacted demand in 2007. Price increases partially offset the decline in sales and contributed approximately 2.5% of sales growth compared to 2006. The impact of that price increase is reflected in sales from existing businesses. Operating profit margins for the segment were 13.1% in 2007 compared to 14.4% in 2006. Costs associated with workforce reductions and adjustments to production levels to match demand in the engine retarder business decreased operating profit margins by 85 basis in 2007 compared with 2006. Lower sales volumes in the mechanics’ hand tool business with Sears/K-Mart and increased lead costs in the wheel weight business also had a negative impact on the 2007 operating margins. In addition, operating profit margins were adversely impacted by 40 basis points as a result of expenses incurred in connection with a fire in one of the business’ manufacturing facilities in China and costs incurred primarily in the fourth quarter of 2007 to close one facility and reduce headcount. Overview of Businesses within the Tools & Components Segment Mechanics’ hand tools sales, representing approximately 70% of segment sales in 2007, grew 1.0% in 2007 compared to 2006. The segment’s Matco business grew slightly during 2007 as the business benefited from recent product introductions and price increases which offset declines in distributor average purchase levels during 2007. The retail hand tool business experienced strength in China and in its export business to Europe, as well as certain of its retail channels. This performance, in large part, was offset by a decline in sales to Sears/K-Mart, the retail hand tools business’ largest customer. Year-over-year softness in same-store sales of hand tools at Sears/K-Mart also adversely impacted the business. The segment’s niche businesses experienced mid-single digit sales declines during 2007 as compared to 2006. The impact of the regulatory issue noted above was partially offset by improved sales performance in the segment’s wheel service business during 2007 driven by price increases necessary to recover increased lead costs. 40 Table of Contents GROSS PROFIT For the Years Ended December 31($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Sales $ 12,697.5 $ 11,025.9 $ 9,466.1 Cost of sales 6,757.3 5,985.0 5,269.0 Gross profit 5,940.2 5,040.9 4,197.1 Gross profit margin 46.8 % 45.7 % 44.3 % Gross profit margins from continuing operations for 2008 increased 110 basis points from 2007. Included in the 2008 gross profit margins is $33 million (25 basis points) of restructuring and other related costs. The increase in gross profit margins over 2007 is primarily a result of leverage on increased sales volume, particularly in higher-margin consumable oriented businesses, the impact of cost-saving initiatives that began in late 2007 and generally higher gross profit margins in businesses recently acquired, primarily Tektronix. The impact on gross margins of higher commodity costs prevalent through the majority of 2008 was partially mitigated by price increases implemented throughout the Company. These higher commodity costs have declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 and, assuming the costs remain at the current levels, will provide a benefit to the Company in 2009 assuming sales volumes similar to those experienced by the Company during 2008. The increase in gross profit margins from continuing operations for 2007 as compared to 2006 resulted from leverage on increased sales volume, the on-going cost improvements in existing business units driven by our Danaher Business System processes and low-cost region initiatives and generally higher gross profit margins in businesses recently acquired and increases in selling prices. Gross profit margins also improved due to lower-margin sales to USPS in the product identification business comprising a smaller proportion of sales during 2007 compared to 2006. The gross margins for 2007 also benefited from the inclusion of a full year of results from higher-margin Sybron business as compared to 2006 which only included seven months of Sybron results as a result of Sybron acquisition in May 2006. The improvements were partially offset by higher commodity costs incurred in 2007 for which full recovery in the form of price increases dilutes reported margins. OPERATING EXPENSES For the Years Ended December 31($ in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Sales $ 12,697.5 $ 11,025.9 $ 9,466.1 Selling, general and administrative expenses 3,345.3 2,713.1 2,273.2 Research and development expenses 725.4 601.4 440.0 SG&A as a % of sales 26.3 % 24.6 % 24.0 % R&D as a % of sales 5.7 % 5.5 % 4.6 % Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for 2008 increased 170 basis points from 2007. Included in the 2008 selling, general and administrative expenses is $49 million (40 basis points) of restructuring and other related costs. Other increases in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales are primarily associated with recently acquired businesses and their higher relative operating expense structures. Increased spending to fund growth opportunities throughout the Company, particularly in emerging markets, also contributed to the growth as a percentage of sales. 41 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased 60 basis points during 2007 as compared to 2006 levels. The year-over-year increases resulted from recently acquired businesses (principally Sybron Dental and Vision) which generally have higher operating expense structures, compared to the Company’s other businesses, as well as increased investment in sales forces in emerging markets. These increases were partially offset by operating leverage from higher sales during 2007 as compared to 2006. In addition, the recovery of certain previously written-off indemnity receivable balances during 2007 favorably impacted selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales. Research and development expenses, consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs, as a percentage of sales were approximately 20 basis points higher in 2008 as compared to 2007. The 2007 charge for acquired in-process research and development related to the Tektronix acquisition, as described below, impacted year-over-year comparisons by 75 basis points. The relatively higher research and development cost structures of recently acquired businesses, primarily Tektronix, and higher investment in research and development in the Medical Technologies segment were the primary drivers of these year-over-year increases. The Company continues to invest in new product development within all of its businesses, with particular emphasis on the medical technologies, test and measurement, environmental and product identification businesses. Research and development expenses were approximately 90 basis points higher in 2007 as compared to 2006. In 2007, the Company expensed approximately $60.4 million of in-process research and development related to the Tektronix acquisition as compared to approximately $6.5 million of in-process research and development expensed in 2006 related to the Vision acquisition. Newly acquired companies and their higher, relative research and development cost structures also contributed to the year-over-year increase. INTEREST COSTS AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS For a description of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness, please refer to “–Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities and Indebtedness” below. Interest expense of $130 million in 2008 was approximately $20 million higher than 2007 as a result of higher average debt levels during 2008, primarily as a result of borrowings incurred in the fourth quarter 2007 to fund the acquisition of Tektronix. Interest expense of $110 million in 2007 was approximately $30 million higher than 2006. The increase is primarily due to higher average debt levels during 2007, due to borrowings incurred to fund the 2007 acquisitions of Tektronix and ChemTreat and the 2006 acquisitions of Sybron and Vision. Interest income of $10 million, $6 million and $8 million was recognized in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Interest income during 2008 was higher than during 2007 as a result of higher average invested cash balances as less cash was employed in acquisitions during 2008. Interest income in 2007 was lower than 2006 as average invested cash balances were lower in 2007 compared to 2006 due to employing cash balances to complete several acquisitions in late 2006 and throughout 2007 as well as to repurchase shares of Company common stock in 2007. In addition, lower interest rates prevailing during 2007 contributed to the decrease in interest income. INCOME TAXES General The Company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as discussed below), the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in tax laws. The tax effect of significant unusual items or changes in tax regulations is reflected in the period in which they occur. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2008 differs from the United States federal statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of lower effective tax rates on certain earnings from operations outside of the United States. No provisions for United States income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States. The amount of United States income taxes that may be applicable to such 42 Table of Contents earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the Company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings. As of December 31, 2008, the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately $6.3 billion. The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for contingent tax liabilities. Based on these reviews, the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the closure of tax years subject to tax audit, reserves are adjusted as necessary. However, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the Company’s estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are determined or resolved. Additionally, the amount of earnings and/or deductions realized in various jurisdictions in which the Company operates may differ from current estimates. Year-Over-Year Changes in Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate The Company’s effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 24.7%, 25.8% and 22.4%, respectively. The Company’s 2008 effective tax rate of 24.7% includes the impact of approximately $9.5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, related to gains from the net reduction of reserves associated with uncertain tax positions and discrete items recorded primarily during the second quarter. In addition, the effective tax rate reflects a full year benefit of approximately $10 million from research and experimentation credits which were reinstated with the enactment of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 in the fourth quarter of 2008. The effective tax rate also reflects the impact of the continued growth in earnings outside of the United States. Refer to Note 13 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company’s 2007 effective tax rate from continuing operations of 25.8% reflects net discrete tax benefits of approximately $21 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. New tax legislation that was signed into law in several taxing jurisdictions during 2007, most notably in Germany and Denmark, reduced income tax rates for 2008 and future periods which resulted in a reduction in the Company’s deferred tax liabilities and a like reduction in 2007 income tax expense as required under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The lower statutory rates are expected to be offset by other statutory changes in these jurisdictions, such that the Company’s effective tax rate in future years will not be materially reduced as a result of the legislation. Partially offsetting the benefit from the above tax rate reduction was the effect of establishing income tax reserves during the year related to uncertain tax positions in various taxing jurisdiction, net of the reduction of tax reserves associated with Sweden. The effective tax rate for 2009 is expected to be approximately 26%. INFLATION Market forces during the first nine months of 2008 resulted in generally higher average costs for raw materials, with prices of many raw materials reaching historic price levels early in the third quarter. These costs generally declined after reaching these historic levels. The Company passed along certain of these cost increases to its customers. The raw materials purchased at record high price levels have largely been consumed in the production process. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk, which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. In addition, the Company’s broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole. 43 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk The Company’s short-term debt obligations relate primarily to commercial paper borrowings. Refer to Note 8 for information regarding the Company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2008. As these obligations mature, the Company anticipates issuing additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. Changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect the Company’s results of operations. In 2008, a 100 percent increase in average market interest rates on the Company’s commercial paper borrowings would have increased the Company’s interest expense by approximately $29 million. A 100 percent hypothetical fluctuation is used as the Company’s actual commercial paper interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2008. Based on a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis-point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2008, the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt, excluding the LYONs, would decrease by approximately $65 million (the LYONs have not been included in this calculation as the value of the convertible debt is primarily derived from the LYONs conversion feature). The Company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturity and therefore, with respect to the fixed-rate long-term debt, fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on the Company’s results of operations or stockholders’ equity. In connection with the maturity and repayment of the Company’s $250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.1% notes in October 2008, the Company’s two associated interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of $100 million matured. The swap agreements were accounted for as fair value hedges in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, and qualified as “effective” or “perfect” hedges. Currency Exchange Rate Risk Exchange rate risk arises from the Company’s investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries, as well as from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the Company’s net investment in international subsidiaries, net of the translation effect of the Eurobonds, is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive income” component of stockholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in major currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2008 (net of the translation effect of the Company’s Eurobond Notes, discussed below) would result in a reduction of stockholders’ equity of approximately $396 million. In addition, although the Company has a U.S. dollar functional currency for reporting purposes, it has manufacturing sites throughout the world and a substantial portion of its sales are generated in foreign currencies. Sales by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the United States dollar. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Therefore, both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales, profit, and assets and liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Eurobond Notes described below (which as of December 31, 2008 had outstanding borrowings in principal amount equivalent to $699 million) and the Euro-denominated portion of the Company’s commercial paper program (which as of December 31, 2008 had no outstanding borrowings), provide a natural hedge to a portion of the Company’s European net asset position. In the fourth quarter of 2008, two wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts related to anticipated sales denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiaries entering the contracts. The forward contracts, having an aggregate notional amount of 3.4 billion Japanese Yen ($37.5 million) related to one subsidiary and an aggregate notional amount of 14.5 million Euro ($20.3 million) related to the second subsidiary, will be settled at various dates during the year ending December 31, 2009 in 44 Table of Contents accordance with their terms. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, the Company accounts for these forward contracts as cash flow hedges. These instruments qualify as “effective” or “perfect” hedges. As of December 31, 2008, the aggregate fair value of the forward contracts was approximately $2 million. Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, foreign currency forward contracts and trade accounts receivable. The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to its financial instruments. The Company places cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world, and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents. Our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds. In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to the diversity of the Company’s customers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial conditions and obtains collateral or other security when appropriate. Notwithstanding these efforts, the current distress in the global economy may increase the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable. 45 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Management assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Although recent distress in the financial markets and the global economy in general has not had a significant impact on the Company’s liquidity as of the filing date of this Report, management continues to monitor the financial markets and general global economic conditions. The capital markets worldwide, including the United States, have been severely impacted by credit losses, asset write-downs and failures of some financial institutions. This disruption has impacted credit spreads and pricing on new securities issuances. The Company’s credit facility is predominately with institutions that, to date, appear to be relatively unaffected by the disruption. The Company’s ability to access the commercial paper market has also not, to date, been affected adversely by the capital markets’ disruption. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its cash flow and other sources of liquidity, primarily its commercial paper program and committed credit facility, will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions and maintain its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. For a discussion of risks related to the distress in the financial markets and the global economy in general, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity ($ in millions) For the Years Ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 Operating cash flows from continuing operations $ 1,859.0 $ 1,699.3 $ 1,530.8 Operating cash flows from discontinued operations — (53.5 ) 16.5 Net cash flows from operating activities 1,859.0 1,645.8 1,547.3 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (193.8 ) (162.1 ) (136.4 ) Cash paid for acquisitions (423.2 ) (3,576.6 ) (2,656.1 ) Cash paid for investment in acquisition target and other marketable securities — (23.2 ) (84.1 ) Proceeds from sale of investment and divestitures — 301.3 98.5 Other sources 49.6 15.5 10.0 Investing cash flows from continued operations (567.4 ) (3,445.1 ) (2,768.1 ) Investing cash flows from discontinued operations — (0.7 ) (1.3 ) Net cash used in investing activities (567.4 ) (3,445.8 ) (2,769.4 ) Proceeds from the issuance of common stock 82.4 733.0 98.4 Net debt (repayments) / borrowings (1,092.3 ) 1,131.0 1,145.0 Purchase of treasury stock (74.2 ) (117.5 ) — Payment of dividends (38.2 ) (34.3 ) (24.6 ) Net cash (used in) / provided by financing activities (1,122.3 ) 1,712.2 1,218.8 • Operating cash flow from continuing operations, a key source of the Company’s liquidity, increased $160 million during 2008, or approximately 9.5%, as compared to 2007. • Debt repayments constituted the most significant use of cash during 2008. The Company repaid approximately $1.1 billion of debt, net of new borrowings during this period. 46 Table of Contents • The Company acquired seventeen businesses during 2008. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was approximately $423 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired and $8.5 million of debt assumed. • As of December 31, 2008, the Company held $393 million of cash and cash equivalents. Operating Activities The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position, with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for items such as income taxes, pension funding decisions and other items impact reported cash flows. Operating cash flow from continuing operations, a key source of the Company’s liquidity, was approximately $1.9 billion for 2008, an increase of $160 million, or approximately 9.5% as compared to 2007. Earnings growth of $104 million in addition to an increase of approximately $39 million in contributions from operating working capital (which the Company defines as trade accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable) as compared to 2007 contributed to the overall year-over-year increase in operating cash flows. The 2008 operating working capital contribution increased primarily due to strong collections of accounts receivable. Operating cash flows during 2008 also benefited approximately $83 million from year-over-year increases in stock compensation, depreciation and amortization charges which do not require the use of cash. In addition, non-cash acquisition related charges incurred related to acquired inventory and acquired deferred revenue in connection with the 2007 acquisition of Tektronix had a positive impact on operating cash flow comparisons. Approximately $100 million of additional income tax payments made in 2008 related to continuing operations as compared to 2007 partially offset these positive factors. Investing Activities Cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures and cash flows from divestitures of businesses or assets. Net cash used in investing activities related to continuing operations was $567 million during 2008 compared to $3.4 billion of net cash used in the comparable period of 2007. Gross capital spending increased $32 million from $162 million during 2007 to $194 million during 2008, due primarily to capital spending relating to newly acquired businesses and increased spending related to investments in the Company’s low-cost region sourcing initiatives, new products and other growth opportunities. Capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development and improving information technology systems. In 2009, the Company expects capital spending to exceed $200 million, though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions. Net cash used in investing activities related to continuing operations was $3.4 billion in 2007 compared to approximately $2.8 billion in 2006. Gross capital spending increased $26 million in 2007 from 2006 levels to $162 million. As discussed below, the Company completed numerous business acquisitions and divestitures during 2008, 2007 and 2006. All of the acquisitions during this period have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Company’s financial statements. This goodwill typically arises because the purchase prices for these businesses reflect the competitive nature of the process by which the businesses are acquired and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these businesses are expected to bring to existing operations. For a discussion of other factors resulting in the recognition of goodwill see Notes 2 and 6 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 2008 Acquisitions The Company acquired seventeen companies or product lines during 2008 for consideration of approximately $423 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired and $8.5 million of debt assumed. Each company acquired manufactures instrumentation and/or supply products in the life sciences, dental, product identification, environmental or test and measurement markets. These companies were acquired to complement 47 Table of Contents existing units of the Medical Technologies, Industrial Technologies or Professional Instrumentation segments. The aggregate annual sales of these seventeen acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $325 million. 2007 Acquisitions and Divestiture In November 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Tektronix, Inc. for total cash consideration of approximately $2.8 billion, including transaction costs and net of cash and debt acquired. The Company initially financed the acquisition of Tektronix through the issuance of commercial paper and available cash (including proceeds from the underwritten public offering of 6.9 million shares of Danaher common stock completed on November 2, 2007). Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company issued $500 million of 5.625% senior notes due 2018 in an underwritten public offering and used the net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance the Tektronix acquisition. In July 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of ChemTreat for a cash purchase price of $425 million including transaction costs. No cash was acquired in the transaction. The Company financed the acquisition primarily with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and to a lesser extent from available cash. In addition, the Company acquired ten other companies or product lines during 2007 for consideration of approximately $273 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired, and $4 million of debt assumed. Each company acquired manufactures instrumentation and/or supply products in the test and measurement, dental technologies, product identification, sensors and controls or environmental instruments markets. These companies were all acquired to complement existing units of the Professional Instrumentation, Medical Technologies or Industrial Technologies segments. The aggregate annual sales of these ten acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $123 million. In addition to the ten acquisitions noted above, as discussed below, during the first quarter of 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining shares of Vision not owned by the Company as of December 31, 2006 for cash consideration of approximately $96 million. In July 2007, the Company completed the sale of its power quality business generating approximately $275 million of net cash proceeds. This business, which was part of the Industrial Technologies segment and designs and manufactures power quality and reliability products and services, had aggregate annual revenues of approximately $130 million in 2006. The Company used the proceeds from this sale for general corporate purposes, including debt reduction and acquisitions. 2006 Acquisitions In May 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Sybron for total cash consideration of approximately $2 billion, including transaction costs and net of $94 million of cash acquired, and assumed approximately $182 million of debt. Sybron is a leading manufacturer of a broad range of products for the dental professional and had revenues of approximately $650 million in its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition. Substantially all of the assumed debt was repaid or refinanced prior to December 31, 2006. Danaher financed the acquisition of shares and the refinancing of the assumed debt primarily with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and to a lesser extent from available cash. In addition, in the last quarter of 2006 and first quarter of 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Vision for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $525 million, including transaction costs and net of $113 million of cash acquired and assumed $1.5 million of debt. Of this purchase price, $96 million was paid during 2007 to acquire the remaining shares of Vision that the Company did not own as of December 31, 2006 and for transaction costs. The Company financed the transaction through a combination of available cash and the issuance of commercial paper. Vision, based in Australia, manufactures and markets automated instruments, antibodies and biochemical reagents used for biopsy-based detection of cancer and infectious diseases, and had revenues of $86 million in its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition. The pairing of Vision with the Company’s existing 48 Table of Contents life science instrumentation business, Leica, has significantly broadened the Company’s product offerings in the anatomical pathology market and has expanded the sales and growth opportunities for both the Leica and Vision businesses. The Company believes that the pairing of Leica and Vision also created a broader base for the potential acquisition of complementary businesses in the life sciences industry. Total consideration for the other nine businesses acquired during 2006 was approximately $213 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired. In general, each manufactures instrumentation and/or supply products in the test and measurement, acute care diagnostics, water quality, product identification or sensors and controls markets. These companies were all acquired to complement existing units of the Professional Instrumentation, Medical Technologies or Industrial Technologies segments. The aggregate annual revenues of these nine acquired businesses, at the date of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the acquired company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $140 million. In the first half of 2006, the Company purchased and subsequently sold shares of First Technology plc, a U.K.—based public company, in connection with the Company’s unsuccessful bid to acquire First Technology. First Technology also paid the Company a break-up fee of approximately $3 million. During the second quarter of 2006 the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $14 million ($8.9 million after-tax, or approximately $0.03 per diluted share) in connection with these matters, net of related transaction costs, which is included in “other expense (income), net” in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Statement of Earnings. Financing Activities and Indebtedness Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper, common stock and notes, repayments of indebtedness, repurchases of common stock and payments of dividends to shareholders. Financing activities used cash of $1.1 billion during 2008 compared to $1.7 billion of cash provided during 2007. The year-over-year change was primarily due to repayment of a substantial portion of the commercial paper indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisitions of Tektronix and ChemTreat in 2007; the repurchase of shares of Danaher common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program; repayment of the $250 million aggregate principal amount of 6.1% notes due 2008 (net of commercial paper issued to refinance such repayment); and dividends paid during 2008. Total debt was $2,619 million at December 31, 2008 compared to $3,726 million at December 31, 2007. The Company’s debt as of December 31, 2008 was as follows: • $624 million of outstanding U.S. dollar denominated commercial paper; • $699 million (€500 million) aggregate principal amount of 4.5% guaranteed Eurobond Notes due 2013 (“Eurobond Notes”); • $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2018 (“2018 Notes”); • $620 million of zero coupon Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2021 (“LYONs”); and • $176 million of other borrowings. The Company does not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt, except in connection with the change of control triggers described as follows. Under each of the Eurobond Notes and the 2018 Notes, if the Company experiences a change of control and a rating downgrade of a specified nature within a specified period following the change of control, the Company will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of 2018 Notes, or the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of Eurobond Notes. The Company’s outstanding indentures and comparable instruments also contain customary covenants including for example limits on the incurrence of secured debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to the Company’s operations and as of December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants. For a discussion of the risks related to our indebtedness, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” 49 Table of Contents Commercial Paper Program and Credit Facility The Company satisfies its short-term liquidity needs primarily through issuances of U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper. Under the Company’s U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper programs, the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes in aggregate principal amount not to exceed $4.0 billion. Since the Credit Facility (described below) provides credit support for the program, the $1.45 billion of availability under the Credit Facility has the practical effect of reducing from $4.0 billion to $1.45 billion the maximum amount of commercial paper that the Company can issue under the program. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 90 days from the date of issuance. Borrowings under the program are available for general corporate purposes, including financing acquisitions. The Company classifies the borrowings under the commercial paper program as long-term borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company has the intent and the ability, as supported by the availability of the Credit Facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date. Credit support for part of the commercial paper program is provided by an unsecured $1.45 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) which expires on April 25, 2012. The Credit Facility can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Interest is based on, at the Company’s option, (1) a LIBOR-based formula that is dependent in part on the Company’s credit rating, or (2) a formula based on Bank of America’s prime rate or on the Federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, or (3) the rate of interest bid by a particular lender for a particular loan under the facility. The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus shareholders’ equity) as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of 0.65 to 1.00 or less. The availability of the Credit Facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of our commercial paper program. We expect to limit any borrowings under the Credit Facility to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow, if needed, to repay all of our outstanding commercial paper as it matures. During 2008, the Company utilized its commercial paper program to finance the repayment of the 6.1% notes due 2008. During 2007, the Company utilized its commercial paper program (as well as operating cash flow and the proceeds from the November 2007 common stock offering and December 2007 offering of the 2018 Notes), to fund the acquisitions of ChemTreat and Tektronix. As of December 31, 2008, $624 million was outstanding under the Company’s U.S. dollar commercial paper program with a weighted average interest rate of 1.0% and an average maturity of approximately 13 days. As of December 31, 2008, there was no outstanding Euro-denominated commercial paper. Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related costs of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Any downgrade in the Company’s credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the Company’s commercial paper program and Credit Facility, and could limit or preclude the Company’s ability to issue commercial paper. We have not experienced difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market to date. If our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, we would expect to rely on a combination of available operating cash flow and our Credit Facility to provide short-term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under our Credit Facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings. In connection with the financing of the Tektronix acquisition in November 2007, the Company entered into a $1.9 billion unsecured revolving bridge loan facility (the “Bridge Facility”), which provided additional credit support for the commercial paper program and was also available for working capital and other corporate purposes. In December 2007, Danaher reduced the amount of the Bridge Facility to $1.0 billion to minimize maintenance costs, and in May 2008 Danaher further reduced the facility to $0.5 billion. The Bridge Facility expired on November 11, 2008. There were no borrowings under either the Credit Facility or the Bridge Facility during 2008. Other Long-Term Indebtedness In December 2007, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2018. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, were 50 Table of Contents approximately $493.4 million, which were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance the acquisition of Tektronix. The Company may redeem the notes at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest plus 25 basis points. On July 21, 2006, a financing subsidiary of the Company issued the Eurobond Notes in a private placement outside the U.S. Payment obligations under these Eurobond Notes are guaranteed by the Company. The net proceeds of the offering, after the deduction of underwriting commissions but prior to the deduction of other issuance costs, were €496 million ($627 million based on exchange rates in effect at the time the offering closed) and were used to pay down a portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The Company may redeem the notes upon the occurrence of specified, adverse changes in tax laws or interpretations under such laws, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed. In 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in LYONs. The net proceeds to the Company were $505 million, of which approximately $100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The LYONs carry a yield to maturity of 2.375% (with contingent interest payable as described below). Holders of the LYONs may convert each $1,000 of principal amount at maturity into 14.5352 shares of Danaher common stock (in the aggregate for all LYONs, approximately 12.0 million shares of Danaher common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January 22, 2021. As of December 31, 2008, an aggregate of approximately 68,000 shares of Danaher common stock had been issued upon conversion of LYONs. As of December 31, 2008, the accreted value of the outstanding LYONs was lower than the traded market value of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time at scheduled redemption prices. Holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash and/or Company common stock, at the Company’s option, on January 22, 2011. The holders had a similar option to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes as of January 22, 2004, which resulted in notes with an accreted value of $1.1 million being redeemed by the Company for cash. Under the terms of the LYONs, the Company will pay contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six month period from January 23 to July 22 and from July 23 to January 22 if the average market price of a LYON for a specified measurement period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. The amount of contingent interest to be paid with respect to any quarterly period is equal to the higher of either 0.0315% of the bonds’ average market price during the specified measurement period or the amount of the common stock dividend paid during such quarterly period multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon conversion of a LYON. The Company paid approximately $1.4 million of contingent interest on the LYONs for the year ended December 31, 2008. Except for the contingent interest described above, the Company will not pay interest on the LYONs prior to maturity. The $250 million of 6.1% notes due 2008 matured October 15, 2008 and were repaid from the proceeds of commercial paper borrowings. Shelf Registration Statement and Common Stock Offering The Company has a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance. In November 2007, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 6.9 million shares of Danaher common stock at a price to the public of $82.25 per share off the shelf registration statement. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, were approximately $550 million, which were used to partially fund the acquisition of Tektronix. In December 2007, the Company also issued the 5.625% Senior Notes due 2018 off the shelf registration statement. Stock Repurchase Program On April 21, 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of the Company’s common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. There is no 51 Table of Contents expiration date for the Company’s repurchase program. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by the Company’s management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Company’s equity compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. During 2008, the Company repurchased 1.38 million shares of Company common stock in open market transactions at a cost of $74 million. During 2007, the Company repurchased 1.64 million shares of Company common stock in open market transactions at a cost of $117 million. The 2008 and 2007 repurchases were funded from available cash and from proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. At December 31, 2008, the Company had approximately 2 million shares remaining for stock repurchases under the existing Board authorization. The Company expects to fund any further repurchases using the Company’s available cash balances or proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. Dividends The Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.03 per share that was paid on January 30, 2009 to holders of record on December 26, 2008. Aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2008 were $38 million. Cash and Cash Requirements The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures and acquisitions, to pay interest and service debt, fund its pension plans as required, pay dividends to shareholders and repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements and may borrow under existing commercial paper programs or the Credit Facility or, subject to availability, access the capital markets as needed for liquidity. Subject to market conditions and management’s judgment, the Company intends to seek to publicly issue debt securities prior to the end of the first quarter of 2009, the proceeds of which would be used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper and/or for other general, corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2008, the Company held $393 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less. Of this amount, approximately $373 million was held outside the United States; repatriation of these amounts is either restricted or prohibited by local laws and/or would potentially trigger United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits, as discussed below. The Company’s cash balances are generated and held in numerous locations throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside the United States. The Company utilizes a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that its worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. Wherever possible, cash management is centralized and intra-company financing is used to provide working capital to the Company’s operations. Most of the cash balances held outside the United States could be repatriated to the United States, but, under current law, would potentially be subject to United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted or prohibited by local laws. Where local restrictions prevent an efficient intra-company transfer of funds, the Company’s intent is that cash balances would remain in the foreign country and it would meet United States liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both. The provisions of the U.S. Pension Protection Act of 2006, enacted in August 2006 changed the minimum funding requirements for the Company’s U.S. pension plan beginning in 2009. During 2009, the Company’s cash contribution requirements for its U.S. pension plan are not expected to be significant. Funding requirements for the U.S. pension may become more significant commencing in the year ended December 31, 2010; however, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, underlying asset returns and the impact of recent legislative activity associated with pension funding obligations. Cash contributions during 2009 related to the Company’s non-U.S. pension plans are expected to be approximately $30 million. 52 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 under (1) long-term debt obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company’s balance sheet under GAAP. The amounts presented in the table below do not reflect $536 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits.

(b) Amounts do not include interest payments. Interest on long-term debt and capital lease obligations is reflected in a separate line in the table. (c) Interest payments on long-term debt are projected for future periods using the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2008. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates. (d) As described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (e) Consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. (f) Primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies and allowances, performance and operating costs guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs, self-insurance and litigation claims, post-retirement benefits, certain pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities and deferred compensation obligations. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations are based upon management’s estimates over the terms of these arrangements and are largely based upon historical experience. 53 Table of Contents OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of off-balance sheet commercial commitments of the Company. Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period TotalAmountsCommitted LessThanOneYear 1-3Years 4-5Years MoreThan5 Years ($ in millions) Standby Letters of Credit and Performance Bonds $ 255.1 $ 120.9 $ 85.5 $ 17.1 $ 31.6 Guarantees 172.1 84.9 5.3 1.3 80.6 Contingent Acquisition Consideration 72.4 40.1 7.6 5.1 19.6 Total $ 499.6 $ 245.9 $ 98.4 $ 23.5 $ 131.8 Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are generally issued to secure the Company’s obligations under short-term contracts to purchase raw materials and components for manufacture and for performance under specific manufacturing agreements. Guarantees are generally issued in connection with certain transactions with vendors, suppliers, and financing counterparties and governmental entities. In connection with five acquisitions, the Company has entered into agreements with the respective sellers to pay certain amounts in the future as additional purchase price. The Company enters into these types of arrangements to help bridge differences of opinion that the Company and the sellers may have over the appropriate value of the acquired business. The Company could pay nothing in the aggregate pursuant to these agreements, or a maximum of up to $72.4 million over the next 15 years depending on the performance of the respective businesses during the specified performance period. Other Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements The Company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters or tax matters. The Company cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations, warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the Company does not believe that the liabilities relating to these representations, warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Due to the Company’s downsizing of certain operations pursuant to acquisitions, restructuring plans or otherwise, certain properties leased by the Company have been sublet to third parties. In the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by such sub-lessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The Company’s Certificate of Incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the Company, or by reason of serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to limited exceptions. Danaher’s Amended and Restated By-laws provide for similar indemnification rights. In addition, Danaher intends to execute with each of its directors and executive officers an indemnification agreement with Danaher which will provide for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which Danaher will agree to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding. While the Company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage. 54 Table of Contents Except as described above, as of December 31, 2008 the Company has not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements and has no unconsolidated special purpose entities. Legal Proceedings Please refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding certain litigation matters. In addition to the litigation matters noted under “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters – Environmental, Health & Safety”, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation incidental to its business. These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Company’s products and services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, personal injury and insurance coverage. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, divested businesses. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive and consequential as well as compensatory damages. While the Company maintains workers compensation, property, cargo, automobile, aviation, crime, fiduciary, product, general liability, and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (and has acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions) that it believes cover a portion of these claims, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses. In addition, while the Company believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims, these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses. Based upon the Company’s experience, current information and applicable law, it does not believe that these proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on its cash flows, financial position, or results of operations. The Company maintains third party insurance policies up to certain limits to cover certain liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts. For general liability risk (which includes product liability) and most other insured risks, the Company purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses (“stop loss” insurance) and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to amounts within the self-insured retention. These reserves consist of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts for anticipated developments of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims. The specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified with the assistance of outside risk insurance professionals for product liability. In addition, outside risk insurances professionals assist in the determination of reserves for incurred but not yet reported claims through evaluation of the Company’s specific loss history, actual claims reported, and industry trends among statistical and other factors. While the Company actively pursues financial recoveries from insurance providers for claims paid associated with these risks, it does not recognize any recoveries until realized or until such time as a sustained pattern of collections is established related to historical matters of a similar nature and magnitude. The Company believes the liability recorded for such risk insurance reserves as of December 31, 2008 is adequate, but due to judgments inherent in the reserve process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate. If the risk insurance reserves established are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s net earnings. Please see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the amount of our accruals for self-insurance and litigation liability. For a discussion of additional risks related to existing and potential legal proceedings, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 55 Table of Contents The Company believes the following critical accounting policies are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, refer to Note 1 in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounts receivable. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company’s customers to make required payments. The Company estimates its anticipated losses from doubtful accounts based on historical collection history as well as by specifically reserving for known doubtful accounts. Estimating losses from doubtful accounts is inherently uncertain because the amount of such losses depends substantially on the financial condition of the Company’s customers, and the Company typically has limited visibility as to the specific financial state of its customers. Recent deterioration in overall global economic conditions and worldwide credit markets heightens the uncertainties related to customers’ ability to pay and may increase the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate beyond estimates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, the Company would be required to write off additional accounts receivable balances, which would adversely impact the Company’s net earnings and financial condition. Inventories. The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market value. The Company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand, technological advances and pricing competition in many of the Company’s markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the Company’s control. As a result, such fluctuations can be difficult to predict. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, the Company could be required to reduce the value of its inventory, which would adversely impact the Company’s net earnings and financial condition. Acquired intangibles. The Company’s business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the Company will incur. The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, the accounting standard for goodwill, which requires that the Company, on an annual basis, calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists. Impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using various valuation techniques with the initial estimate being calculated using a market based approach where fair value is estimated based on EBITDA multiples determined by available precedent transactions of comparable businesses. In evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach, management assesses the relevance and reliability of the precedent transaction EBITDA multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including recent operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and other market data. To the extent the fair value as estimated by the market based approach exceeds the carrying value of a reporting unit by less than 30%, management performs an analysis using the income approach to estimate fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis related to that reporting unit. Once completed, the results of the income and market approaches are reconciled and compared. The discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. While the Company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis, as described above, did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units as of the first day of the Company’s fiscal fourth quarter, the annual testing date, ranged from approximately 1.4% to approximately 421%. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. The results (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the 56 Table of Contents respective reporting unit) from this hypothetical 10% decrease in fair value ranged from a short fall of approximately 9% to an excess of approximately 369% for each of the Company’s reporting units. The carrying value of the Company’s individual reporting units ranges from approximately $13 million to approximately $2.5 billion. Long-lived assets. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. Judgments made by the Company relate to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and its ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets and are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and anticipated future cash flows. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of long-lived assets, there is risk that the carrying value of the Company’s long-lived assets may require adjustment in future periods. If actual fair value is less than the Company’s estimates, long-lived assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings. Purchase accounting. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company formulates a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 95-3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination (EITF No. 95-3), the Company accrues estimates for certain of the integration costs anticipated at the date of acquisition, including personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings. Adjustments to these estimates are made up to 12 months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized. The Company establishes these accruals based on information obtained during the due diligence process, the Company’s experience in acquiring other companies, and information obtained after the closing about the acquired company’s business, assets and liabilities. The accruals established by the Company are inherently uncertain because they are based on limited information on the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired business as well as the uncertainty of the cost to execute the restructuring plans for the business. If the accruals established by the Company are insufficient to account for all of the activities required to restructure the acquired entity, the Company would be required to incur an expense, which would adversely affect the Company’s net earnings. To the extent these accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose, the excess is recorded as a reduction of the purchase price, typically by reducing recorded goodwill balances. As a result of the implementation of SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations,” that became effective January 1, 2009, the provisions of EITF 95-3 will not be applicable to acquisitions completed subsequent to January 1, 2009. Acquisitions completed prior to December 31, 2008 will continue to apply the provisions of EITF 95-3. Refer to “New Accounting Standards” below for additional information. Environmental. The Company has made a provision for environmental remediation and environmental-related personal injury claims with respect to sites owned or formerly owned by the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company generally makes an assessment of the costs involved for its remediation efforts based on environmental studies as well as its prior experience with similar sites. If the Company determines that potential remediation liability for properties currently or previously owned is probable and reasonably estimable, it accrues the total estimated costs, including investigation and remediation costs, associated with the site. We also estimate our exposure for probable environmental-related personal injury claims and accrue for this estimated liability. While the Company actively pursues insurance recoveries as well as recoveries from other potentially responsible parties, it does not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realization is deemed probable. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of the Company’s involvement in certain sites, uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the availability of alternative cleanup methods, variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations. As such, there can be no assurance that the Company’s estimates of environmental liabilities will not change. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. If the environmental reserves established by the Company are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s net earnings. 57 Table of Contents Contingent Liabilities. As discussed above, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation incidental to its business. The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company periodically assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes for these matters, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and if appropriate, recognizes a liability for these contingencies with the assistance of legal counsel and, if applicable, other professionals. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments or changes in the Company’s settlement strategy. For a discussion of these contingencies, including management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of specific liabilities, refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. If the reserves established by the Company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s net earnings. As discussed above under “—Legal Proceedings”, the Company maintains third party insurance policies up to certain limits to cover certain liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts for these liabilities and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to amounts within the self-insured retention. Please see “—Legal Proceedings” for a discussion of how reserves are established for self-insurance and litigation liability. The Company believes the liability recorded for such risk insurance reserves as of December 31, 2008 is adequate, but due to judgments inherent in the reserve process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate. If the risk insurance reserves established are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s net earnings. Revenue Recognition: The Company derives revenues primarily from the sale of professional, industrial, medical and consumer products and services. For revenue related to a product or service to qualify for recognition, there must be persuasive evidence of a sale, delivery must have occurred or the services must have been rendered, the price to the customer must be fixed and determinable and collectibility of the balance must be reasonably assured. The Company’s standard terms of sale are FOB Shipping Point and, as such, the Company principally records revenue for product sale upon shipment. If any significant obligations to the customer with respect to such sale remain to be fulfilled following shipment, typically involving obligations relating to installation and acceptance by the buyer, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled. Product returns consist of estimated returns for products sold and are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale as required by SFAS No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists. Customer allowances and rebates, consisting primarily of volume discounts and other short-term incentive programs, are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale because these allowances reflect a reduction in the purchase price for the products purchased in accordance with EITF 01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of a Vendor’s Products). Product returns, customer allowances and rebates are estimated based on historical experience and known trends. Revenue related to maintenance agreements is recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement as required by FASB Technical Bulletin 90-1, Accounting for Separately Priced Extended Warranty and Product Maintenance Contracts. Revenues for contractual arrangements with multiple elements are allocated pursuant to Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. In the case of arrangements that include more than incidental software, the provisions of AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions, are applied. Revenues are recognized for the separate elements when the product or services have value on a stand-alone basis, fair value of the separate elements exist (or in the case of software related products, vendor specific objective evidence of fair value) and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in the Company’s control. While determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are identifiable as those elements are also sold unaccompanied by other elements. Share-Based Compensation: The Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, which requires the Company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted, including stock options, 58 Table of Contents RSUs and restricted shares, based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, the Company recognizes equity-based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognizes compensation cost for only those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the share-based payment awards and stock price volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management’s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our equity-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the equity-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits: Certain of the Company’s employees and retired employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans (pension plans) and certain eligible retirees are provided health care and life insurance benefits under postretirement benefit plans (postretirement plans). The Company accounts for its pension and postretirement plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers’ Accounting for Pensions; SFAS No. 106, Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions; and SFAS No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 106 require that the amounts the Company records, including the expense or income, associated with the pension and postretirement plans is computed using actuarial valuations. Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations. These include assumptions the Company makes relating to financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions used by the Company. The assumptions used in the actuarial valuation include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may affect the Company’s financial position or results of operations. For the United States plan, the Company used a 6.25% discount rate in computing the amount of the minimum pension liability to be recorded at December 31, 2008, which represents an increase of 25 basis points in the discount rate from December 31, 2007. For non-U.S. plans, rates appropriate for each plan are determined based on investment grade instruments with maturities approximately equal to the average expected benefit payout under the plan. A 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate used for the plans would have increased the U.S. and non-U.S. net obligation by $58 million ($38 million on an after tax basis) from the amount recorded in the financial statements at December 31, 2008. For 2008, the expected long-term rate of return assumption applicable to assets held in the United States plan was estimated at 8% which is the same as the rate used in 2007. This expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected long-term returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets. The U.S. plan targets to invest between 60% and 70% of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments. The balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in corporate bonds and bond index funds. Pension benefit for the U.S. plan for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $5 million (or $3 million on an after-tax basis), compared with pension expense of $13 million (or $8 million on an after-tax basis) for this plan in 2007. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was reduced by 0.5%, pension expense for 2008 would have increased $6 million (or $4 million on an after-tax basis). The Company made no contributions to the U.S. plan in 2008. The Company’s non-U.S. plan assets are comprised of various insurance contracts, equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan. The estimated long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 1.5% to 8.25% for 2008 and ranged from 0.75% to 7.5% for 2007. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R).” This statement requires a 59 Table of Contents company to (a) recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan’s over funded status or a liability for a plan’s under funded status; (b) measure a plan’s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer’s fiscal year, and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur (reported in comprehensive income). The requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements were effective and adopted by the Company as of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. The adoption of the recognition provisions of the standard reduced the amount of pension and other post-retirement liabilities as of December 31, 2006 by approximately $23 million and increased stockholders equity by approximately $15.6 million due to the recognition of previously unrecognized, over-funded positions in certain of the Company’s non-US pension plans and due to the recognition of actuarially determined prior service credits associated with the Company’s U.S. based retiree benefit program. The requirement to measure the plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year–end statement of financial position was effective and adopted by the Company as of the year ended December 31, 2008. Prior to adoption of the measurement date provisions, the majority of the Company’s pension and postretirement plans used a September 30 measurement date. The adoption of the measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158 increased long-term liabilities by approximately $6 million and decreased stockholders’ equity by approximately $4 million. There was no effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows. The provisions of the U.S. Pension Protection Act of 2006, enacted in August 2006 changed the minimum funding requirements for the Company’s U.S. pension plan beginning in 2009. During 2009, the Company’s cash contribution requirements for its U.S. pension plan are not expected to be significant. Funding requirements for the U.S. pension may become more significant commencing in the year ending December 31, 2010; however, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, underlying asset returns and the impact of recent legislative activity associated with pension funding obligations. Cash contributions during 2009 related to the Company’s non-U.S. pension plans are expected to be approximately $30 million. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (SFAS No. 141R) and SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements” (“SFAS No. 160”). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 160 clarifies the classification of noncontrolling interests in the financial statements and the accounting for and reporting of transactions between the reporting entity and holders of such noncontrolling interests. SFAS No. 141R and SFAS No. 160 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and impacts the accounting for acquisitions completed after January 1, 2009. The adoption of SFAS No. 141R will likely have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations, however, the magnitude of that impact is dependent on the frequency and relative size of the acquisitions completed by the Company. In general, more frequent acquisition activity and relatively larger acquisitions will have a more significant impact. The adoption of SFAS No. 160 on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations is not expected to be significant. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. It also responds to investors’ requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS No. 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value, and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS No. 157 was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards that require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair 60 Table of Contents value. Under SFAS No. 159, a company may elect to use fair value to measure accounts and loans receivable, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, equity method investments, accounts payable, guarantees and issued debt. Other eligible items include firm commitments for financial instruments that otherwise would not be recognized at inception and non-cash warranty obligations where a warrantor is permitted to pay a third party to provide the warranty goods or services. If the use of fair value is elected, any upfront costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred, such as debt issuance costs. The fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an instrument-by-instrument basis, even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value. At the adoption date, unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings. Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 159, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 159 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48) “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”, to clarify certain aspects of accounting for uncertain tax positions, including issues related to the recognition and measurement of those tax positions. The Company adopted FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007, as required. As a result of the implementation, the Company recognized a decrease of $63 million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as an increase to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings.

RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as U.S. and non-U.S. economic and financial market conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Our business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. Although conditions in the global economy and financial markets have improved in the last several months, the deterioration in worldwide economic conditions and volatility in and tightening of the capital and credit markets that began in the latter half of 2008 has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company and its distributors, customers and suppliers. These conditions have had, and may in the future have, the effect of: • reducing demand for our products and services, increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies; • increasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories; • increasing price competition in our served markets; • resulting in supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; • increasing the risk of impairment of long-lived assets due to underutilized manufacturing capacity; and • increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which, in addition to increasing the risks identified above, could result in preference actions against us. We have initiated several restructuring actions to adjust our cost structure to reflect changing demand levels, but there can be no assurances these or any other cost-reduction actions will be successful in effectively matching our cost structure to levels of demand. In addition, although we have been able to continue accessing the commercial paper markets through the date of this report, there can be no assurances that the commercial paper markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facility will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations. The restructuring actions that we are taking to reduce costs could have long-term adverse effects on our business. Since October 2008, we have announced multiple significant restructuring activities across our businesses with the objective of adjusting our cost structure to reflect changing demand levels. These restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities have the effect of reducing our available talent, assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and technologies, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers, limit our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases, and limit our ability to hire and retain key personnel. These circumstances could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve, and visibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and profits are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability. In addition, certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns that 16 Table of Contents adversely impact demand for the equipment and services that we sell. Competitive pricing pressures, slowdowns in capital investments and other downturns in these industries could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in any given period. We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may face decreased demand or price reductions for our products. Our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive. Because of the diversity of products we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors; please see “Item 1. Business – Competition” for additional details. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services designed to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product categories and penetrating new markets, including in developing countries. Our failure to compete effectively may reduce our revenues, profitability and cash flow, and pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our profitability. Our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation. We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation on a timely basis, our products will become technologically obsolete over time and our revenues, cash flow, profitability and competitive position will suffer. Our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to: • correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences; • allocate our research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects; • anticipate and respond to our competitors’ development of new products and technological innovations; • differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings; • innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets; • obtain adequate intellectual property rights; • successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and manufacture and deliver new products in sufficient volumes on time; and • encourage customers to adopt new technologies. In addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. Any inability to consummate acquisitions at our prior rate could negatively impact our growth rate. We may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price. Promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including high valuations, the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets, competition among prospective buyers and the need for regulatory, including antitrust, approvals. Changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or uncertainty in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions. Our ability to grow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate companies and businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated cost savings. Our acquisition of businesses could negatively impact our profitability and return on invested capital. As part of our business strategy we acquire businesses in the ordinary course, some of which may be material; please see the section titled “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Investing Activities” in the MD&A for additional details. Our acquisitions involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational and other risks and challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability: • Any acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it, or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable. 17 Table of Contents • Acquisitions could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long-term. • Acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results in any given fiscal period, and the impact may be substantially different from period to period. • Acquisitions could place unanticipated demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. • We could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other systems. • We may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition. • We may assume by acquisition unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, or internal control deficiencies. The realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. • As a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded significant goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets on our balance sheet. If we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets. In addition, future divestitures could negatively impact the Company’s results of operations. The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities. Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may not be able to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position. Contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We have retained responsibility for some of the known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold, such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims and environmental matters, and have agreed to indemnify the purchasers of these businesses for certain known and unknown contingent liabilities. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue. We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. At December 31, 2009, the net carrying value of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment, goodwill, other intangible assets and other long-term assets) totaled approximately $14.4 billion. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to these assets. Any such impairment charges could adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized. Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which may have an adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices, and also 18 Table of Contents decrease our reported revenues or margins in respect of sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could have an adverse effect on the cost of materials, products and services purchased overseas. In addition, our sales and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into U.S. dollars. Our reputation and our ability to do business may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners. We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties against us or our subsidiaries, and could damage our reputation. Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Please see the section titled “Income Taxes” in the MD&A for a discussion of the factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period. The impact of these factors may be substantially different from period to period. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. Due to the ambiguity of tax laws and the subjectivity of factual interpretations, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. If these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities. The Obama administration has announced proposals to tax profits of U.S. companies earned abroad. While it is impossible for us to predict whether these and other proposals will be implemented, or how they will ultimately impact us, they may adversely impact our results of operations. If we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights. We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our operations. The intellectual property rights that we obtain, however, may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. In addition, the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented or designed-around, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. Our failure or inability to obtain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property, could adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights. 19 Table of Contents Third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services. From time to time, we receive notices from third parties regarding intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. Any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to critical technology, be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our competitive position, revenues, profitability and cash flows. Even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows. We are subject to a variety of litigation in the course of our business that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to our business, including claims for damages arising out of the use of our products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition-related matters. These lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our financial condition, operations and results of operations. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. In addition, developments in legal proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, or make estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, which could adversely affect our results of operations in any particular period. Our operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental liabilities, costs, litigation and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and reputation. Certain of our operations, products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water and establish standards for the use, generation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the U.S. and abroad in connection with our operations. We cannot assure you that our environmental, health and safety compliance program has been or will be at all times effective. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. For additional information regarding these risks, please refer to “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters.” We cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and reputation or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. Product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations. Manufacturing or design defects, unanticipated use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products, and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. A recall could result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us. 20 Table of Contents Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and reputation. In addition to the environmental regulations noted above, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the federal, state and local levels, including the following: • We are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons and dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies, and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory. • Certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the FDA, by comparable agencies of other countries and by regulations governing the management, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain clearance for our new products or modifications to existing products, and if we do such clearance may be time-consuming, costly and restrictive. Violations of these regulations, efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products can lead to warning letters, declining sales, recalls, seizures, injunctions, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, suspension or withdrawal of approvals and pre-market notification rescissions. In addition, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. • We also have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. Our agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification at the convenience of the government or in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors. Government contracts that have been awarded to us following a bid process could become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder, which could result in loss of the contract. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting. These are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. Failure to comply with these or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to manufacture, import and export products and services, and damage to our reputation. Compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses. Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the ISO, and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our results of operations. For additional information regarding these risks, please refer to “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters.” Our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow, and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $2.9 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we had the ability to incur an additional $1.3 billion of indebtedness under our outstanding commercial paper facilities. We may also incur additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: • requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions, capital investment and stock repurchases; 21 Table of Contents • reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and • exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. We may incur significantly more debt in the future, particularly in connection with acquisitions. If we add new debt, the risks described above could increase. Our current revolving credit facilities impose restrictions on us, including certain restrictions on our ability to incur liens on our assets, and require us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus shareholders’ equity) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of 0.65 to 1.0 or less. In addition, our long-term debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our expenses and funding obligations relating to our defined benefit pension plans. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. For example, the declines in the global capital markets since the first half of 2008 have resulted in significant declines in the fair value of our pension plan assets. We may incur higher costs to produce our products if commodity prices rise. As discussed in “Item 1. Business – Materials,” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of raw materials. Over the last two years, the prices of raw materials have been volatile. Due to the highly competitive nature of the industries which we serve and the cost-containment efforts of our customers, if commodity prices rise we may be unable to fully pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we are unable to fully recover higher raw material costs through price increases or offset these increases through other cost reductions, or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs, we could experience lower margins and profitability and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. If we cannot adjust our purchases of materials, components and equipment required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changing market conditions or customer demand, our income and results of operations may suffer. We purchase materials, components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations. Our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations. During a market upturn, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices. If we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand, we may not be able to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed or our material or manufacturing costs may increase. Conversely, in order to secure supplies for the production of products, we sometimes enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer. 22 Table of Contents In addition, some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness or availability. If these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we could face manufacturing or sourcing interruptions, delays and inefficiencies. If we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity to reflect the demand for our products, our income and results of operations may suffer. Because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements. Any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results. Changes in governmental regulations and funding may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as health and safety, environmental and food and drug regulations and regulations governing communications. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Any significant change in any of these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products. In addition, in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations. In these markets, the failure of governmental and other entities to adopt new regulations, or the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address, could adversely affect our growth rate. We may be unable to adjust to changes in the healthcare industry, some of which could adversely affect our business. The healthcare industry has undergone, and is in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs. These changes include legislative healthcare reform, wider implementation of managed care, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates. Some of these potential changes may cause healthcare-industry participants to purchase fewer of our products and services, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services, reduce the amounts of reimbursement available for our products from governmental agencies or third-party payors, reduce the volume of medical procedures or impose excise taxes on medical device companies. These changes could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Work stoppages, union and works council campaigns, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force could adversely impact our results of operations and cause us to incur incremental costs. We have a number of U.S. collective bargaining units and various non-U.S. collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and potential labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations. Adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns of, key distributors, resellers and other channel partners could adversely affect our results of operations. Certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors, resellers and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and end-users. Some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products, and if they favor our competitors’ products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. Adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners, or adverse developments in their financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Changes in the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period. In addition, the consolidation of distributors in certain of our served industries, as well as the formation of large and sophisticated purchasing groups in industries such as healthcare, could adversely impact our profitability. 23 Table of Contents International economic, political, legal and business factors could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In 2009, approximately 52% of our sales were derived from customers outside the U.S. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located outside the U.S. Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the U.S. and increase the localization of our products and services, we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the U.S., particularly in emerging markets. Our international business is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations, including: • interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers; • differences in terms of sale, including payment terms; • changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions; • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; • unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including negative changes in tax laws; • limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings; • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; • differing labor regulations; • differing protection of intellectual property; and • wars and terrorist activities and the U.S. and international response thereto. Any of these risks could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and growth. If we suffer loss to our facilities, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed. Our facilities, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. If any of these facilities or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate headquarters are located in Washington, D.C. in a facility that we lease. At December 31, 2009, we had approximately 213 significant manufacturing and distribution facilities worldwide. 102 of these facilities are located in the United States and 111 are located outside the United States, primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia, the rest of North America, Latin America and Australia. These facilities cover approximately 20 million square feet, of which approximately 12 million square feet are owned and approximately 8 million square feet are leased. Particularly outside the United States, facilities often serve more than one business segment and may be used for multiple purposes, such as administrative, sales, manufacturing, warehousing and/or distribution. The number of significant facilities by business segment is: • Professional Instrumentation, 68; • Medical Technologies, 55; • Industrial Technologies, 63; and • Tools & Components, 27. We consider our facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used and do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. Please refer to Note 12 in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information with respect to our lease commitments. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 3.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide a reader of Danaher’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of Company management. The Company’s MD&A is divided into four main sections: • Overview • Results of Operations • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Critical Accounting Policies OVERVIEW General Please see “Item 1. Business – General” for a discussion of Danaher’s objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value. Danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations. During 2009, approximately 52% of Danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the United States. As a global business, Danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors. For example, in those industry segments where the Company is a capital equipment provider, revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of the Company’s customers, who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy. Danaher’s geographic and industry diversity, as well as the diversity of its products and services, typically helps limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results. However, the broad impact of the worldwide credit market turmoil and economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 negatively impacted the results of operations of most of the Company’s businesses. Given the broad range of products manufactured and geographies served, management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the Company. The Company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future. As a result of our geographic and industry diversity we face a variety of challenges and opportunities, including rapid technological development in most of our served markets, the expansion of opportunities in emerging markets, trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force and consolidation of our competitors. We operate in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and our long-term growth will depend in particular on our ability to expand our business (including through geographical and product line expansion), identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative new products with higher gross profit margins and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness. We are making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in our served markets and to globalize our manufacturing and customer facing resources in order to be responsive to our customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of our operations. Business Performance During 2009, lower spending and investment by both businesses and consumers resulted in a substantial decline in demand for most of the Company’s products. These conditions began in the third quarter of 2008 as global financial markets were in turmoil and continued throughout 2009. Demand stabilized in most businesses in the fourth quarter of 2009. Sales declined across all segments and major geographic regions, particularly in the United States and Europe. Unfavorable foreign currency translation also negatively impacted results for the year due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar as compared with 2008. Given the difficult economic environment, the Company implemented significant restructuring actions to rationalize its cost structure to a level appropriate for the conditions (refer Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Despite the challenging environment, the operating margin impacts of lower sales levels and restructuring costs were partially offset by the benefits of 2008 and 2009 restructuring actions, other productivity improvements, higher pricing in certain markets and lower material costs. The Company also generated operating cash flow near the same level as 2008 primarily by reducing inventory levels to reflect the lower levels of customer demand and by effectively managing accounts receivable. The Company also took advantage of an improving acquisition market in 2009 by consummating fifteen acquisitions, as discussed below, and signing definitive agreements to acquire an additional three businesses. 29 Table of Contents Acquisitions The Company acquired fifteen businesses during 2009 for consideration of approximately $704 million in cash, net of cash acquired. These businesses were acquired to complement existing units of the Medical Technologies, Professional Instrumentation and Industrial Technologies segments. The aggregate annual sales of these fifteen acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $430 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, the Company completed the previously announced acquisition of the Analytical Technologies division of MDS, which includes a 50% ownership position in the Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex joint venture (“AB SCIEX”), a mass spectrometry business, and a 100% ownership position in the Molecular Devices Corporation, a bioresearch and analytical instrumentation company. In a separate, but related transaction, the Company simultaneously completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership position in AB SCIEX from Life Technologies Corporation. The aggregate purchase price for the combined transactions was $1.1 billion, including debt assumed and net of cash acquired. AB SCIEX and Molecular Devices Corporation now operate within the Company’s Medical Technologies segment, and are expected to increase the Medical Technologies segment’s annual revenues by approximately $650 million. The acquisition of AB SCIEX significantly expands the Company’s position in the life sciences and diagnostics business and in particular establishes a position in the mass spectrometry market. AB SCIEX is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities in the Company’s Medical Technologies segment, both through the growth of existing products and services and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses. Company management and other personnel are devoting significant resources to the successful integration of the acquired businesses into Danaher. Settlement of Litigation During the third quarter of 2009, Ormco Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, settled certain litigation pending between Ormco and Align Technology, Inc. (Align). Among other provisions, as part of the settlement, Align paid $13 million in cash to Ormco and issued to the Company 7.6 million shares of Align common stock which, following issuance, represented an approximately ten percent ownership interest in Align. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $85 million ($53 million after tax or $0.16 per share) related to the settlement representing the cash received and the value of the shares received on the date the shares were issued to the Company, net of $13 million of related legal and direct settlement costs incurred. This gain is reflected as “other (income) expense” in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Restructuring Activities During 2009, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring and other related charges totaling $238.5 million. Of the total 2009 restructuring costs incurred, $192.3 million ($144.4 million net of tax or $0.43 per diluted share) was incurred pursuant to plans approved by the Company in April and August of 2009 and $46.2 million was incurred in connection with the Company’s normal on-going restructuring actions. The plans approved by the Company in April and August 2009 reflected management’s assessment that adjustments to the Company’s on-going cost structure were appropriate in light of lower demand in most of the Company’s end markets resulting from the overall deterioration in global economic conditions that began in the latter half of 2008 and continued through 2009. These 2009 restructuring actions include employee-related and facility shut-down costs of $228.1 million and non-cash asset write-offs of $10.4 million. Cash expenditures for these restructuring activities are being funded with cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2009, cash payments of $106.5 million related to these actions have been made. The Company’s 2009 restructuring activities generated approximately $50 million pre-tax savings during 2009 and the Company expects to realize approximately $170 million of incremental year-over-year pre-tax savings during 2010 associated with these restructuring activities. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring and other related charges totaling $82.0 million ($61.5 million net of tax, or $0.18 per diluted share) relating to restructuring actions designed to better position the Company’s cost base in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions. These charges included 30 Table of Contents cash employee-related and facility shut-down costs of $76 million and non-cash asset write-offs of $6 million. All required cash payments related to the actions have been made as of December 31, 2009. The 2008 restructuring activities generated approximately $100 million of pre-tax savings during 2009 and the Company expects comparable annual savings in future years. Refer to Note 17 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these restructuring activities. The impact of these restructuring costs on each of the Company’s reportable segments is discussed in the “–Results of Operations - Business Segments” below. Outlook While differences exist among the Company’s businesses, the year-over-year sales declines during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved compared to the year-over-year sales declines during each of the first three quarters of 2009, due in part to an improving global economic environment as well as easier year-over-year comparisons. The improved rates of decline were most evident in the product identification, test and measurement, dental and life sciences and diagnostics businesses. As economic conditions continue to stabilize, and providing no unforeseen, significant deterioration in general economic conditions occurs, the Company expects modest overall sales growth during 2010 as compared to 2009. The restructuring actions undertaken by the Company in 2008 and 2009 targeted at reducing the Company’s ongoing cost structure are expected to positively impact the Company’s earnings and operating cash flow in 2010 and future periods. The additional operating cash flow generated by these cost savings will continue to be strategically deployed to strengthen the Company’s competitive position and accelerate its sales and earnings potential. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased 12% compared to 2008. Sales from existing businesses declined 12% on a year-over-year basis. The impact of currency translation decreased reported sales by 2.0% as the U.S. dollar was, on average, stronger against other major currencies during 2009 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2008. Recently acquired businesses provided sales growth of approximately 2.0%. In this report, references to sales from existing businesses refers to sales calculated according to GAAP but excluding (1) sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition, and (2) the impact of currency translation. References to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or recently acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding acquisition sales) and (b) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding acquisition sales) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. Operating profit margins were 13.8% in the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 14.7% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in operating profit margins during 2009 is primarily a result of lower sales volumes in 2009 compared to 2008, as well as restructuring costs incurred during 2009 in excess of the level incurred during 2008 which reduced operating profit margin comparisons by 115 basis points on a year-over-year basis. In addition, the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses adversely impacted operating profit margin comparisons by 20 basis points. Cost savings realized in 2009 attributable to the Company’s 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses partially offset the reductions in operating profit margins. The gain recognized during 2009 in connection with the Align litigation settlement also favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 75 basis points. In addition, accounting charges recorded in 2008 associated with recording the fair value of inventory and deferred revenue acquired in connection with the November 2007 acquisition of Tektronix (net of comparable acquisition-related charges recorded in 2009) favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 10 basis points. The Company anticipates that the dilutive effect of acquisitions and acquisition-related accounting charges are factors that will continue to adversely impact operating profit margins in future periods, while the impact of the 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and the Company’s ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses are factors that will continue to benefit operating profit margins in future periods. 31 Table of Contents Business Segments The table below summarizes sales by business segment for each of the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Professional Instrumentation $ 4,330.7 $ 4,860.8 $ 3,537.9 Medical Technologies 3,141.9 3,277.0 2,998.0 Industrial Technologies 2,658.0 3,265.5 3,153.4 Tools & Components 1,054.3 1,294.2 1,336.6 Total $ 11,184.9 $ 12,697.5 $ 11,025.9 PROFESSIONAL INSTRUMENTATION Businesses in the Company’s Professional Instrumentation segment offer professional and technical customers various products and services that are used to enable or enhance the performance of their work. The Professional Instrumentation segment encompasses two strategic lines of business: environmental and test and measurement. These businesses produce and sell bench top and compact, professional electronic test tools and calibration equipment; a variety of video test and monitoring products, network management solutions, network diagnostic equipment and related services; water quality analytical instrumentation and consumables and ultraviolet disinfection systems; industrial water treatment solutions; and retail/commercial petroleum products and services, including dispensers, payment systems, underground storage tank leak detection and vapor recovery systems.

Price increases contributed 1.5% sales growth during 2009 and are reflected as a component of the changes in sales from existing businesses. Operating profit margins decreased 190 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in operating profit margins resulted primarily from lower sales volumes during 2009, as well as 145 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 compared to 2008. The dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses also adversely impacted operating profit margins on a year-over-year basis by 45 basis points. Accounting charges incurred in 2008 associated with recording the fair value of inventory and deferred revenue acquired in connection with the November 2007 acquisition of Tektronix (net of comparable acquisition-related charges recorded in 2009) favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 70 basis points. Cost savings realized in 2009 attributable to the Company’s 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses also partially offset the reductions in operating profit margins. Overview of Businesses within Professional Instrumentation Segment Environmental. Sales from the segment’s environmental businesses, representing 57% of segment sales for 2009, were essentially flat as compared to 2008. Sales from existing businesses decreased reported sales by 1.0% and the impact of currency translation decreased reported sales by 2.5%. Growth of 3.5% related to recently acquired businesses offset these sales declines. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s water quality businesses during 2009 were essentially flat as compared to 2008. A mid-teens growth rate in the business’ ultraviolet water treatment product line and a mid-single digit growth rate in the industrial water treatment product line offset low-single digit sales declines in the business’ laboratory and process instrumentation product line. Growth rates in the ultraviolet water treatment product line reflect strength in demand for municipal wastewater applications, as well as shipments related to a significant drinking water treatment plant project that commenced in 2009 and is expected to be substantially completed during 2010. In the business’ laboratory and process instrumentation product line and associated consumables, general economic conditions adversely impacted demand in all major geographies with the exception of China, where revenues grew at a low double-digit rate during 2009. Sales from existing businesses in the retail petroleum equipment business during 2009 declined at a low-single digit rate as compared to 2008. Strong North American sales of the business’ point-of-sale retail and payment solution product offerings that are being driven in part by regulatory requirements were more than offset by lower demand for dispensing equipment, primarily in Europe, and service offerings. Lower demand for the business’ automatic tank gauge product offerings and leak detection systems also adversely impacted year-over-year comparisons. The decline in demand for the business’ leak detection systems was partially attributable to a significant project in 2008 that did not repeat in 2009. Test & Measurement. Sales in the segment’s test and measurement businesses, representing 43% of segment sales for 2009, declined 22.0% as compared to 2008. Sales from existing businesses decreased reported sales by 24.0%, while the impact of currency translation decreased reported sales by 1.0%. Sales growth of 3.0% related to recently acquired businesses partially offset these declines. Soft demand across all instrumentation related product lines, attributable to general economic conditions and inventory reductions by distributors, drove sales declines during 2009. While year-over-year sales declined during each quarter during 2009, the rate of decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved compared to the first three quarters of the year primarily due to the adverse impact of inventory level reductions in the distribution channel that were largely completed by the end of the third quarter. Year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter were also favorably impacted by the decline in demand that commenced in the fourth quarter 2008 resulting in an easier comparison. Sales declined in all significant geographic regions. Year-over-year sales in the network and communication businesses declined at a lower rate than the instrumentation business primarily as a result of positive performance in the network management solutions businesses which benefited from the competition among mobile telecommunication providers to expand coverage, services and performance of their networks. 33 Table of Contents 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 Segment sales for Professional Instrumentation increased 37.5% for 2008 as compared to 2007. Sales growth was experienced in both of the segment’s strategic lines of business during the year, with the majority of the growth coming from acquisitions. Price increases accounted for approximately 2.0% sales growth which is reflected as a component of the sales from existing businesses. Fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the Professional Instrumentation segment by 60 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. In addition, the dilutive impact of recently acquired businesses reduced 2008 operating profit margins by 295 basis points, including the adverse impact of acquired inventory and acquired deferred revenue fair value charges recorded related to the acquisition of Tektronix. The Company also incurred Tektronix-related charges in 2007 associated with acquired in-process research and development that affected year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 170 basis points. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales increased during 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily as a result of the increase in amortization expense associated with the intangible assets acquired in connection with the Tektronix acquisition. Overview of Businesses within Professional Instrumentation Segment Environmental. Sales from the Company’s environmental businesses, representing approximately 51% of segment sales for 2008, increased 15.5% in 2008 compared to 2007. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 6.5% growth while acquisitions accounted for 7.5% growth and currency translation accounted for 1.5% growth. The segment’s water quality businesses experienced high-single digit revenue growth from existing businesses in 2008 as compared to 2007. This growth was primarily a result of strong laboratory and process sales, reflecting in part the results of increased sales force investments and penetration into emerging markets. Growth in sales was experienced in all major geographic regions with particular strength in Asia where sales increased at a double digit rate. Also contributing to the year-over-year growth was increased demand by municipalities for the businesses’ ultraviolet disinfection water treatment product offerings which experienced a mid-teens sales growth rate. The retail petroleum equipment business experienced mid-single digit revenue growth from existing businesses in 2008 as compared to 2007. This growth was primarily driven by strong sales of payment and point of sale retail and payment solution product offerings offset by a decline in dispensing equipment sales primarily in North America and Europe. An increase in demand for the business’ vapor recovery products in North America also contributed to the year-over-year sales growth, primarily related to an enhanced vapor recovery product that received regulatory approval and launched during the fourth quarter of 2008. Test and Measurement. Sales from the Company’s test and measurement businesses, representing approximately 49% of segment sales for 2008, grew 70% compared to 2007. Sales from existing businesses were essentially flat while acquisitions accounted for 68.0% growth and currency translation accounted for approximately 2.0% growth. Sales growth from existing businesses was driven primarily by performance during the first nine months of 2008 as a result of strong sales of the business’ thermography and precision measurement product offerings as well as strong growth from investments in emerging markets. While demand for the business’ thermography products continued to increase as compared to 2007 during the fourth quarter, demand slowed for the business’ traditional industrial digital hand-held instruments and precision measurement products resulting in a mid-single digit rate sales decline in the quarter and offsetting the growth experienced in the first nine months. In addition, the sales decline in the fourth quarter of 2008 is a result of reductions of inventory in the distribution channel as well as the impact of currency exchange rate volatility on customer demand in certain emerging markets. Sales also declined throughout 2008 in the business’ enterprise network performance management line of business as a result of generally lower telecommunications demand and slower information technology spending by customers. 34 Table of Contents MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES The Medical Technologies segment consists of businesses that offer clinical and research medical professionals various products and services that are used in connection with the performance of their work. The Medical Technologies segment encompasses the dental and life sciences and diagnostics businesses. Medical Technologies Selected Financial Data For the Years Ended December 31($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Sales $ 3,141.9 $ 3,277.0 $ 2,998.0 Operating Profit 395.5 370.5 393.2 Depreciation and amortization 127.8 123.5 119.7 Restructuring and other related charges 60.5 26.1 — Operating profit as a % of sales 12.6 % 11.3 % 13.1 % Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales 4.1 % 3.8 % 4.0 % Restructuring and other related charges as a % of sales 1.9 % 0.8 % — Components of Sales Growth (Decline) 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 Existing businesses (5.0 )% 4.5 % Acquisitions 3.5 % 2.0 % Currency exchange rates (2.5 )% 3.0 % Total (4.0 )% 9.5 % 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 During 2009, sales growth in the segment’s acute care diagnostic and pathology diagnostic businesses was more than offset by sales declines in the segment’s life sciences instrumentation and dental businesses. Price increases contributed 1.0% sales growth during 2009 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses. Operating profit margins increased 130 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008. The gain recognized during 2009 in connection with the Align litigation settlement favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 270 basis points. Restructuring costs incurred during 2009 in excess of the levels incurred during 2008 reduced operating profit margins by 105 basis points on a year-over-year basis and the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses adversely impacted operating profit margin comparisons by 15 basis points. The adoption of the new business combination accounting standard, requiring the expensing of transaction costs for pending and completed acquisitions after December 31, 2008, also reduced operating profit margins for 2009 by 55 basis points. While the year-over-year sales declines diminished leverage of the segment’s fixed cost base, the 2009 cost savings attributable to the Company’s 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses offset this adverse impact. Overview of Businesses within Medical Technologies Segment Sales in the segment’s existing acute care diagnostics business grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008. Continued strong aftermarket consumables sales related to the business’ installed base of acute care diagnostic instrumentation drove the majority of the growth during 2009. Increased sales of the business’ 35 Table of Contents cardiac marking instrument also contributed to the year-over-year growth and are expected to further benefit sales in 2010. Sales grew at a double-digit rate in China and the emerging economies of Latin America during 2009, while combined Europe and North America sales were flat. Sales in the segment’s existing life science instrumentation and pathology diagnostics businesses declined at a low-single digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008. Sales growth attributable to pathology diagnostic instrumentation and associated consumable products, primarily outside of North America, was more than offset by sales declines attributable to lower demand for compound and stereo microscopy equipment primarily in Europe and North America. Lower demand for microscopy equipment resulted largely from lower capital spending in the Company’s customer base throughout 2009. While year-over-year sales in the life sciences instrumentation business declined in each quarter during 2009, the rate of year-over-year decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved compared to the first three quarters of the year as economic stimulus funding, primarily in Japan, began to favorably impact the business. North American stimulus funding did not significantly benefit the business in 2009, but is expected to positively impact the Company’s results in 2010. Sales in the segment’s existing dental businesses declined at a high-single digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008. Sales in the dental consumables business during 2009 were essentially flat as compared to 2008. Increased sales of orthodontia and infection control products during 2009 were offset by weaker demand for implants, endodontic products and general dentistry consumables. Lower capital spending by customers and inventory reductions in certain distribution channels drove year-over-year sales declines at a mid-teen rate in the dental technologies businesses. While year-over-year sales in the dental technologies business declined in each quarter during 2009, the rate of year-over-year decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved compared to the first three quarters of the year due to strong sales of treatment units in Europe, as well as easier year-over-year comparisons due to a large stocking order for imaging equipment that occurred in the third quarter 2008. The Company’s acquisition of PaloDEx, a leading manufacturer of dental imaging products, in the fourth quarter of 2009 will provide additional sales growth in the Company’s dental imaging business in 2010. 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 Segment sales for Medical Technologies increased 9.5% for 2008 as compared to 2007. Sales growth was primarily driven by the segment’s acute care diagnostics, life sciences instrumentation and pathology diagnostics businesses. Price increases accounted for approximately 1.0% sales growth which is reflected as a component of the sales from existing businesses. The fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the Medical Technologies segment by 80 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. In addition, the dilutive impact of recently acquired businesses reduced 2008 operating profit margins by 40 basis points. A decline in demand for certain products in the dental technologies business, in addition to increased sales force investment and research and development costs within the life sciences business, also adversely impacted year-over-year operating margin profit comparisons. Overview of Businesses within Medical Technologies Segment Revenues in the segment’s acute care diagnostics business grew at mid-single digit rate in 2008 as compared to 2007. The year-over-year growth was primarily attributable to strong aftermarket consumables sales for the business’ installed base of acute care diagnostic instrumentation, sales of the business’ compact version of its blood gas analysis instrument as well as sales resulting from the launch of the business’ AQT cardiac marker during 2008. Sales growth was experienced in all major geographic regions during the year. Particularly strong growth in emerging markets during the first nine months of the year moderated during the fourth quarter as a result of currency exchange rate volatility and economic uncertainty. The segment’s life science instrumentation business experienced high-single digit revenue growth in 2008 as compared to 2007. Continued strong sales of the business’ pathology diagnostics instrumentation and consumables offerings as well as compound microscopy product offerings drove the majority of this growth. All major geographic regions experienced growth. 36 Table of Contents The segment’s dental business’ revenue in 2008 was essentially flat as compared to 2007. Revenues in the dental technologies business grew at a mid-single digit rate through the first nine months of 2008 primarily driven by strong demand for imaging equipment. However, a significant decline in demand in the fourth quarter for the majority of the products in the dental technologies’ business, including imaging equipment, more than offset this earlier growth resulting in low-single digit sales declines for the year. The decline in demand is primarily attributable to customer decisions to cancel or delay capital spending as well as inventory reductions in certain distribution channels. Offsetting the 2008 sales declines in the dental technologies business was low-single digit growth in the dental consumables business. Sales growth in the dental consumables’ businesses was primarily due to strong sales of general dentistry consumables and increased demand for endodontic and infection control products, offset by lower demand in the orthodontia product line. INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES Businesses in the Industrial Technologies segment manufacture products and sub-systems that are typically incorporated by customers and systems integrators into production and packaging lines, as well as incorporated by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) into various end-products. Many of the businesses also provide services to support their products, including helping customers integrate and install the products and helping ensure product uptime. The Industrial Technologies segment encompasses two strategic lines of business, product identification and motion, and two focused niche businesses, aerospace and defense, and sensors and controls. These businesses produce and sell product identification equipment and consumables; precision motion control equipment; monitoring, sensing and control devices; and aerospace safety devices and defense articles. In the third quarter of 2007, the Company disposed of the power quality businesses that were part of this segment and all 2007 segment results have been adjusted to exclude the results of these discontinued operations. Industrial Technologies Segment Selected Financial Data For the Years Ended December 31($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Sales $ 2,658.0 $ 3,265.5 $ 3,153.4 Operating profit 383.2 522.1 532.5 Depreciation and amortization 56.0 64.4 63.2 Restructuring and other related charges 60.7 23.1 — Operating profit as a % of sales 14.4 % 16.0 % 16.9 % Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales 2.1 % 2.0 % 2.0 % Restructuring and other related charges as a % of sales 2.3 % 0.7 % — Components of Sales Growth (Decline) 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 Existing businesses (16.0 )% 1.5 % Acquisitions 0.5 % — Currency exchange rates (3.0 )% 2.0 % Total (18.5 )% 3.5 % 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 Sales declines in a majority of the segment’s businesses during 2009 more than offset sales growth of approximately 1.5% related to price increases which are reflected as a component of the decrease in sales from existing businesses. 37 Table of Contents Operating profit margins in the segment declined 160 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in operating profit margins resulted primarily from lower sales volumes during 2009, as well as 75 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 compared to 2008. The adoption of the new business combination accounting standard, requiring the expensing of transaction costs for pending and completed acquisitions after December 31, 2008, combined with the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses, also reduced operating profit margins for 2009 by 10 basis points. Cost savings realized in 2009 attributable to the Company’s 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses partially offset these negative factors. Overview of Businesses within Industrial Technologies Segment Product Identification. Sales from the segment’s product identification businesses, representing approximately 29% of segment sales during 2009, declined 10.5% as compared to 2008. Sales from existing businesses decreased reported sales by 8.0%, while the impact of currency translation decreased reported sales by 4.0%. Sales growth of 1.5% related to recently acquired businesses partially offset these declines. Sales declines from existing businesses during 2009 resulted primarily from weak demand for core marking and coding equipment due to lower capital spending by customers as a result of general economic conditions. Sales of consumable products associated with the businesses’ installed base of marking and coding equipment also declined on a year-over-year basis but not as significantly as equipment sales. During the fourth quarter of 2009, equipment sales increased on a year-over-year basis primarily due to emerging market growth. Flat consumable product sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 were an improvement to year-over-year consumable sales declines during the first three quarters of the year. Sales in the China market grew during the second half of 2009, resulting in low-single digit sales growth for the full year. Continued capital project freezes by the United States Postal Service contributed to year-over-year sales declines in the business’ integrated scanning system product line. Motion. Sales from the segment’s motion businesses, representing approximately 27% of segment sales during 2009, declined 33.5% as compared to 2008. Sales from existing businesses decreased reported sales by 30.0%, while the impact of currency translation decreased reported sales by 3.5%. Sales from existing businesses declined as a result of weak demand for most of the businesses’ product offerings attributable to the recessionary economic conditions that existed throughout 2009. While year-over-year sales in the motion businesses declined in each quarter during 2009, the rate of year-over-year decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved slightly compared to the second and third quarters of the year, due to improvements in demand for certain product offerings and the absence of inventory reductions experienced in early 2009 in the business’ distribution channels. Focused Niche Businesses. Sales in the segment’s niche businesses declined at a low-double digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008. The Company’s sensors and controls business saw modest improvement in certain end markets during the fourth quarter 2009 as compared to the first nine months of 2009. Demand in the Company’s aerospace and defense businesses softened in the second half of 2009, however, primarily due to declines in demand in the commercial aviation end markets. 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 Segment sales for Industrial Technologies increased 3.5% for 2008 as compared to 2007. Sales growth experienced for the majority of the year in the segment’s motion and niche aerospace and defense and sensors lines of business was partially offset by sales declines experienced in the segment’s product identification line of business, primarily in the second half of 2008. Price increases accounted for approximately 2.0% sales growth which is reflected as a component of the sales from existing businesses. The fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the Industrial Technologies segment by 70 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. In addition, gains recorded in 2007 due to the collection of indemnification proceeds related to a lawsuit and from the sale of real estate adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 45 basis points. Operating profit margin improvements during 2008, primarily relating to cost savings initiatives implemented beginning in late 2007, partially offset these adverse impacts. 38 Table of Contents Overview of Businesses within Industrial Technologies Segment Product Identification. The product identification businesses accounted for approximately 27% of segment sales in 2008. Sales from the segment’s product identification businesses decreased 1.5% in 2008 compared to 2007. Sales from existing businesses accounted for a 3.5% decline in sales while currency translation contributed 1.5% to revenue growth and acquisitions contributed 0.5% to revenue growth in 2008. Through the first nine months of 2008, sales growth driven by increased demand for both consumable products and services associated with the installed base of marking and coding equipment had partially offset a decline in equipment sales. Further weakening of equipment demand during the fourth quarter, primarily in North America and Europe, resulted in double-digit year-over-year declines in equipment sales during the quarter as customers cancelled or delayed purchases. The declines in equipment sales more than offset the sales growth from consumables and services experienced throughout the majority of 2008. In addition, sales in the integrated scanning system product line declined throughout 2008 due to lower capital expenditures by the United States Postal Service and the timing of completion of various large projects for other large parcel post and retail customers. Motion Sales in the segment’s motion businesses, representing approximately 34% of segment sales in 2008, increased 4.0% over 2007. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 1.0% growth while currency translation accounted for 3.0% growth during 2008. There were no acquisitions in the motion businesses in 2008 or 2007. Sales growth from existing businesses during 2008 was primarily driven by demand for custom motors and drives, particularly in the elevator application, flat panel display and aerospace and defense end markets. Largely offsetting this growth was weakness in demand for the business’ standard motors and drives product offerings throughout the year, and in particular during the fourth quarter, primarily in North America and Europe. In addition, during the fourth quarter, demand for products supporting the semiconductor and electronic assembly end markets, as well as other industrial applications, declined at levels in excess of the declines experienced during the first nine months of the year. Focused Niche Businesses. Revenues in the segment’s existing niche businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2008 as compared to 2007, driven primarily by high-single digit sales growth in the segment’s aerospace and defense businesses and low-single digit sales growth in the segment’s sensors and controls businesses. Sales growth from the sensors and controls business primarily occurred during the first nine months of 2008 as demand weakened during the fourth quarter resulting in essentially flat segment sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the comparable period of 2007. TOOLS & COMPONENTS The Tools & Components segment is one of the largest producers and distributors of general purpose and specialty mechanics’ hand tools. Other products manufactured by the businesses in this segment include toolboxes and storage devices; diesel engine retarders; wheel service equipment and drill chucks. 39 Table of Contents Tools & Components Selected Financial Data For the Years Ended December 31($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Sales $ 1,054.3 $ 1,294.2 $ 1,336.6 Operating profit 124.8 157.7 175.6 Depreciation and amortization 21.0 21.0 20.8 Restructuring and other related charges 18.3 4.0 — Operating profit as a % of sales 11.8 % 12.2 % 13.1 % Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales 2.0 % 1.6 % 1.6 % Restructuring and other related charges as a % of sales 1.7 % 0.3 % — Components of Sales Growth (Decline) 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 Existing businesses (18.0 )% (3.5 )% Acquisition / Product line divestiture — — Currency exchange rates (0.5 )% 0.5 % Total (18.5 )% (3.0 )% 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 Sales declined in both the mechanics’ hand tools business and the segment’s niche businesses during 2009 as compared to 2008. Price increases did not appreciably impact segment results during 2009. Operating profit margins in the segment were 40 basis points lower during 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in operating profit margins resulted primarily from 130 basis points of incremental year-over-year restructuring costs incurred during 2009 compared to 2008. In addition, a gain recorded in 2008 from the settlement of an insurance claim related to a 2007 plant fire adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. Lower year-over-year average commodity costs, cost savings attributable to the Company’s 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and improved productivity in the business’ manufacturing facilities partially offset these negative year-over-year factors. Overview of Businesses within the Tools & Components Segment Mechanics’ hand tools sales from existing businesses, representing approximately 75% of segment sales, declined 11% during 2009 as compared to 2008. The year-over-year decline in sales is primarily a result of generally weak North American demand in the retail, industrial and mobile tool markets relating to general economic conditions. Modest growth in the China domestic market during 2009 partially offset weak North American demand. Sales in the segment’s niche businesses declined approximately 35% during 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to weak end market demand. While demand was weak throughout 2009, the rate of sales decline during the second half of 2009 was not as pronounced as the rate of sales decline in the first half of 2009, in part because of easier year-over-year comparisons as these businesses began experiencing revenue declines in mid-2008. 40 Table of Contents 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 Price increases accounted for approximately 2.0% sales growth on a year-over-year basis which is reflected as a component of the sales from existing businesses. The fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the Tools and Components segment by 30 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. Elevated commodity costs and lower overall sales volumes in the mechanics’ hand tools business also adversely impacted operating profit margins. A 2008 gain from the settlement of an insurance claim related to a 2007 plant fire, coupled with the impact of charges recorded in 2007 associated with the fire, favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 50 basis points. Commodity costs declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008. Overview of Businesses within the Tools & Components Segment Mechanics’ hand tools sales, representing approximately 69% of segment sales in 2008, declined 5.5% in 2008 compared to 2007. Sales from existing businesses declined 6.0% during 2008, offset by a 0.5% positive impact as a result of foreign currency translation. The sales decline is primarily attributable to weak North American demand in both the retail, mobile and industrial hand tools end markets. Partially offsetting the weak North American demand was sales growth in the Asian market, primarily in the first half of 2008, as the rate of growth in the region slowed during the second half of the year. The segment’s niche businesses experienced a modest sales increase during 2008 as compared to 2007. Higher customer demand in the segment’s engine retarder business, which rebounded from the impact of regulatory changes that resulted in reduced 2007 sales levels, were largely offset by lower demand in the segment’s other niche businesses during year, with particularly lower demand in the fourth quarter. GROSS PROFIT For the Years Ended December 31($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Sales $ 11,184.9 $ 12,697.5 $ 11,025.9 Cost of sales 5,904.7 6,757.3 5,985.0 Gross profit 5,280.2 5,940.2 5,040.9 Gross profit margin 47.2 % 46.8 % 45.7 % Gross profit margins for 2009 increased 40 basis points from 2008. Cost savings related to 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities primarily drove the year-over-year improvements in gross profit margin from 2008 to 2009. Lower year-over-year commodity costs also contributed to the improvement, as costs for several types of raw materials increased sharply in 2008 before declining late in 2008 and into 2009. Lower overall sales volumes during 2009 as compared to 2008 diminished the leverage of the Company’s fixed cost base and partially offset these positive factors. In addition, costs incurred associated with year-over-year incremental 2009 restructuring activities adversely impacted gross profit margins by 65 basis points. Gross profit margins for 2008 increased 110 basis points from 2007. Included in the 2008 gross profit margins is $33 million (25 basis points) of restructuring and other related costs. The increase in gross profit margins over 2007 is primarily a result of leverage on increased sales volume, particularly in higher-margin consumable oriented businesses, the impact of cost-saving initiatives that began in late 2007 and generally higher gross profit margins in businesses recently acquired, primarily Tektronix. The impact on gross margins of higher commodity costs prevalent through the majority of 2008 was partially mitigated by price increases implemented throughout the Company. 41 Table of Contents OPERATING EXPENSES For the Years Ended December 31($ in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Sales $ 11,184.9 $ 12,697.5 $ 11,025.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 3,190.2 3,345.3 2,713.1 Research and development expenses 632.7 725.4 601.4 SG&A as a % of sales 28.5 % 26.3 % 24.6 % R&D as a % of sales 5.7 % 5.7 % 5.5 % The year-over-year increases in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales from 2008 to 2009 is primarily due to reduced leverage of the Company’s cost base caused by lower sales volumes during 2009 as compared to 2008. Incremental year-over-year costs associated with 2009 restructuring activities adversely impacted selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales by 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis, although the 2008 and 2009 restructuring actions have generated year-over-year cost savings that partially offset these negative factors. Research and development expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) as a percentage of sales were flat during 2009 as compared to 2008. The Company continues to invest in new product development within all of its businesses, with particular emphasis on the medical technologies, test and measurement, environmental and product identification businesses. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for 2008 increased 170 basis points from 2007. Included in the 2008 selling, general and administrative expenses is $49 million (40 basis points) of restructuring and other related costs. Other increases in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales are primarily associated with recently acquired businesses and their higher relative operating expense structures. Increased spending to fund growth opportunities throughout the Company, particularly in emerging markets, also contributed to the growth as a percentage of sales. Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales were approximately 20 basis points higher in 2008 as compared to 2007. The 2007 charge for acquired in-process research and development related to the Tektronix acquisition, as described below, impacted year-over-year comparisons by 75 basis points. The relatively higher research and development cost structures of recently acquired businesses, primarily Tektronix, and higher investment in research and development in the Medical Technologies segment were the primary drivers of these year-over-year increases. INTEREST EXPENSE AND INCOME For a description of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness, please refer to “–Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities and Indebtedness” below. Interest expense of $123 million in 2009 was $7.5 million lower than 2008 primarily as a result of lower average debt levels during 2009 as the Company deployed cash flows to repay a portion of its commercial paper borrowings. Interest attributable to the $750 million principal amount of 5.40% senior unsecured notes issued in March 2009 (as discussed below) partially offset the positive impact of the reduction in outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Interest expense of $130 million in 2008 was approximately $20 million higher than 2007 as a result of higher average debt levels during 2008, primarily as a result of borrowings incurred in the fourth quarter 2007 to fund the acquisition of Tektronix. The Company recognized interest income of $5 million, $10 million and $6 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Interest income in 2009 was lower than interest income in 2008 as the lower interest rates on deposits 42 Table of Contents in 2009 compared to 2008 more than offset higher average invested cash balances. Interest income during 2008 was higher than during 2007 as a result of higher average invested cash balances as less cash was deployed for acquisitions during 2008. INCOME TAXES General Income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the Company’s financial statements. The Company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur. The Company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as discussed below), the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in tax laws. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2009 differs from the United States federal statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of lower effective tax rates on certain earnings from operations outside of the United States. No provisions for United States income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States. The amount of United States income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the Company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings. As of December 31, 2009, the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately $6.5 billion. The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for contingent tax liabilities. Based on these reviews, the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the closure of tax years subject to tax audit, reserves are adjusted as necessary. For a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors”. Year-Over-Year Changes in Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate The Company’s effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was 19.2%, 24.7% and 25.8%, respectively. The Company’s 2009 effective tax rate of 19.2% includes the impact of approximately $97.2 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, related to gains from the net reduction of reserves associated with the resolution of uncertain tax positions and discrete items. The impact of expensing transaction costs in accordance with the new business combination accounting standard, much of which are not deductible for income tax purposes, partially offset these beneficial factors. The Company’s 2008 effective tax rate of 24.7% includes the impact of approximately $9.5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, related to gains from the net reduction of reserves associated with uncertain tax positions and discrete items recorded primarily during the second quarter. The effective tax rate also reflects the impact of the continued growth in earnings outside of the United States. Refer to Note 14 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The effective tax rate for 2010 is expected to be approximately 25%. 43 Table of Contents INFLATION The effect of broad based inflation on the Company’s operations was not significant in the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, 2008 or 2007. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk, which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. In addition, the Company’s broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole. Interest Rate Risk A change in interest rates on long-term debt is assumed to impact the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt but not our earnings or cash flow because the interest on the Company’s long-term debt is fixed. As of December 31, 2009, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt (excluding the LYONs which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from its underlying common stock) by approximately $120 million. However, since the Company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturity, the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the Company’s long-term debt does not affect the Company’s results of operations or stockholders’ equity. A change in interest rates on short-term debt impacts our earnings and cash flow, but not the fair value of the Company’s short-term debt instruments because of their limited duration. As of December 31, 2009, the Company’s short-term debt obligations relate primarily to U.S. dollar commercial paper borrowings, and as a result its primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2009. As these obligations mature, the Company anticipates issuing additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. In 2009, a 50% increase in average market interest rates on the Company’s commercial paper borrowings would have increased the Company’s interest expense by approximately $0.4 million. A 50% hypothetical fluctuation is used as the Company’s actual commercial paper interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2009. Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the Company’s net investment in international subsidiaries, net of the translation effect of the Eurobonds, is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive income” component of stockholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in major currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2009 (net of the translation effect of the Company’s Eurobond Notes, as described below) would result in a reduction of stockholders’ equity of approximately $500 million. The Company also faces exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States. Although the Company has a U.S. dollar functional currency for reporting purposes, it has manufacturing sites throughout the world and a substantial portion of its costs are incurred, and sales are generated in foreign currencies. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the United States dollar. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. 44 Table of Contents On average, the U.S. dollar strengthened against other major currencies during 2009. As a result, currency exchange rates decreased reported sales for 2009 by approximately 2.0% as compared to reported sales for 2008. The impact of currency exchange rates on reported sales on a year-over-year basis was more significant in the first half of 2009 as the U.S. dollar weakened against other major currencies during the second half of 2009 and ended the year at exchange rates lower than existed as of December 31, 2008. If the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2009 prevail throughout 2010, currency exchange rates will positively impact 2010 reported sales and operating results relative to the Company’s performance in 2009. Additional weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would have a further positive impact on the Company’s reported sales and results of operations. Any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would adversely impact the Company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Therefore, both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales, profit, and assets and liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Eurobond Notes described below (which as of December 31, 2009 had outstanding borrowings in principal amount equivalent to $716 million) provide a natural hedge to a portion of the Company’s European net asset position. Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, and trade accounts receivable. The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to its financial instruments. The Company places cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world, and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents. Our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds. In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to the diversity of the Company’s customers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial conditions and obtains collateral or other security when appropriate. 45 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Management assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. The Company’s ability to access the commercial paper market and the other capital markets has not been affected adversely by the recent uncertainty in the financial markets. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its cash flow and other sources of liquidity, primarily its commercial paper program and committed credit facility, will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions and maintain its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. For a discussion of risks related to the uncertainty in the financial markets and the global economy in general, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity ($ in millions) For the Years Ended December 31 2009 2008 2007 Operating cash flows from continuing operations $ 1,800.8 $ 1,859.0 $ 1,699.3 Operating cash flows used by discontinued operations — — (53.5 ) Net cash flows from operating activities 1,800.8 1,859.0 1,645.8 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (188.5 ) (193.8 ) (162.1 ) Cash paid for acquisitions (703.5 ) (423.2 ) (3,576.6 ) Cash paid for investment in acquisition targets and other marketable securities (66.8 ) — (23.2 ) Other sources 15.9 49.6 316.8 Investing cash flows from continued operations (942.9 ) (567.4 ) (3,445.1 ) Investing cash flows from discontinued operations — — (0.7 ) Net cash used in investing activities (942.9 ) (567.4 ) (3,445.8 ) Proceeds from the issuance of common stock 174.2 82.4 733.0 Debt (repayments) proceeds, net of new borrowings (excluding March 2009 public debt offering) (469.9 ) (1,092.3 ) 1,131.0 Proceeds of March 2009 public debt offering 744.6 — — Purchase of treasury stock — (74.2 ) (117.5 ) Payment of dividends (41.7 ) (38.2 ) (34.3 ) Net cash provided by / (used in) financing activities 407.2 (1,122.3 ) 1,712.2 • Operating cash flow from continuing operations, a key source of the Company’s liquidity, decreased $58 million during 2009, or approximately 3%, as compared to 2008. • Funding for acquisitions constituted the most significant use of cash during 2009. The Company acquired fifteen businesses during 2009. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was approximately $704 million in cash, net of cash acquired. In addition, the Company used approximately $67 million in cash for other investment opportunities. • The Company repaid approximately $470 million of debt (net of new borrowings, other than the proceeds from the March 2009 public debt offering) during 2009. 46 Table of Contents • The Company’s restructuring activities used approximately $190 million in cash during 2009. • In March 2009, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due 2019. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, were approximately $745 million. A portion of the net proceeds was used to repay a portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial paper and the balance of the net proceeds is being used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. • As of December 31, 2009, the Company held $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents. As discussed below in “–Recent Acquisition Activity,” subsequent to December 31, 2009, the Company utilized $1.1 billion of cash on hand in connection with the completion of the AB Sciex and Molecular Devices acquisitions. Operating Activities The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position, with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for items such as income taxes, restructuring activities, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was approximately $1.8 billion for 2009, a decrease of $58 million, or approximately 3% as compared to 2008. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily attributable to the decrease in earnings in 2009 as compared to 2008 and to a lesser extent attributable to the year-over-year incremental amount of cash paid related to the Company’s restructuring activities. In addition, the Company voluntarily contributed $60 million to the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2009 while it made no contribution in 2008. The declines in operating cash flow were partially offset by improvements in operating working capital (defined by the Company as trade accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable) which contributed $228 million of cash flow during 2009 as compared to contributing $108 million of cash flow during 2008. Operating working capital in 2009 benefited from increased collections of accounts receivable and reduced inventory levels associated with lower levels of business activity, partially offset by reductions in accounts payable as compared to 2008. A decline of approximately $100 million in tax payments during 2009 as compared to 2008 also partially offset the decline in operating cash flow. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was approximately $1.9 billion for 2008, an increase of $160 million, or approximately 9.5% as compared to 2007. Earnings growth of $104 million in addition to an increase of approximately $39 million in contributions from operating working capital as compared to 2007 contributed to the overall year-over-year increase in operating cash flows. The 2008 operating working capital contribution increased primarily due to strong collections of accounts receivable. Operating cash flows during 2008 also benefited approximately $83 million from year-over-year increases in stock compensation, depreciation and amortization charges which did not require the use of cash. In addition, non-cash acquisition related charges incurred related to acquired inventory and acquired deferred revenue in connection with the 2007 acquisition of Tektronix had a positive impact on operating cash flow comparisons. Approximately $100 million of additional income tax payments made in 2008 related to continuing operations as compared to 2007 partially offset these positive factors. In connection with the Company’s restructuring activities, the Company records appropriate accruals for the costs of closing facilities, severing personnel and, in connection with acquisitions, integrating the acquired businesses into existing Company operations. Cash flows from operating activities are reduced by the amounts expended against the various accruals. During 2009, the Company paid approximately $161 million related to its 2009 and 2008 restructuring activities and approximately $28 million related to restructuring activities associated with acquisitions completed prior to December 31, 2008. Please refer to Note 2 and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about these expenditures. 47 Table of Contents Investing Activities Cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures and cash flows from divestitures of businesses or assets. Net cash used in investing activities was $943 million during 2009 compared to $567 million of net cash used in 2008. Gross capital spending of $189 million during 2009 was approximately $5 million less than gross capital spending during 2008. Capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development and improving information technology systems. In 2010, the Company expects capital spending to approximate $225 million, though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions. Net cash used in investing activities related to continuing operations was approximately $567 million in 2008 compared to approximately $3.4 billion in 2007. Gross capital spending increased $32 million in 2008 from 2007 levels to $194 million. As discussed below, the Company completed numerous business acquisitions and divestitures during 2009, 2008 and 2007. All of the acquisitions during this period have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Company’s financial statements. This goodwill typically arises because the purchase prices for these businesses reflect a number of factors including the future earnings and cash flow potential of these businesses; the multiple to earnings, cash flow and other factors at which similar businesses have been purchased by other acquirers; the competitive nature of the process by which the Company acquired the business; and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these businesses bring to existing operations. For a discussion of other factors resulting in the recognition of goodwill see Notes 2 and 6 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 2009 Acquisitions/Divestitures The Company acquired fifteen businesses during 2009 for consideration of approximately $704 million in cash, net of cash acquired. Each company acquired manufactures products and/or provides services in the life sciences, dental, product identification, environmental or test and measurement markets. These businesses were acquired to complement existing units of the Medical Technologies, Professional Instrumentation and Industrial Technologies segments. The aggregate annual sales of these fifteen acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $430 million. In addition, during 2009 the Company divested five businesses or product lines for approximately $10 million of net cash proceeds. The divested businesses were part of the Industrial Technologies and Tools and Components segments and had aggregate annual revenues of approximately $53 million in 2009. The Company recorded no significant gain or loss, either individually or in the aggregate, associated with these divestitures. The Company is using the proceeds from these sales for general corporate purposes. 2008 Acquisitions The Company acquired seventeen companies or product lines during 2008 for consideration of approximately $423 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired and $8 million of debt assumed. Each company acquired manufactures products and/or provides services in the life sciences, dental, product identification, environmental or test and measurement markets. These companies were acquired to complement existing units of the Medical Technologies, Industrial Technologies or Professional Instrumentation segments. The aggregate annual sales of these seventeen acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $325 million. 2007 Acquisitions/Divestitures In November 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Tektronix, Inc. for total cash consideration of approximately $2.8 billion, including transaction costs and net of cash and debt acquired. The Company initially financed the acquisition of Tektronix through the issuance of commercial paper and available cash (including proceeds from the underwritten public offering of 6.9 million shares of Danaher common stock completed on 48 Table of Contents November 2, 2007). Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company issued $500 million of 5.625% senior notes due 2018 in an underwritten public offering and used the net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance the Tektronix acquisition. Tektronix had revenues of approximately $1.1 billion in its most recent completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition. In July 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of ChemTreat for a cash purchase price of $425 million including transaction costs. No cash was acquired in the transaction. The Company financed the acquisition primarily with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and to a lesser extent from available cash. ChemTreat had revenues of approximately $200 million in its most recent completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition. In addition, the Company acquired ten other companies or product lines during 2007 for consideration of approximately $273 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired, and $4 million of debt assumed. Each company acquired manufactures products and/or provides services in the test and measurement, dental technologies, product identification, sensors and controls or environmental instruments markets. These companies were all acquired to complement existing units of the Professional Instrumentation, Medical Technologies or Industrial Technologies segments. The aggregate annual sales of these ten acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $123 million. In addition to the twelve 2007 acquisitions noted above, during the first quarter of 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining shares of Vision Systems Limited not owned by the Company as of December 31, 2006 for cash consideration of approximately $96 million. In July 2007, the Company completed the sale of its power quality business generating approximately $275 million of net cash proceeds. This business, which was part of the Industrial Technologies segment and designs and manufactures power quality and reliability products and services, had aggregate annual revenues of approximately $130 million in 2006. The Company used the proceeds from this sale for general corporate purposes, including debt reduction and acquisitions. Recent Acquisition Developments Subsequent to December 31, 2009, the Company completed the previously announced acquisition of the Analytical Technologies division of MDS, which includes a 50% ownership position in Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex joint venture (“AB SCIEX”), a mass spectrometry business, and a 100% ownership position in the former Molecular Devices Corporation, a bioresearch and analytical instrumentation company. In a separate, but related transaction, the Company simultaneously completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership position in AB SCIEX from Life Technologies Corporation. The aggregate purchase price for the combined transactions was approximately $1.1 billion, including debt assumed and net of cash acquired. The Company funded the purchase price for this transaction from available cash on hand. Financing Activities and Indebtedness Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper, common stock and notes, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, repayments of indebtedness, repurchases of common stock and payments of dividends to shareholders. Financing activities provided cash of $404 million during 2009 compared to $1.1 billion of cash used during 2008. The year-over-year change was primarily due to the proceeds from the issuance of the 2019 Notes (described below); lower repayments of borrowings during 2009 as compared to 2008; and the repurchase of shares of Danaher common stock pursuant to the Company’s stock repurchase program during 2008. Total debt was $2.9 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2008. The Company’s debt as of December 31, 2009 was as follows: • $180 million of outstanding U.S. dollar denominated commercial paper; 49 Table of Contents • $716 million (€500 million) aggregate principal amount of 4.5% guaranteed Eurobond Notes due 2013 (“Eurobond Notes”); • $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2018 (“2018 Notes”); • $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.4% Senior Notes due 2019 (“2019 Notes”); • $634 million of zero coupon Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2021 (“LYONs”); and • $153 million of other borrowings. For a discussion of the Company’s debt as of December 31, 2009, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt, except in connection with the change of control provisions described as follows. Under each of the Eurobond Notes, the 2018 Notes and the 2019 Notes, if the Company experiences a change of control and a rating downgrade of a specified nature within a specified period following the change of control, the Company will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of the 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes, or the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of Eurobond Notes. The Company’s outstanding indentures and comparable instruments also contain customary covenants including, for example, limits on the incurrence of secured debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to the Company’s operations and as of December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants. For a discussion of the risks related to our indebtedness, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Commercial Paper Program and Credit Facility The Company satisfies its short-term liquidity needs primarily through issuances of U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper. Under the Company’s U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper programs, the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes in aggregate principal amount not to exceed $4.0 billion. Since the Credit Facilities (described below) provide credit support for the program, the $1.525 billion of availability under the Credit Facilities has the practical effect of reducing from $4.0 billion to $1.525 billion the maximum amount of commercial paper that the Company can issue under the program. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 90 days from the date of issuance. Borrowings under the program are available for general corporate purposes, including financing acquisitions. The Company classifies the borrowings under the commercial paper program as long-term borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company has the intent and the ability, as supported by the availability of the Credit Facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date. Credit support for part of the commercial paper program is provided by an unsecured $1.45 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) that expires on April 25, 2012 and an unsecured $75 million multicurrency revolving credit facility that expires on May 3, 2010 (the “Supplemental Credit Facility” and together with the Credit Facility, the “Credit Facilities”). The Credit Facilities can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Under the Credit Facility, interest is based on, at the Company’s option (1) a LIBOR-based formula that is dependent in part on the Company’s credit rating, (2) a formula based on the higher (as of the date of determination) of Bank of America’s prime rate or the Federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, or (3) the rate of interest bid by a particular lender for a particular loan under the facility. Under the Supplemental Credit Facility, interest is based on, at the Company’s option (1) a LIBOR-based formula, or (2) a formula based on the highest (as of the date of determination) of the lender’s prime rate, the Federal funds rate plus 50 basis points or the LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points. Both of the Credit Facilities require the Company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus stockholders’ equity) as of the last day of each quarter of 0.65 to 1.00 or less. As of December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with this covenant. The availability of the Credit Facilities as standby liquidity facilities to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of our commercial paper program. We expect to limit any borrowings under the Credit Facilities to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facilities so that we could borrow, if needed, to repay all of our outstanding commercial paper as it matures. The Company anticipates seeking a renewal of the term of the Supplemental Credit Facility from the lender prior to its scheduled expiration. 50 Table of Contents During 2009, the Company refinanced balances under its commercial paper program as they came due to maintain an outstanding balance throughout the year. During 2008, the Company utilized its commercial paper program to finance the repayment of the Company’s 6.1% notes that matured in October 2008. Amounts outstanding under the Company’s U.S. dollar commercial paper program as of December 31, 2009 had a weighted average interest rate of 0.2% and an average maturity of approximately 5 days. Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related costs of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Any downgrade in the Company’s credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the Company’s commercial paper program and Credit Facility, and could limit or preclude the Company’s ability to issue commercial paper. If our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, we would expect to rely on a combination of available operating cash flow and our Credit Facilities to provide short-term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under our Credit Facilities could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings. Other Long-Term Indebtedness In March 2009, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due 2019. The notes were issued at 99.93% of their principal amount. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, were approximately $745 million. A portion of the net proceeds were used to repay a portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial paper with the balance of the net proceeds used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The Company may redeem the notes at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest plus 40 basis points. In December 2007, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2018. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, were approximately $493.4 million, which were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance the acquisition of Tektronix. The Company may redeem the notes at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest plus 25 basis points. On July 21, 2006, a financing subsidiary of the Company issued the Eurobond Notes in a private placement outside the U.S. Payment obligations under these Eurobond Notes are guaranteed by the Company. The net proceeds of the offering, after the deduction of underwriting commissions but prior to the deduction of other issuance costs, were €496 million ($627 million based on exchange rates in effect at the time the offering closed) and were used to pay down a portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The Company may redeem the notes upon the occurrence of specified, adverse changes in tax laws, or interpretations under such laws, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed. In 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in LYONs. The net proceeds to the Company were $505 million, of which approximately $100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The LYONs carry a yield to maturity of 2.375% (with contingent interest payable as described below). Holders of the LYONs may convert each $1,000 of principal amount at maturity into 14.5352 shares of Danaher common stock (in the aggregate for all LYONs, approximately 12.0 million shares of Danaher common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January 22, 2021. As of December 31, 2009, an aggregate of approximately 68,000 shares of Danaher common stock had been issued upon conversion of LYONs. As of December 31, 2009, the accreted value of the outstanding LYONs was lower than the traded market value of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time at scheduled redemption prices. Holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash and/or Company common stock, at the Company’s option, on January 22, 2011. The holders had a similar option to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes as of January 22, 2004, which resulted in notes with an accreted value of $1.1 million being redeemed by the Company for cash. Under the terms of the LYONs, the Company will pay contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six month period from January 23 to July 22 and from July 23 to January 22 if the average market price of a LYON for a 51 Table of Contents specified measurement period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. The amount of contingent interest to be paid with respect to any quarterly period is equal to the higher of either 0.0315% of the bonds’ average market price during the specified measurement period or the amount of the common stock dividend paid during such quarterly period multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon conversion of a LYON. The Company paid approximately $1.1 million of contingent interest on the LYONs for the year ended December 31, 2009. Except for the contingent interest described above, the Company will not pay interest on the LYONs prior to maturity. Shelf Registration Statement The Company has a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance. Stock Repurchase Program On April 21, 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of the Company’s common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. There is no expiration date for the Company’s repurchase program. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by the Company’s management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Company’s equity compensation plans (including any successor plans) and for other corporate purposes. The Company did not repurchase any shares of Company common stock during 2009. During 2008, the Company repurchased 1.38 million shares of Company common stock in open market transactions at a cost of $74 million. During 2007, the Company repurchased 1.64 million of shares of the Company common stock in open market transactions at a cost of $117 million. The 2008 and 2007 repurchases were funded from available cash and from proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. At December 31, 2009, the Company had 1,977,566 shares remaining for stock repurchases under the existing Board authorization. The Company expects to fund any further repurchases using the Company’s available cash balances or proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. Dividends During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company increased its regular quarterly dividend from $0.03 to $0.04 by declaring a dividend of $0.04 per share that was paid on January 26, 2010 to holders of record on December 31, 2009. Aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2009 were approximately $42 million. Cash and Cash Requirements The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures and acquisitions, to pay interest and service debt, fund its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, pay dividends to shareholders and repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements and may borrow under existing commercial paper programs or the Credit Facilities or, subject to availability, access the capital markets as needed for liquidity. As of December 31, 2009, the Company held $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an average weighted annual interest rate of 0.4%. Of this amount, approximately $1.5 billion was held outside the United States. The Company’s cash balances are generated and held in numerous locations throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside the United States. The Company utilizes a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that its worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. Wherever possible, cash management is centralized and intra-company financing is used to provide working capital to the Company’s operations. Most of the cash balances held outside the United States could be repatriated to the United States, but, under current law, would potentially be subject to United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. 52 Table of Contents The provisions of the U.S. Pension Protection Act of 2006, enacted in August 2006 changed the minimum funding requirements for the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan beginning in 2009. During 2009, the Company voluntarily contributed $60 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan and approximately $34 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2010, the Company’s cash contribution requirements are expected to be approximately $24 million for its U.S. plan, however, the ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, underlying asset returns. The Company expects to contribute approximately $34 million in employer contributions and unfunded benefit payments to the non-U.S. plans in 2010. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009 under (1) long-term debt obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company’s balance sheet under GAAP. The amounts presented in the table below do not reflect $503 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, the timing of which is uncertain.

(c) Interest payments on long-term debt are projected for future periods using the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2009. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates. (d) As described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain leases require us to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises. These future costs are not included in the schedule above. (e) Consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. (f) Primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies and allowances, performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs, self-insurance and litigation claims, post-retirement benefits, certain pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities (excluding unrecognized tax benefits) and deferred compensation obligations. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations are based upon management’s estimates over the terms of these arrangements and are largely based upon historical experience. 53 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of off-balance sheet commercial commitments of the Company. Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period Total AmountsCommitted Less ThanOne Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years MoreThan5 Years ($ in millions) Standby Letters of Credit and Performance Bonds $ 291.6 $ 139.0 $ 86.9 $ 15.8 $ 49.9 Guarantees 47.8 28.2 5.8 2.4 11.4 Total $ 339.4 $ 167.2 $ 92.7 $ 18.2 $ 61.3 Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are generally issued to secure the Company’s obligations under short-term contracts to purchase raw materials and components and for performance under specific sales agreements. Guarantees are generally issued in connection with certain transactions with vendors, suppliers, and financing counterparties and governmental entities. Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters or tax matters. The Company cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations, warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions and has not included any such items in the table above, but does not believe that any such liability will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. In addition, as a result of these divestitures, as well as restructuring activities, certain properties leased by the Company have been sublet to third parties. In the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by such sub-lessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. In the normal course of business, the Company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the Company’s products or claims alleging that Company products infringe third-party intellectual property. The Company cannot estimate its maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions and has not accrued any liabilities in its consolidated financial statements or included any indemnification provisions in our contractual commitments table above. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations. The Company’s Certificate of Incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the Company, or by reason of serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to limited exceptions. Danaher’s Amended and Restated By-laws provide for similar indemnification rights. In addition, Danaher has executed with each of its directors and executive officers an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which Danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding. While the Company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage. 54 Table of Contents Legal Proceedings Please refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding certain litigation matters. In addition to the litigation matters noted under “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters – Environmental, Health & Safety,” the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to its business. These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Company’s products and services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition related matters. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, divested businesses. Some of these lawsuits may include claims for punitive and consequential, as well as compensatory damages. Based upon the Company’s experience, current information and applicable law, it does not believe that these proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on its cash flows, financial position or results of operations. While the Company maintains workers’ compensation, property, cargo, automobile, aviation, crime, fiduciary, product, general liability, and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (and has acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions) that it believes cover a portion of these claims, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses. In addition, while the Company believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims, these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses. The Company maintains third party insurance policies up to certain limits to cover certain liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts. For general liability risk (which includes product liability) and most other insured risks, the Company purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses (“stop loss” insurance) and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to amounts within the self-insured retention. The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company periodically assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes for these matters, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and if appropriate, recognizes a reserve for these contingencies. These reserves consist of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts for anticipated developments of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims. The specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified with the assistance of legal counsel and outside risk insurance professionals where appropriate. In addition, outside risk insurance professionals assist in the determination of reserves for incurred but not yet reported claims through evaluation of the Company’s specific loss history, actual claims reported, and industry trends among statistical and other factors. Reserve estimates are adjusted as additional information regarding a claim becomes known. While the Company actively pursues financial recoveries from insurance providers, it does not recognize any recoveries until realized or until such time as a sustained pattern of collections is established related to historical matters of a similar nature and magnitude. The Company believes the liability recorded for such risk insurance reserves as of December 31, 2009 is adequate, but due to judgments inherent in the reserve process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate. If the risk insurance reserves established are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s net earnings. Please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the amount of our accruals for self-insurance and litigation liability. For a discussion of additional risks related to existing and potential legal proceedings, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” 55 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments. The Company believes the following accounting policies are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, refer to Note 1 in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounts receivable. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company’s customers to make required payments. The Company estimates its anticipated losses from doubtful accounts based on historical collection history as well as by specifically reserving for known doubtful accounts. Estimating losses from doubtful accounts is inherently uncertain because the amount of such losses depends substantially on the financial condition of the Company’s customers, and the Company typically has limited visibility as to the specific financial state of its customers. The uncertain conditions in the global economy and credit markets have heightened the uncertainties related to customers’ ability to pay. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate beyond estimates, and impair their ability to make payments, the Company would be required to write off additional accounts receivable balances, which would adversely impact the Company’s net earnings and financial condition. Inventories. The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market value. The Company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand, technological advances and pricing competition in many of the Company’s markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the Company’s control. As a result, such fluctuations can be difficult to predict. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, the Company could be required to reduce the value of its inventory, which would adversely impact the Company’s net earnings and financial condition. Acquired intangibles. The Company’s business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the Company may incur. In accordance with accounting standards related to business combinations, goodwill amortization ceased effective January 1, 2002, however, amortization of certain identifiable intangible assets, primarily consisting of customer relationships and acquired technology, continues over the estimated useful lives of the identified asset. The Company is required, on at least an annual basis (the first day of the Company’s fiscal fourth quarter), to calculate the fair value of each of its reporting units and compare the calculated fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, this is an impairment indicator which necessitates additional analysis to determine if the reporting unit’s goodwill has been impaired. If circumstances or events occur prior to the date of the required annual assessment that indicate the potential diminution of fair value of a reporting unit, the Company performs an impairment analysis at the time of such change in circumstance or event. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market based approach. The Company estimates fair value based on EBITDA multiples determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the Company’s reporting units in addition to market available precedent transactions of comparable businesses. In evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach, management assesses the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including recent operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and other market data. The Company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (i.e., an income approach) in order to validate the results of the market approach in certain circumstances. Once completed, the results of the income and market approaches are reconciled and compared. The discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, 56 Table of Contents future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. While the Company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had 27 reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. The carrying value of the goodwill included in the Company’s individual reporting units ranges from approximately $5 million to approximately $2 billion. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2009 indicated that in all instances, the fair value of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units as of the first day of the Company’s fiscal fourth quarter, the annual testing date, ranged from approximately 3% to approximately 529%. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this sensitivity analysis, the Company identified three reporting units, with an aggregate $2.6 billion carrying value of goodwill, that have a reporting unit carrying value that would exceed fair value if the fair value of those reporting units decreased 10%. On an aggregate basis, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for these three reporting units is 6.5%. The application of the hypothetical 10% decrease in fair value for these three reporting units would result in an aggregate shortfall in fair value of 3.8% as compared to the aggregate carrying value of these three reporting units. Long-lived assets. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets were impaired, the Company would be required to recognize a charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. In determining the fair value of long-lived assets, the Company makes judgments relating to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and its ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets. Factors that impact these judgments include the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and anticipated future cash flows. If actual fair value is less than the Company’s estimates, long-lived assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and the Company would need to take a charge against net earnings. Contingent Liabilities. As discussed above under “—Legal Proceedings”, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business. The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liability estimates may change in the future due to new developments or changes in the Company’s settlement strategy. If the reserves established by the Company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s net earnings. Revenue Recognition: The Company derives revenues primarily from the sale of products and services. For revenue related to a product or service to qualify for recognition, there must be persuasive evidence of a sale, delivery must have occurred or the services must have been rendered, the price to the customer must be fixed and determinable and collectibility of the balance must be reasonably assured. The Company’s standard terms of sale are FOB Shipping Point and, as such, the Company principally records revenue for product sales upon shipment. If any significant obligations to the customer with respect to such sale remain to be fulfilled following shipment, typically involving obligations relating to installation and acceptance by the buyer, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled. Product returns consist of estimated returns for products sold and are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale. Customer allowances and rebates, consisting primarily of volume discounts and 57 Table of Contents other short-term incentive programs, are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale because these allowances reflect a reduction in the purchase price. Product returns, customer allowances and rebates are estimated based on historical experience and known trends. Revenue related to separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance agreements is recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement. Revenues for contractual arrangements consisting of multiple elements (i.e., deliverables) are recognized for the separate elements when the product or services have value on a stand-alone basis, fair value of the separate elements exists (or in the case of software related products, vendor specific objective evidence of fair value) and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in the Company’s control. While determining fair value and identifying separate elements requires judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are identifiable as those elements are also sold unaccompanied by other elements. Share-Based Compensation: The Company accounts for share-based compensation by measuring the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted, including stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted shares, based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date. Equity-based compensation expense is recognized net of an estimated forfeiture rate on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. In the case of performance based share-based awards, compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated attribution method. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the awards and stock price volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management’s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our equity-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the equity-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits: Certain of the Company’s employees and retired employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans (pension plans) and certain eligible retirees are entitled to health care and life insurance benefits under postretirement benefit plans (postretirement plans). The Company measures its pension and post retirement plans’ assets and obligations as of the end of each year to determine the funded status of each plan. The Company recognizes an asset for a plan’s overfunded status or a liability for a plan’s underfunded status in its statement of financial position. Changes in the funded status of the plans are recognized in the year in which the changes occur and are reported in comprehensive income. Accounting standards require that the amounts the Company records, including the expense or income, associated with the pension and postretirement plans be computed using actuarial valuations. Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations including assumptions relating to financial market and other economic conditions. The assumptions used in the actuarial valuation include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. Changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions used by the Company. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may affect the Company’s financial position or results of operations. For the U.S. plan, the Company used a 5.75% discount rate in computing the amount of the minimum pension liability to be recorded at December 31, 2009, which represents a decrease of 50 basis points in the discount rate from December 31, 2008. For non-U.S. plans, rates appropriate for each plan are determined based on investment grade instruments with maturities approximately equal to the average expected benefit payout under the plan. A 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate used for the plans would have increased the U.S. and non-U.S. net obligation by $54 million ($37 million on an after tax basis) from the amount recorded in the financial statements at December 31, 2009. For 2009, the expected long-term rate of return assumption applicable to assets held in the United States plan was estimated at 8% which is the same as the rate used in 2008. This expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation 58 Table of Contents of the plan and the expected long-term returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets. The U.S. plan targets to invest between 60% and 70% of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments. The balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in corporate bonds and bond index funds. Pension expense for the U.S. plan for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $3 million (or $2 million on an after-tax basis), compared with pension benefit of $5 million (or $3 million on an after-tax basis) for this plan in 2008. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was reduced by 0.5%, pension expense for 2009 would have increased $5 million (or $3 million on an after-tax basis). The Company made a voluntary contribution of $60 million to the U.S. plan in 2009. The Company’s non-U.S. plan assets are comprised of various insurance contracts, equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan. The estimated long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 0.75% to 8.0% for 2009 and ranged from 1.5% to 8.25% for 2008. For a discussion of the Company’s 2009 and anticipated 2010 defined benefit pension plan contributions, please see “Liquidity and Capital Resources —Cash and Cash Requirements”. New Accounting Standards In December 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2010-02, “Accounting and Reporting for Decreases in Ownership of a Subsidiary – a Scope Clarification.” The update revises the accounting requirements for decreases in ownership of a subsidiary that were originally contained in FASB Statement No. 160 on non-controlling interests (currently codified in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810, Consolidation). The revised decrease in ownership provisions require an entity that ceases to have a controlling interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business to recognize a gain or loss on the transaction and include an amount for the remeasurement of any retained investment to fair value. A decrease in ownership that does not result in a loss of control is accounted for as an equity transaction with no gain or loss recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the portion of the subsidiary or group of assets that is sold and consideration received from the buyer. The update is effective from the effective date of FASB Statement No. 160, which was January 1, 2009 for the Company. The adoption of the ASU did not have a material impact to the Company, however, the requirements of this update will be required to be applied to any future transactions that results in a decreases in ownership of businesses owned by the Company. In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13, “Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements.” This ASU establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenue-generating activities and provides amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables and measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting. The amendments also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. Significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendor’s multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements, including information about the nature and terms, significant deliverables, and its performance within arrangements. The amendments also require providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of the relative selling-price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition. The new ASU requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2010, which is the Company’s 2011 fiscal year. Early adoption of the standard is permitted and various options for prospective or retroactive adoption are available. The Company is currently in the process of reviewing and evaluating the impact of these new requirements. Concurrent with the issuance of ASU No. 2009-13, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-14, “Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements.” This ASU changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements that are “essential to the functionality,” and scopes these products out of current software revenue guidance. The new guidance includes factors to help companies determine what software elements are considered “essential to the functionality.” The amendments will now subject software-enabled products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements, such as guidance surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. The amendments in this ASU are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in the fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, which is the Company’s 2011 fiscal year. Early adoption of the standard is permitted and various options for prospective or retroactive adoption are available. The Company is in the process of reviewing and evaluating the impact of these new requirements. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

Materials Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of raw materials, including steel, copper, cast iron, electronic components, aluminum, plastics and other petroleum-based products. Prices of oil and gas also affect our costs for freight and utilities. We purchase raw materials from a large number of independent sources around the world. No single supplier is material, although for some components that require particular specifications there may be a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components. We utilize a number of techniques to address potential disruption in our supply chain, including the use of alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources. During 2010 we had no raw material shortages that had a material adverse effect on our business. For a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Intellectual Property We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses to intellectual property owned by others. Although in aggregate our intellectual property is important to our operations, we do not consider any single patent or trademark to be of material importance to any segment or to the business as a whole. From time to time we engage in litigation to protect our intellectual property rights. For a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” All capitalized brands and product names throughout this document are trademarks owned by, or licensed to, Danaher or its subsidiaries. Competition Although our businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets, our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all of the same product lines or serve all of the same markets as we do. Because of the diversity of the products we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors, including well-established regional competitors, competitors who are more specialized than we are in particular markets, as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales, marketing, research, and financial capabilities. We are facing increased competition in a number of our served markets as a result of the entry of new, large companies into certain markets, the entry of competitors based in low-cost manufacturing locations, and increasing consolidation in particular markets. The number of competitors varies by product line. Our management believes that we have a market leadership position in many of the markets we serve. Key competitive factors vary among our businesses and product lines, but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business and typically also include price, quality, delivery speed, service and support, innovation, distribution network, breadth of product and service offerings and brand name recognition. For a discussion of risks related to competition, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” 11 Table of Contents Seasonal Nature of Business General economic conditions impact our business and financial results, and certain of our businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end-markets that they serve. For example, European sales are often weaker in the summer months, medical and capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter, sales to original equipment manufacturers are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products, and sales to the United States government are often stronger in the third calendar quarter. However, as a whole, we are not subject to material seasonality. Working Capital We maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs. There are no unusual industry practices or requirements relating to working capital items. In addition, our sales and payment terms are generally similar to those of our competitors. Backlog The table below provides the unfulfilled orders attributable to each of our five segments at the end of 2010 and 2009 ($ in millions): As of December 31 Segment 2010 2009 Test & Measurement $ 641 $ 515 Environmental 382 342 Life Sciences & Diagnostics 186 156 Dental 71 66 Industrial Technologies 885 752 Businesses contributed to the Apex Joint Venture — 56 Total $ 2,165 $ 1,887 We expect that a large majority of these unfilled orders will be delivered to customers within 3 to 4 months. Given the relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover that are characteristic of most of our products and the shortening of product life cycles, we believe that backlog is indicative of short-term revenue performance but not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term performance. Employee Relations At December 31, 2010, we employed approximately 48,200 persons, of whom approximately 21,400 were employed in the United States and approximately 26,800 were employed outside of the United States. Of our United States employees, approximately 1,560 were hourly-rated, unionized employees. Outside the United States, we have government-mandated collective bargaining arrangements and union contracts in certain countries, particularly in Europe where many of our employees are represented by unions and/or works councils. For a discussion of risks related to employee relations, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Research and Development The table below describes our research and development expenditures over each of the last three years, by segment and in the aggregate ($ in millions): For the Years Ended December 31 Segment 2010 2009 2008 Test & Measurement $ 258 $ 216 $ 262 Environmental 136 116 114 Life Sciences & Diagnostics 193 117 131 Dental 73 52 59 Industrial Technologies 146 126 152 Businesses contributed to the Apex Joint Venture 3 6 7 Total $ 809 $ 633 $ 725 12 Table of Contents We conduct research and development activities for the purpose of developing new products, enhancing the functionality, effectiveness, ease of use and reliability of our existing products and expanding the applications for which uses of our products are appropriate. Our research and development efforts include internal initiatives and those that use licensed or acquired technology. The Company conducts research and development activities on a business-by-business basis, primarily in North America, Europe and Asia. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide a continuing flow of innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position. For a discussion of the risks related to the need to develop and commercialize new products and product enhancements, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Customer-sponsored research and development was not significant in 2010, 2009 or 2008. Government Contracts Although the substantial majority of our revenue in 2010 was from customers other than governmental entities, we have agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities, primarily involving products in the aerospace and defense, motion, test & measurement, life sciences & diagnostics, water quality, product identification, and sensors and controls businesses. As a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments. For a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Regulatory Matters We face comprehensive government regulation both within and outside the United States relating to the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of our products and services. The following sections describe certain significant regulations that we are subject to. Environmental Laws and Regulations Our operations, products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use, generation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. A number of our operations involve the handling, manufacturing, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the United States and abroad in connection with our operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and, based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, and we do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. For a discussion of risks related to compliance with environmental and health and safety laws, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” In addition to environmental compliance costs, we from time to time incur costs related to alleged damages associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. For example, generators of hazardous substances found in disposal sites at which environmental problems are alleged to exist, as well as the current and former owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons, are subject to claims brought by state and federal regulatory agencies pursuant to statutory authority. We have received notification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and from state and non-U.S. environmental agencies, that conditions at certain sites where we and others previously disposed of hazardous wastes and/or are or were property owners require clean-up and other possible remedial action, including sites where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under U.S. federal and state environmental laws. We have projects underway at a number of current and former facilities, in both the United States and abroad, to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. Remediation activities generally involve soil and/or groundwater contamination and may include pre-remedial activities such as fact-finding and investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study, and/or design, as well as remediation actions such as contaminant removal, monitoring and/or installation, operation and maintenance of longer-term remediation systems. We are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. 13 Table of Contents We have made a provision for environmental investigation and remediation and environmental-related claims with respect to sites owned or formerly owned by the Company and its subsidiaries and third-party sites where we have been determined to be a potentially responsible party. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the amount of our environmental provisions. We generally make an assessment of the costs involved for our remediation efforts based on environmental studies, as well as our prior experience with similar sites. If we determine that potential liability for a particular site or with respect to a personal injury claim is probable and reasonably estimable, we accrue the total estimated costs, including investigation and remediation costs, associated with the site or claim. While we actively pursue insurance recoveries, as well as recoveries from other potentially responsible parties, we do not recognize any insurance recoveries for environmental liability claims until realized or until such time as a sustained pattern of collections is established related to historical matters of a similar nature and magnitude. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties of our involvement in certain sites, uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the availability of alternative cleanup methods, variations in the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the possibility of insurance recoveries with respect to certain sites and the fact that imposition of joint and several liability with right of contribution is possible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and other environmental laws and regulations. All provisions have been recorded without giving effect to any possible future third party recoveries. For the reasons described above, we cannot assure you that our estimates of environmental liabilities will not change. In view of our financial position and provisions for environmental remediation matters and other environmental-related claims and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, we believe that our liability related to past or current waste disposal practices and other hazardous materials handling practices will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. For a discussion of risks related to past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Medical Devices Certain of our products are medical devices that are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and by the comparable agencies of the non-U.S. countries where our products are sold. Some of the regulatory requirements of these foreign countries are different than those applicable in the United States. Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), the FDA regulates virtually all phases of the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of medical devices, including their introduction into interstate commerce, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution and record keeping. Pursuant to the FDCA and FDA regulations, certain facilities of our operating subsidiaries are registered with the FDA as medical device manufacturing establishments. The FDA, as well as industrial standards bodies such as the International Standards Organization (“ISO”), regularly inspect our registered and/or certified facilities. We sell both Class I and Class II medical devices. A medical device, whether exempt from, or cleared pursuant to, the premarket notification requirements of the FDCA, or approved pursuant to a premarket approval application, is subject to ongoing regulatory oversight by the FDA to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to, product labeling requirements and limitations, including those related to promotion and marketing efforts, quality system requirements and medical device (adverse event) reporting. Certain of our products utilize radioactive material, and we are subject to federal, state and local regulations governing the management, storage, handling and disposal of these materials. In addition, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. For a discussion of risks related to our regulation by the FDA and comparable agencies of other countries, and other regulatory regimes referenced above, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Export/Import Compliance We are required to comply with various U.S. export/import control and economic sanctions laws, including: • the International Traffic in Arms Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, which, among other things, imposes license requirements on the export from the United States of defense articles and defense services (which are items specifically designed or adapted for a military application and/or listed on the United States Munitions List); 14 Table of Contents • the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, which, among other things, impose licensing requirements on the export or re-export of certain dual-use goods, technology and software (which are items that potentially have both commercial and military applications); • the regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control, which implement economic sanctions imposed against designated countries, governments and persons based on United States foreign policy and national security considerations; and • the import regulatory activities of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Other nations’ governments have implemented similar export and import control regulations, which may affect our operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions. For a discussion of risks related to export/import control and economic sanctions laws, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” International Operations Our products and services are available worldwide, and our principal markets outside the United States are in Europe and Asia. We also have operations around the world, and this geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce, provides stability to our operations, allows us to drive economies of scale, provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for products. In addition, we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that successfully target developing countries. The table below describes annual revenue derived from customers outside the U.S. as a percentage of total annual revenue for each of the last three years, by segment and in the aggregate: Year Ended December 31 Segment 2010 2009 2008 Test & Measurement 49 % 50 % 52 % Environmental 53 % 51 % 54 % Life Sciences & Diagnostics 70 % 73 % 74 % Dental 58 % 57 % 56 % Industrial Technologies 52 % 49 % 50 % Businesses contributed to the Apex Joint Venture 22 % 20 % 22 % Total percentage of revenue derived from customers outside of the United States 55 % 52 % 53 % The table below describes long-lived assets located outside the United States as a percentage of total long-lived assets at the end of each of the last three years, by segment and in the aggregate: Year Ended December 31 Segment 2010 2009 2008 Test & Measurement 17 % 20 % 18 % Environmental 44 % 43 % 47 % Life Sciences & Diagnostics 85 % 89 % 94 % Dental 34 % 39 % 33 % Industrial Technologies 21 % 19 % 18 % Businesses contributed to the Apex Joint Venture — 9 % 12 % Total percentage of long-lived assets located outside of the United States 39 % 38 % 37 % 15 Table of Contents For additional information related to revenues and long-lived assets by country, please refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and for information regarding deferred taxes by geography, please refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The manner in which our products and services are sold outside the United States differs by business and by region. Most of our sales in non-U.S. markets are made by our subsidiaries located outside the United States, though we also sell directly from the U.S. into non-U.S. markets through various representatives and distributors. In countries with low sales volumes, we generally sell through representatives and distributors. Financial information about our international operations is contained in Note 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements and information about the possible effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our business is set forth in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For a discussion of risks related to our non-US operations and foreign currency exchange, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Major Customers No customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated sales in 2010, 2009 or 2008. Available Information We maintain an internet website at www.danaher.com. We make available free of charge on the website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material with, or furnishing such material to, the SEC. Our Internet site and the information contained on or connected to that site are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as U.S. and non-U.S. economic and financial market conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Instability in the global economy and financial markets may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Our business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. The global economic turmoil that began in 2008 continued through 2009, involving widespread recessionary conditions, record levels of unemployment in some countries and volatility in and tightening of the capital and credit markets. During 2010, the Company began to see signs of an economic recovery in many markets. However, we cannot assure you that these improvements will be broad-based and sustainable and will benefit all of the markets we serve, or that we will not experience further adverse effects from broad economic trends. Instability in the global economy and financial markets can adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, including having the effect of: • reducing demand for our products and services, increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies; • increasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories; • increasing price competition in our served markets; • resulting in supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; • increasing the risk of impairment of long-lived assets due to underutilized manufacturing capacity; and 16 Table of Contents • increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which, in addition to increasing the risks identified above, could result in preference actions against us. Although we have been able to continue accessing the commercial paper markets through the date of this report, if conditions in the financial markets worsen there can be no assurances that the commercial paper markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations. In addition, the failure of one of more of the syndicate members in our credit facilities could reduce the availability of credit and harm our liquidity. The restructuring actions that we have taken to reduce costs could have long-term adverse effects on our business. In 2008 and 2009, we implemented significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure. These restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities have the effect of reducing our available talent, assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and technologies, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly as demand for our products increases. These circumstances could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve, and visibility into our markets is limited (particularly markets into which we sell through distribution). Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, in certain of our businesses product demand depends on the customer’s capital spending budget as well as government funding policies, and matters of public policy as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period. We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may face decreased demand, decreased market share or price reductions for our products. Our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and that in many cases have been subject to increasing consolidation. Because of the diversity of products we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors; please see “Item 1. Business – Competition” for additional details. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product categories and penetrate new markets, including in developing countries. Our failure to compete effectively may adversely affect our revenues, profitability and cash flow, and pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our revenues and profitability. Our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation. We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation on a timely basis, our products will become obsolete over time and our revenues, cash flow, profitability and competitive position will suffer. Our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to: • correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences; • allocate our research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects; • anticipate and respond to our competitors’ development of new products and technological innovations; 17 Table of Contents • differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings; • innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets; • obtain adequate intellectual property rights; • successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time; and • encourage customers to adopt new technologies. In addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. Any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price. We may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price. Promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including high valuations, competition among prospective buyers, the need for regulatory (including antitrust) approvals and the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets. In addition, competition for acquisitions in our business areas is significant and may result in higher purchase prices. Changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions. Our ability to grow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate companies and businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated cost savings. Our acquisition of businesses could negatively impact our profitability and return on invested capital. As part of our business strategy we acquire businesses in the ordinary course, some of which may be material; please see the section titled “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Investing Activities” in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) for additional details. Our acquisitions involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational and other risks and challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our profitability and return on invested capital: • Any acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it, or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable. • Acquisitions could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations in any given period, or over the long-term. • Acquisition-related earnings charges (including both pre-closing and post-closing charges) could adversely impact operating results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period to period. • Acquisitions could create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are not equipped to handle. • We could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other systems and retaining key employees and customers. • We may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition. • We may assume by acquisition unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, or internal control deficiencies. The realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations. • In connection with acquisitions, we often enter into post-closing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments, earn-out obligations and indemnification obligations, which may have unpredictable financial results • As a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded significant goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets on our balance sheet. If we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets. 18 Table of Contents The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities. Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position. Divestitures could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. Divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business, including potentially dilutive impacts on the Company’s earnings per share and other accounting impacts, potential disputes with buyers and distraction of management. In addition, we have retained responsibility for and/or have agreed to indemnify buyers against some the known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold, such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims and environmental matters. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue. We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. At December 31, 2010, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets totaled approximately $12.2 billion. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair these assets. Any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized. Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products and services purchased overseas. Our sales and expenses are also translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects. In addition, certain of our businesses may invoice customers in a currency other than the business’ functional currency, and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable translation effects. Our reputation, ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners. We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits and could damage our reputation. Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Please see the section titled “Income Taxes” in the MD&A for a discussion of the factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and 19 Table of Contents decrease our profitability in any period. The impact of these factors may be substantially different from period to period. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. Due to the ambiguity of tax laws and the subjectivity of factual interpretations, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. If these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities. The Obama administration has announced proposals to tax profits of U.S. companies earned abroad. While it is not possible for us to predict whether any such proposals will be implemented, or how they will ultimately impact us, they may adversely impact our results of operations. If we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights. We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our operations. The intellectual property rights that we obtain, however, may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. In addition, the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented or designed-around, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property, could adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights. Third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services. From time to time, we receive notices from third parties regarding intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. Any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to critical technology, be unable to license critical technology, be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our competitive position, revenues, profitability and cash flows. Even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows. We are subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims for damages arising out of the use of our products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition-related matters. These lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our financial condition, operations and results of operations. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us 20 Table of Contents against such losses. In addition, developments in legal proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, make estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows in any particular period. Our operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and reputation. Our operations, products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use, generation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the U.S. and abroad in connection with our operations. We cannot assure you that our environmental, health and safety compliance program has been or will be at all times effective. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. We may also become subject to additional remedial, compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules. For additional information regarding these risks, please refer to “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters.” We cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and reputation or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. Product defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. Manufacturing or design defects (including in components that we source from third parties), unanticipated use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to personal injury, death or property damage. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products, result in the removal of a product from the market and result in product liability claims being brought against us. Recalls and product liability claims can result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products. Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to the environmental, health and safety regulations noted above, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the federal, state and local levels, including the following: • We are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons and dealings between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory. • Certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the FDA, by comparable agencies of other countries and by regulations governing the management, storage, handling and disposal of (or manufacture and sale of products containing) hazardous or radioactive materials. We cannot 21 Table of Contents guarantee that we will be able to obtain clearance for our new products or modifications to existing products, and if we do such clearance may be time-consuming, costly and restrictive. Violations of these regulations, efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products can lead to warning letters, declining sales, recalls, seizures, injunctions, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, suspension or withdrawal of approvals and pre-market notification rescissions. In addition, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. • We also have agreements to sell products and services to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. Our agreements with government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification at the convenience of the government or in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors. Government contracts that have been awarded to us following a bid process could become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder, which could result in loss of the contract. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts. Any failure to comply with these requirements could result in suspension of these contracts and the Company’s suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting. These are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. Failure to comply with these or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to manufacture, import and export products and services, disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and damage to our reputation. Compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses. Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the ISO, and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our results of operations. For additional information regarding these risks, please refer to “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters.” Our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow, and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $2.8 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, based on the credit support provided by our credit facilities as of December 31, 2010, we had the ability to incur an additional $1.35 billion of indebtedness under our outstanding commercial paper facilities. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: • requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and capital investment; • reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and • exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. We may incur significantly more debt in the future, particularly in connection with acquisitions. If we add new debt, the risks described above could increase. Our current revolving credit facilities and long-term debt obligations impose certain restrictions on us; for more information please refer to the MD&A. If we breach any of these restrictions and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. 22 Table of Contents Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. We may incur higher costs to produce our products if commodity prices rise. As discussed in “Item 1. Business – Materials,” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of raw materials. Prices for these raw materials have fluctuated significantly in the past. Due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve, the cost-containment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to, if commodity prices rise we may be unable to fully pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we are unable to fully recover higher raw material costs through price increases or offset these increases through other cost reductions, or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs, we could experience lower margins and profitability and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. If we cannot adjust the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changing market conditions or customer demand, our profitability may suffer. In addition, our reliance upon sole sources of supply for certain materials and components could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies. We purchase materials, components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations. Our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations, including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality. During a market upturn, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices. If we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand, we may not be able to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed or our costs may increase. Conversely, in order to secure supplies for the production of products, we sometimes enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer. In addition, some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. If these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply and could face production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies. If we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity to reflect the demand for our products, our profitability may suffer. Because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements. Any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results. Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as regulations governing health and safety, the environment, food and drugs and electronic communications. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Any significant change in any of these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products. In addition, in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations. In these markets, the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations, or the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address, could adversely affect our growth rate. In addition, the manner in which regulations and related deadlines impact demand for our products may be substantially different from period to period. 23 Table of Contents We may be unable to adjust to changes in the healthcare industry, some of which could adversely affect our business. The healthcare industry has undergone, and is in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs. These changes include the recently enacted U.S. legislation on healthcare reform, healthcare austerity measures in Europe, wider implementation of managed care, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates. Some of these potential changes may cause healthcare-industry participants to purchase fewer of our products and services, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services, reduce the amounts of reimbursement available for our products from governmental agencies or third-party payors, reduce the volume of medical procedures or impose excise taxes on medical device companies. These changes could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Work stoppages, union and works council campaigns, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force could adversely impact our results of operations and cause us to incur incremental costs. We have a number of U.S. collective bargaining units and various non-U.S. collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and potential labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations. Adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns of, key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our results of operations. Certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and end-users. Some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products, and if they favor our competitors’ products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. Adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners, or adverse developments in their financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Changes in the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period. In addition, the consolidation of distributors in certain of our served industries, as well as the formation of large and sophisticated purchasing groups in industries such as healthcare, could adversely impact our profitability. International economic, political, legal and business factors could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In 2010, approximately 55% of our sales were derived from customers outside the U.S. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located outside the U.S. Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the U.S. and increase the localization of our products and services, we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the U.S., particularly in emerging markets. Our international business is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations, including: • interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers; • differences in terms of sale, including payment terms; • local product preferences and product requirements; • changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions (including safety and health issues); • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; • unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including negative changes in tax laws; • limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash; • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; • differing labor regulations; • difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis; and • differing protection of intellectual property. Any of these risks could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and growth. 24 Table of Contents If we suffer loss to our facilities, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed. Our facilities, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. If any of these facilities or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. The third-party insurance coverage that we maintain with respect to these and other risks will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against losses. We own a 50% interest in but do not control the Apex Tool Group joint venture, and as a result we may not be able to direct management of the joint venture in a manner that we believe is in Danaher’s best interests. In 2010, Danaher and Cooper Industries plc formed a joint venture named Apex Tool Group LLC. Each company contributed its respective tools business to, and received a 50% interest in, the joint venture. Our joint venture partner may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint venture. Since we do not control the joint venture, we may not be able to direct the management and operations of the joint venture in the manner that we believe is most appropriate. In addition, the joint venture agreement gives each party veto rights with respect to certain fundamental corporate actions, and as a result we cannot assure you that we could effect certain fundamental corporate actions that we believe would be in Danaher’s best interests. Any of these circumstances and any conflict that may arise between the parties could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate headquarters are located in Washington, D.C. in a facility that we lease. At December 31, 2010, we had approximately 219 significant manufacturing and distribution facilities worldwide. 112 of these facilities are located in the United States in over 30 states and 107 are located outside the United States in over 50 other countries, primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia, the rest of North America, Latin America and Australia. These facilities cover approximately 18.6 million square feet, of which approximately 12.0 million square feet are owned and approximately 6.6 million square feet are leased. Particularly outside the United States, facilities often serve more than one business segment and may be used for multiple purposes, such as administration, sales, manufacturing, warehousing and/or distribution. The number of significant facilities by business segment is: • Test & Measurement, 40; • Environmental, 42; • Life Sciences & Diagnostics, 37; • Dental, 34; and • Industrial Technologies, 66. We consider our facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used and do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. Please refer to Note 12 in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information with respect to our lease commitments. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In 2010, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (“DTSC”) alleged that the Paso Robles, California facility of Joslyn Sunbank Company LLC (“Sunbank”), an indirect subsidiary of the Company, violated certain provisions of the California Hazardous Waste Control Law (“HWCL”) by submitting insufficient documentation 25 Table of Contents from 2005 to 2009 relating to financial assurance for closure costs, and failing to adhere to wastewater requirements during a certain period of operation. The DTSC has acknowledged that Sunbank is no longer in violation of the HWCL or related regulations and that Sunbank has taken appropriate corrective action in response to the alleged violations. On December 1, 2010, the DTSC and Sunbank settled the alleged violations for a payment of $135,000, as well as payment of the DTSC’s administrative costs with respect to this matter, financing of a supplemental environmental project and certain injunctive relief. This matter did not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.

As of February 11, 2011, there were approximately 3,731 holders of record of our common stock. The high and low common stock prices per share as reported on the New York Stock Exchange, and the dividends paid per share, in each case for the periods described below, were as follows: 2010 2009 High Low DividendsPer Share High Low DividendsPer Share First quarter $ 40.38 $ 35.01 $ 0.02 $ 29.95 $ 23.87 $ 0.01 Second quarter $ 43.65 $ 36.22 $ 0.02 $ 32.45 $ 26.19 $ 0.01 Third quarter $ 41.43 $ 35.71 $ 0.02 $ 34.50 $ 28.52 $ 0.02 Fourth quarter $ 47.35 $ 39.70 $ 0.02 $ 38.28 $ 32.20 $ 0.02 Our payment of dividends in the future will be determined by our Board of Directors and will depend on business conditions, our earnings and other factors. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities There were no repurchases of equity securities during 2010. On May 11, 2010, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20 million shares of the Company’s common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions (which repurchase program replaced the repurchase program that was authorized by the Board in April 2005). There is no expiration date for the Company’s repurchase program. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by the Company’s management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Company’s equity compensation plans (or any successor plans) and for other corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2010, 20 million shares remain available for repurchase pursuant to this program. Recent Issuances of Unregistered Securities During the fourth quarter of 2010, holders of certain of the Company’s Liquid Yield Option Notes (LYONs) converted such LYONs into an aggregate of 798,151 shares of Danaher common stock, par value $0.01 per share. From January 1, 2011 through February 11, 2011, holders of certain of the Company’s Liquid Yield Option Notes (LYONs) converted such LYONs into an aggregate of 5,193,146 shares of Danaher common stock, par value $0.01 28 Table of Contents per share.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide a reader of Danaher’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of Company management. The Company’s MD&A is divided into four main sections: • Overview • Results of Operations • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Critical Accounting Estimates OVERVIEW General Please see “Item 1. Business – General” for a discussion of Danaher’s objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value. Danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations. During 2010, approximately 55% of Danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the United States. As a global business, Danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors. For example, in those industry segments where the Company is a capital equipment provider, revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of the Company’s customers, who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy. Danaher’s geographic and industry diversity, as well as the diversity of its products and services, typically helps limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results. Given the broad range of products manufactured and geographies served, management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the Company. The Company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future. As a result of our geographic and industry diversity we face a variety of challenges and opportunities, including rapid technological development in most of our served markets, the expansion of opportunities in emerging markets, trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force and consolidation of our competitors. We operate in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and our long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on our ability to expand our business (including through geographical and product line expansion), identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative new products and services with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of our sales force and continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality. We are making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in our served markets and to globalize our manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources (particularly in emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil) in order to improve the efficiency of our operations and be responsive to our customers throughout the world. Business Performance and Outlook While differences exist among the Company’s businesses, on an overall basis, demand for the Company’s products and services increased substantially in 2010 as compared to 2009 resulting in aggregate year-over-year sales growth. The growth in sales is due in part to the stabilization in global economic conditions that began in the fourth quarter 2009, easier year-over-year comparisons resulting from the recessionary economic conditions that prevailed during most of 2009, investments made in sales growth initiatives and other business-specific factors discussed below. Year-over-year sales growth rates during 2010 were led by emerging markets, with particular strength in China. North America and Europe also grew on a year-over-year basis, but at a lesser rate than the emerging markets. Providing no significant deterioration in general economic conditions occurs, the Company expects sales to continue to grow on a year-over-year basis during 2011 but at a moderating rate from that experienced during 2010 due primarily to more difficult year-over-year comparisons. 31 Table of Contents Acquisitions; Joint Venture with Cooper Industries plc On January 30, 2010, the Company completed the acquisition of the Analytical Technologies division of MDS Inc., which includes a 50% ownership position in the Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex joint venture (“AB Sciex”) and a 100% ownership position in the Molecular Devices business (“Molecular Devices”). In a separate but related transaction, the Company simultaneously completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership position in AB Sciex from Life Technologies Corporation. The aggregate purchase price for the combined transactions was $1.1 billion, including debt assumed and net of cash acquired. The aggregate sales of AB Sciex and Molecular Devices in their last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition were approximately $650 million and these businesses now operate within the Company’s Life Sciences & Diagnostics segment. The acquisitions of AB Sciex and Molecular Devices significantly expand the Company’s position in the life sciences and diagnostics business and in particular establish a position in the mass spectrometry market. AB Sciex is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities in the Company’s Life Sciences & Diagnostics segment, both through the growth of existing products and services and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses. Company management and other personnel are devoting significant resources to the successful integration of the acquired businesses into Danaher. In addition to the acquisitions of AB Sciex and Molecular Devices, the Company acquired 17 businesses during 2010 for aggregate consideration of approximately $1.1 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. These businesses were acquired to complement existing units of the Life Sciences & Diagnostics, Test & Measurement, Dental, Environmental and Industrial Technologies segments. The aggregate annual sales of these 17 acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $440 million. On July 4, 2010, the Company entered into a joint venture with Cooper Industries, plc (“Cooper”), combining certain of the Company’s hand tool manufacturing and distribution businesses with Cooper’s Tools business to form a new entity called Apex Tool Group, LLC (“Apex”). The 2009 sales, on a combined basis, of the two tools businesses contributed to Apex were approximately $1.2 billion. Each of Cooper and the Company owns a 50% interest in Apex and has an equal number of representatives on Apex’s Board of Directors. Upon the closing of the transaction, Apex simultaneously obtained a credit facility and term debt financing and used $45 million of the term debt financing to purchase from the Company certain assets of the Company’s hand tools business. In addition to the cash received for the purchase of these assets, the Company recorded a receivable from Apex of $45 million upon closing. Subsequent to the formation of the joint venture, the Company collected $11.3 million from Apex related to the receivable and expects to the collect the balance in 2011. As of the closing of the transaction, the Company deconsolidated the financial results of its contributed businesses and began accounting for its investment in the joint venture based on the equity method of accounting. In accordance with accounting standards applicable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries, the Company recognized a $291 million gain ($232.2 million or $0.34 per diluted share on an after-tax basis) during the third quarter 2010 associated with the transaction reflecting the difference between the book value of the contributed business that was deconsolidated and the fair value of the consideration received in exchange, including the 50% interest in Apex and the cash and receivables received from Apex in connection with the transaction. Recent Acquisition and Divestiture Developments In January 2011, the Company announced that it has agreed to sell its Pacific Scientific Aerospace business for a sale price of $685 million in cash. This business, which is part of the Industrial Technologies segment and supplies safety, security and electric power components to commercial and military aerospace markets globally, had annual revenues of $378 million in 2010. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals and the absence of a material adverse change with respect to the business, and is expected to close in the first half of 2011. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company expects to report an after-tax gain on the sale of approximately $200 million or $0.29 per diluted share. The Company committed to sell the business subsequent to the end of 2010 and will be reporting the business as a discontinued operation in future filings. Also in January 2011, the Company announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire EskoArtwork, a leading full service solutions provider for the digital packaging design and production market, for a purchase price of approximately €350 million ($470 million based on exchange rates on the date of the agreement), net of cash acquired. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals 32 Table of Contents and the absence of a material adverse change with respect to EskoArtwork, and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2011. EskoArtwork’s suite of software and hardware solutions helps its customers reduce digital design cycle time and ensure integrity throughout the packaging material supply chain. EskoArtwork had revenues of $247 million (based on exchange rates at December 31, 2010) in its most recent completed fiscal year and is expected to become part of the Company’s product identification platform included in the Industrial Technologies segment. On February 6, 2011, the Company and Beckman Coulter, Inc. entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which the Company is making a cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Beckman Coulter for $83.50 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $6.8 billion including debt assumed and net of cash acquired, to be followed by a second step cash-out merger at the offer price. The offer is subject to customary conditions, including tender of a majority of the outstanding shares (on a fully diluted basis) into the offer, receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and the absence of a material adverse change with respect to Beckman Coulter. The Company anticipates completing the offer in the first half of 2011. Beckman Coulter develops, manufactures and markets products that simplify, automate and innovate complex biomedical testing. Its diagnostic systems are found in hospitals and other clinical settings around the world and produce information used by physicians to diagnose disease, make treatment decisions and monitor patients. Scientists use its life science research instruments to study complex biological problems including causes of disease and potential new therapies or drugs. Beckman Coulter had revenues of approximately $3.7 billion in 2010, and would become part of the Company’s Life Sciences & Diagnostics segment. The Company anticipates financing the acquisition of Beckman Coulter through a combination of available cash, proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and proceeds from the issuance of securities. The Company may also enter into one or more additional credit facilities in order to expand borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program and issue commercial paper in amounts in excess of the program’s current capacity, and may also enter into one or more bridge loan agreements to provide temporary financing pending the implementation of more permanent financing arrangements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 18.0% compared to 2009. Sales from existing businesses increased 11.5% on a year-over-year basis. The impact of currency translation decreased reported sales by 0.5% as the U.S. dollar was, on average, slightly stronger against other major currencies during 2010 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2009. Acquired businesses provided sales growth of approximately 7.0%. In this report, references to sales from existing businesses refers to sales calculated according to GAAP but excluding (1) sales from acquired businesses, (2) second half 2009 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the Apex joint venture, and (3) the impact of currency translation. References to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition. The portion of sales attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in sales (excluding sales from acquired businesses and second half 2009 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the Apex joint venture) and (b) the period-to-period change in sales (excluding the same items) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. Sales from existing businesses should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting sales from existing businesses provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from sales from existing businesses because currency translation is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions because the nature, size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends. The Company excludes the effect of the second half 2009 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the Apex joint venture because as a result of application of the equity method of accounting beginning with the formation of the joint venture on July 4, 2010, the Company did not recognize sales from those businesses in the second half of 2010. Operating profit margins were 16.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 13.8% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in operating profit margins reflects the impact of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 as well as cost savings attributable to the Company’s 2009 restructuring activities. Year-over-year operating margin comparisons also benefited from approximately 160 basis points of incremental restructuring costs 33 Table of Contents incurred during 2009 as compared to 2010. The favorable settlement of litigation with Align Technologies in the third quarter 2009 adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 75 basis points. The net dilutive effect of acquired businesses, 2009 divestitures and the operating profit margin impact of contributing certain businesses to the Apex joint venture adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by approximately 65 basis points. Acquisition related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances as well as 2010 transaction costs deemed significant by the Company (net of comparable acquisition related charges and costs recorded in the comparable period of 2009) also adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 35 basis points as such charges and costs were greater in 2010 than in 2009. Operating profit margins were 13.8% in the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 14.7% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in operating profit margins during 2009 is primarily a result of lower sales volumes in 2009 compared to 2008, as well as restructuring costs incurred during 2009 in excess of the level incurred during 2008 which reduced operating profit margin comparisons by 115 basis points on a year-over-year basis. In addition, the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses had a net adverse impact of 20 basis points on year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. Cost savings realized in 2009 attributable to the Company’s 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses partially offset the reductions in operating profit margins. The gain recognized during 2009 in connection with the Align litigation settlement also favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 75 basis points. In addition, accounting charges recorded in 2008 associated with recording the fair value of inventory and deferred revenue acquired in connection with the November 2007 acquisition of Tektronix (net of comparable acquisition-related charges recorded in 2009) favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 10 basis points as such charges were greater in 2008 than 2009. Business Segments During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company changed the composition of its reportable segments to reflect changes in its internal organization resulting from the rate of growth within certain of the Company’s businesses and the contribution of certain of the Company’s hand tool manufacturing and distribution businesses to the Apex joint venture. The Company now reports results in five separate business segments consisting of the Test & Measurement; Environmental; Life Sciences & Diagnostics; Dental; and Industrial Technologies segments. In addition, the historical results of the hand tool businesses contributed to Apex and the Company’s equity in earnings of the Apex joint venture will be shown separately in the Company’s segment disclosures. The Company previously reported its operations under four segments: Professional Instrumentation; Medical Technologies; Industrial Technologies; and Tools & Components. The table below summarizes sales by business segment for each of the periods indicated ($ in millions): For the Year Ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 Test & Measurement $ 2,832.9 $ 2,221.3 $ 2,805.0 Environmental 2,738.0 2,418.7 2,413.2 Life Sciences & Diagnostics 2,298.3 1,484.9 1,481.5 Dental 1,824.6 1,657.0 1,795.5 Industrial Technologies 3,193.2 2,795.1 3,471.0 Businesses contributed to Apex joint venture 315.6 607.9 731.3 Total $ 13,202.6 $ 11,184.9 $ 12,697.5 TEST & MEASUREMENT The Company’s Test & Measurement segment is a leading global provider of electronic measurement instruments, monitoring, management and optimization tools for communications networks and related services that are used in the design, development, manufacture, installation, deployment and operation of electronics equipment and communications networks and services. Customers for these products and services include manufacturers of electronic products, network equipment manufacturers who design, develop, manufacture and install network equipment, and service providers who implement, maintain and manage communications networks and services. Also included in the Test & Measurement segment are the Company’s mobile tool and wheel service businesses. 34 Table of Contents Test & Measurement Selected Financial Data ($ in millions) For the Year Ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 Sales $ 2,832.9 $ 2,221.3 $ 2,805.0 Operating profit 572.9 301.4 490.4 Depreciation and amortization 107.8 93.5 90.6 Restructuring and other related charges — 67.7 10.7 Operating profit as a % of sales 20.2 % 13.6 % 17.5 % Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales 3.8 % 4.2 % 3.2 % Restructuring and other related charges as a % of sales — 3.0 % 0.1 % Components of Sales Growth (Decline) 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Existing businesses 17.0 % (22.0 %) Acquisitions 10.5 % 2.0 % Currency exchange rates — (1.0 %) Total 27.5 % (21.0 %) 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 During 2010, demand increased significantly for the business’ core instruments, including oscilloscopes, thermography products and digital multi-meters. Sales were strong in all major geographies, with particular strength in China. In addition, distributor inventory reductions that occurred in the first three quarters of 2009 due to the recessionary economic conditions did not continue into 2010 which positively impacted the year-over-year comparisons. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s network and communication businesses grew at a low double-digit rate during 2010 on a year-over-year basis driven by strong demand for both network management solutions and core network enterprise solutions. Year-over-year price increases in the segment had a negligible impact on sales growth during 2010. Operating profit margins increased 660 basis points in 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase in operating profit margins during the period is primarily a result of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 as well as cost savings attributable to the Company’s 2009 restructuring activities. Year-over-year operating margin comparisons for 2010 also benefited from approximately 265 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010. Acquisition related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances (net of comparable acquisition related charges recorded in 2009) favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 55 basis points as such charges were greater in 2009 than in 2010. The dilutive effect of acquired businesses had a net adverse impact of 130 basis points on year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons, partially offsetting these favorable year-over-year factors. 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 Soft demand across all instrumentation related product lines, attributable to general economic conditions and inventory reductions by distributors, drove sales declines from existing businesses during 2009. Year-over-year price increases of 1.5% partially offset the sales decline during 2009. While year-over-year sales declined during each quarter during 2009, the rate of decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved compared to the first three quarters of the year primarily due to the adverse impact of inventory level reductions in the distribution channel that were largely completed by the end of the third quarter. Year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter were also 35 Table of Contents favorably impacted by the decline in demand that commenced in the fourth quarter 2008 resulting in an easier comparison. Sales declined in all significant geographic regions. Year-over-year sales in the network and communication businesses declined at a lower rate than the instrumentation business primarily as a result of positive performance in the network management solutions businesses which benefited from the competition among mobile telecommunication providers to expand coverage, services and performance of their networks. Operating profit margins decreased 390 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in operating profit margins resulted primarily from lower sales volumes during 2009, as well as 230 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 compared to 2008. The dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses also adversely impacted operating profit margins on a year-over-year basis by 35 basis points. Accounting charges incurred in 2008 associated with recording the fair value of inventory and deferred revenue acquired in connection with the November 2007 acquisition of Tektronix (net of comparable acquisition-related charges recorded in 2009) favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 120 basis points. Cost savings realized in 2009 attributable to the Company’s 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses also partially offset the reductions in operating profit margins. ENVIRONMENTAL The Company’s Environmental segment provides products that help protect our water supply and air quality and serves two primary markets: water quality and retail/commercial petroleum. Danaher’s water quality business is a global leader in water quality analysis and treatment, providing instrumentation and disinfection systems to help analyze and manage the quality of ultra pure, potable, and waste water in residential, commercial and industrial applications. Danaher’s retail/commercial petroleum business is a leading worldwide provider of products and services for the retail/commercial petroleum market. Environmental Selected Financial Data ($ in millions) For the Year Ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 Sales $ 2,738.0 $ 2,418.7 $ 2,413.2 Operating profit 564.3 471.0 477.3 Depreciation and amortization 45.9 43.1 41.5 Restructuring and other related charges — 31.7 18.9 Operating profit as a % of sales 20.6 % 19.5 % 19.8 % Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales 1.7 % 1.8 % 1.7 % Restructuring and other related charges as a % of sales — 1.3 % 0.1 % Components of Sales Growth (Decline) 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Existing businesses 10.5 % (1.0 %) Acquisitions 3.0 % 3.5 % Currency exchange rates (0.5 %) (2.5 %) Total 13.0 % — 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 Sales grew during 2010 as compared to 2009 in both the water quality and retail petroleum equipment businesses. Price increases in the segment contributed 0.5% to sales growth during 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses. 36 Table of Contents Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s water quality businesses grew at a low double-digit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009. Demand for the businesses’ laboratory and process instrumentation product lines was led by industrial markets and was stronger in all major geographies as compared to 2009. Sales in the business’ ultraviolet water treatment product line grew at a high-single digit rate during 2010. Solid year-over-year growth in the product line’s industrial and residential applications was partially offset by a difficult prior year comparison associated with a significant drinking water treatment project that favorably impacted revenues throughout 2009 and into the first half of 2010. Despite the difficult year-over-year comparison, underlying demand in the product line’s municipal markets remains robust. Sales in the business’ chemical treatment solutions product line also grew during 2010 as compared to 2009 due, in part, to continuing expansion of the chemical treatment solutions product line outside of the US market. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s retail petroleum equipment businesses grew at a low double-digit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009. Strong North American demand during 2010 for the business’ payment and point-of-sale retail solutions products was driven by enhanced industry standards deadlines and contributed significantly to the year-over-year sales growth. Demand for dispensing equipment also increased in all major geographic regions due to an increase in capital spending by customers. The business’ growth rate is expected to moderate in 2011 compared to 2010 as North American demand for payment and point-of-sale products is expected to moderate following the 2010 deadlines referenced above. Sales declines in the business’ vapor recovery product offerings in North America, primarily due to regulatory compliance deadlines in 2009 compared to 2010, partially offset these increases. Operating profit margins increased 110 basis points in 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase in operating profit margins during the period is primarily a result of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 as well as cost savings attributable to the Company’s 2009 restructuring activities. Year-over-year operating margin comparisons for 2010 also benefited from approximately 100 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010. The dilutive effect of acquired businesses had a net adverse impact of 55 basis points on year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons, partially offsetting these favorable year-over-year factors. Incremental year-over-year investments in 2010 associated with the segment’s emerging market growth initiatives also negatively impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 Sales in the water quality businesses during 2009 were essentially flat on a year-over-year basis while sales in the retail petroleum equipment businesses declined as compared to 2008. Price increases in the segment contributed 1.5% to sales growth during 2009 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s water quality businesses during 2009 were essentially flat as compared to 2008. A mid-teens growth rate in the business’ ultraviolet water treatment product line and a mid-single digit growth rate in the chemical treatment solutions product line along with year-over-year price increases of 2.0% offset low-single digit sales declines in the business’ laboratory and process instrumentation product line. Growth rates in the ultraviolet water treatment product line reflected strength in demand for municipal wastewater applications, as well as shipments related to a significant drinking water treatment plant project that commenced in 2009. In the business’ laboratory and process instrumentation and consumable product line, general economic conditions adversely impacted demand in all major geographies with the exception of China, where revenues grew at a low double-digit rate during 2009. Sales from existing businesses in the retail petroleum equipment business during 2009 declined at a low-single digit rate as compared to 2008. Strong North American sales of the business’ point-of-sale retail and payment solution product offerings that were driven in part by regulatory requirements were more than offset by lower demand for dispensing equipment, primarily in Europe, and service offerings. Lower demand for the business’ automatic tank gauge product offerings and leak detection systems also adversely impacted year-over-year comparisons. The decline in demand for the business’ leak detection systems was partially attributable to a significant project in 2008 that did not repeat in 2009. Operating profit margins decreased 30 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in operating profit margins resulted primarily from lower sales volumes from existing businesses during 2009, as well as 45 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 compared to 2008. The dilutive effect of recently acquired 37 Table of Contents businesses also adversely impacted operating profit margins on a year-over-year basis by 50 basis points. Cost savings realized in 2009 attributable to the Company’s 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses partially offset the reductions in operating profit margins. LIFE SCIENCES & DIAGNOSTICS The Company’s life sciences businesses offer a broad range of research and clinical tools that are used by scientists to study cells, and the components of cells, to gain a better understanding of complex biological matters. The Company’s diagnostics businesses offer a broad range of analytical instruments, reagents, consumables, software and services that are used to diagnose disease, make treatment decisions and monitor patients in hospitals and other critical care settings. Life Sciences & Diagnostics Selected Financial Data ($ in millions) For the Year Ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 Sales $ 2,298.3 $ 1,484.9 $ 1,481.5 Operating profit 227.9 179.6 193.2 Depreciation and amortization 90.7 56.6 53.7 Restructuring and other related charges — 16.7 6.6 Operating profit as a % of sales 9.9 % 12.1 % 13.0 % Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales 3.9 % 3.8 % 3.6 % Restructuring and other related charges as a % of sales — 1.1 % 0.1 % Components of Sales Growth (Decline) 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Existing businesses 9.0 % (1.0 %) Acquisitions 46.0 % 3.5 % Currency exchange rates — (2.5 %) Total 55.0 % — 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 During 2010, sales from existing businesses grew in each of the segment’s businesses. Sales growth from acquisitions was primarily attributable to the acquisition of AB/Sciex and Molecular Devices in January 2010. Year-over-year price increases in the segment had a negligible impact on sales growth during 2010. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s acute care diagnostics business grew at a high single-digit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 due primarily to strong demand in all major geographies for a new version of the business’ compact blood gas analyzer. Increased European demand for the business’ cardiac care instruments as well as continued strong consumable sales related to the business’ installed base of acute care diagnostic instrumentation also contributed to year-over-year sales growth. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s life sciences instrumentation and pathology diagnostics businesses grew at a high single-digit rate during 2010 as compared 2009. Year-over-year growth was driven primarily by strong demand in all major geographies for new instruments and consumables in the pathology diagnostics business. Increased sales of compound and stereo microscopy equipment serving the life sciences research and industrial markets also contributed to the growth. Japanese economic stimulus funding also positively impacted 2010 sales as purchases were required to be completed by March 2010 in order to be eligible for Japanese stimulus funding. 38 Table of Contents Operating profit margins decreased 220 basis points during 2010 as compared to 2009. Acquisition related charges during 2010 associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances, primarily related to the AB Sciex and Molecular Devices acquisitions, as well as 2010 transaction costs deemed significant by the Company (in each case net of comparable acquisition related charges and costs recorded in the comparable period of 2009) adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 270 basis points as such charges and costs were greater in 2010 than in 2009. The dilutive effect of acquired businesses had a net adverse impact of 265 basis points on year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. The favorable impact of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009, cost savings attributable to the Company’s 2009 restructuring activities and 50 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010 partially offset these adverse impacts. 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 During 2009, sales growth in the segment’s acute care diagnostic and pathology diagnostic businesses was largely offset by sales declines in the segment’s life sciences instrumentation businesses. Price increases contributed 1.5% sales growth during 2009 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses. Sales from existing businesses in the acute care diagnostics business grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008. Continued strong aftermarket consumables sales related to the business’ installed base of acute care diagnostic instrumentation drove the majority of the growth during 2009. Increased sales of the business’ cardiac marking instrument also contributed to the year-over-year growth. Sales grew at a double-digit rate in China and the emerging economies of Latin America during 2009, while combined Europe and North America sales were flat. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s life science instrumentation and pathology diagnostics businesses declined at a low-single digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008. Sales growth attributable to pathology diagnostic instrumentation and associated consumable products, primarily outside of North America, was more than offset by sales declines attributable to lower demand for compound and stereo microscopy equipment primarily in Europe and North America. Lower demand for microscopy equipment resulted largely from lower capital spending in the Company’s customer base throughout 2009. While year-over-year sales in the life sciences instrumentation business declined in each quarter during 2009, the rate of year-over-year decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved compared to the first three quarters of the year as economic stimulus funding, primarily in Japan, began to favorably impact the business. Operating profit margins declined 90 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008. Restructuring costs incurred during 2009 in excess of the levels incurred during 2008 reduced operating profit margins by 65 basis points on a year-over-year basis and the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses adversely impacted operating profit margin comparisons by 5 basis points. The impact of the new business combination accounting standard, requiring the expensing of transaction costs for pending and completed acquisitions after December 31, 2008, also reduced operating profit margins for 2009 by 100 basis points. While the year-over-year sales declines diminished leverage of the segment’s fixed cost base, the 2009 cost savings attributable to the Company’s 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses offset this adverse impact. DENTAL The Company’s Dental segment is a leading worldwide provider of a broad range of equipment and consumables for the dental market, focused on developing, manufacturing and marketing innovative solutions for dental professionals around the world. 39 Table of Contents Dental Selected Financial Data ($ in millions) For the Year Ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 Sales $ 1,824.6 $ 1,657.0 $ 1,795.5 Operating profit before Align gain 203.3 130.8 177.3 Impact of Align gain — 85.1 — Total operating profit 203.3 215.9 177.3 Depreciation and amortization 81.7 71.3 69.8 Restructuring and other related charges — 43.8 19.5 Operating profit as a % of sales 11.1 % 13.0 % 9.9 % Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales 4.5 % 4.3 % 3.9 % Restructuring and other related charges as a % of sales — 2.6 % 1.1 % Components of Sales Growth (Decline) 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Existing businesses 4.5 % (8.5 %) Acquisitions 6.5 % 3.0 % Currency exchange rates (1.0 %) (2.0 %) Total 10.0 % (7.5 %) 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 Price increases throughout the segment contributed 0.5% to sales growth during 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s dental technologies businesses grew at a low double-digit rate and increased in all major product categories during 2010 as compared to 2009. Growth was led by increased sales in the imaging product lines as a result of strong demand for 3D equipment and a recently introduced digital x-ray sensor. Year-over-year demand also increased for the business’ instruments and treatment units. Imaging product sales were particularly strong in North America and Asia, while instrument and treatment unit sales were particularly strong in Europe. Sales from existing businesses in the dental consumables businesses were essentially flat in 2010 as compared to 2009. Robust demand for orthodontia products throughout 2010 in addition to increased sales of infection control products were offset by weak demand for general dentistry consumables (primarily during the first three quarters of 2010) primarily as a result of adjustments to inventory levels in distribution channels that occurred during those periods. Demand in the general dentistry consumable businesses increased sequentially in the fourth quarter 2010 as inventories in the distribution channels returned to more normalized levels. Operating profit margins decreased 190 basis points during 2010 as compared to 2009. The decrease in operating profit margins is largely due to the favorable settlement of litigation with Align Technologies that occurred in 2009 and adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 515 basis points. The dilutive effect of acquired businesses had a net adverse impact of 10 basis points on year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. The favorable impact of higher sales volumes during 2010 compared to 2009, cost savings attributable to the Company’s 2009 restructuring activities and 145 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010 partially offset these adverse impacts. 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 Price increases contributed 1.0% sales growth during 2009 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses. 40 Table of Contents Sales from existing businesses in the dental consumables business in 2009 were essentially flat as compared to 2008. Increased sales of orthodontia and infection control products during 2009 were offset by weaker demand for implants, endodontic products and general dentistry consumables. Lower capital spending by customers and inventory reductions in certain distribution channels drove year-over-year sales declines at a mid-teen rate in the dental technologies businesses. While year-over-year sales in the dental technologies business declined in each quarter during 2009, the rate of year-over-year decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved compared to the first three quarters of the year due to strong sales of treatment units in Europe, as well as easier year-over-year comparisons due to a large stocking order for imaging equipment that occurred in the third quarter 2008. Operating profit margins increased 310 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008. The gain recognized during 2009 in connection with the Align litigation settlement favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 515 basis points. Restructuring costs incurred during 2009 in excess of the levels incurred during 2008 reduced operating profit margins by 140 basis points on a year-over-year basis and the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses adversely impacted operating profit margin comparisons by 20 basis points. The impact of the new business combination accounting standard, requiring the expensing of transaction costs for pending and completed acquisitions after December 31, 2008, also reduced operating profit margins for 2009 by 20 basis points. While the year-over-year sales declines diminished leverage of the segment’s fixed cost base, the 2009 cost savings attributable to the Company’s 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses partially offset this adverse impact. INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES The Company’s Industrial Technologies segment manufactures products and sub-systems that are typically incorporated by customers and systems integrators into production and packaging lines, as well as incorporated by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) into various end-products. Many of the businesses also provide services to support their products, including helping customers integrate and install the products and helping ensure product uptime. The Industrial Technologies segment consists of two strategic lines of business, product identification and motion, as well as the sensors and controls, aerospace and defense and engine retarder businesses. Industrial Technologies Segment Selected Financial Data ($ in millions) For the Year Ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 Sales $ 3,193.2 $ 2,795.1 $ 3,471.0 Operating profit 630.1 400.2 551.1 Depreciation and amortization 60.3 61.3 68.4 Restructuring and other related charges — 61.5 24.0 Operating profit as a % of sales 19.7 % 14.3 % 15.9 % Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales 1.9 % 2.2 % 2.0 % Restructuring and other related charges as a % of sales — 2.2 % 0.1 % Components of Sales Growth (Decline) 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Existing businesses 13.5 % (17.0 %) Acquisitions 0.5 % 0.5 % Currency exchange rates — (3.0 %) Total 14.0 % (19.5 %) 41 Table of Contents 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 Price increases throughout the segment contributed 1.5% to sales growth during 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s product identification businesses grew at a mid-teens rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to increased demand for core marking and coding equipment as customers released capital spending that had been delayed from prior years. Strong consumable sales associated with the installed base of marking and coding equipment also contributed to year-over-year growth. Sales grew in all major geographies with particular strength in Europe and the emerging markets. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s motion businesses grew at a double-digit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 as demand was strong in the majority of end markets served due primarily to the general economic recovery. While growth was generally broad-based, industrial automation led the growth with strong sales of advanced motor and drive product offerings. Sales increased in all major geographies. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s other businesses grew collectively at a high-single digit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 due to generally higher demand in most major end-markets. Demand increased in the segment’s sensors and controls businesses and engine-retarder business during 2010. Sales in the aerospace and defense businesses were essentially flat compared to 2009 as the aerospace end markets did not begin to recover from the recession until the second half of 2010. Operating profit margins increased 540 basis points during 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase in operating profit margins reflects the impact of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 as well as cost savings attributable to the Company’s 2009 restructuring activities. Year-over-year operating margin comparisons for 2010 also benefited from approximately 175 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010. The divestiture of certain lower margin businesses and product lines in the fourth quarter 2009 in connection with the Company’s restructuring activities also favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 40 basis points. 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 Sales declines in a majority of the segment’s businesses during 2009 more than offset sales growth of approximately 1.5% related to price increases which are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s product identification businesses declined at a high single digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008. Sales declines during 2009 resulted primarily from weak demand for core marking and coding equipment due to lower capital spending by customers as a result of general economic conditions. Sales of consumable products associated with the businesses’ installed base of marking and coding equipment also declined on a year-over-year basis but not as significantly as equipment sales. During the fourth quarter of 2009, equipment sales increased on a year-over-year basis primarily due to emerging market growth. Flat consumable product sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 were an improvement compared to year-over-year consumable sales declines during the first three quarters of the year. Sales in the China market grew during the second half of 2009, resulting in low-single digit sales growth for the full year. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s motion businesses declined at double digit rates during 2009 as compared to 2008. Sales declined as a result of weak demand for most of the businesses’ product offerings attributable to the recessionary economic conditions that existed throughout 2009. While year-over-year sales in the motion businesses declined in each quarter during 2009, the rate of year-over-year decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved slightly compared to the second and third quarters of the year, due to improvements in demand for certain product offerings and the absence of inventory reductions experienced in early 2009 in the business’ distribution channels. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s other businesses declined at a low-double digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008. The Company’s sensors and controls business saw modest improvement in certain end markets during the fourth quarter 2009 as compared to the first nine months of 2009. Demand in the Company’s aerospace and defense businesses softened in the second half of 2009, however, primarily due to declines in demand in the commercial aviation end markets. Continued capital project freezes by the United States Postal Service contributed to year-over-year sales declines in the business’ integrated scanning system product line. 42 Table of Contents Operating profit margins in the segment declined 160 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in operating profit margins resulted primarily from lower sales volumes during 2009, as well as 75 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 compared to 2008. The impact of the new business combination accounting standard, requiring the expensing of transaction costs for pending and completed acquisitions after December 31, 2008, combined with the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses, also reduced operating profit margins for 2009 by 10 basis points. Cost savings realized in 2009 attributable to the Company’s 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses partially offset these negative factors. GROSS PROFIT For the Year Ended December 31 ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Sales $ 13,202.6 $ 11,184.9 $ 12,697.5 Cost of sales 6,575.8 5,904.7 6,757.3 Gross profit 6,626.8 5,280.2 5,940.2 Gross profit margin 50.2 % 47.2 % 46.8 % Gross profit margins for 2010 increased 300 basis points from 2009. The year-over-year increase reflects the impact of higher sales volumes as compared to 2009, year-over-year cost savings attributable to the Company’s 2009 restructuring activities and 95 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 as compared to 2010. Gross profit margins during 2010 also benefited from the contribution to the Apex joint venture at the beginning of the third quarter of certain of the Company’s hand tools businesses that had lower average gross profit margins than the remainder of the Company. Acquisition related charges recorded in 2010 associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances in connection with the acquisition of AB Sciex, Molecular Devices and certain other acquisitions adversely impacted gross profit margin comparisons by approximately 30 basis points. Gross profit margins for 2009 increased 40 basis points from 2008. Cost savings related to 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities primarily drove the year-over-year improvements in gross profit margin from 2008 to 2009. Lower year-over-year commodity costs also contributed to the improvement, as costs for several types of raw materials increased sharply in 2008 before declining late in 2008 and into 2009. Lower overall sales volumes during 2009 as compared to 2008 diminished the leverage of the Company’s fixed cost base and partially offset these positive factors. In addition, costs incurred associated with year-over-year incremental 2009 restructuring activities adversely impacted gross profit margins by 65 basis points. OPERATING EXPENSES For the Year Ended December 31 ($ in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Sales $ 13,202.6 $ 11,184.9 $ 12,697.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 3,673.7 3,190.2 3,345.3 Research and development expenses 809.5 632.7 725.4 SG&A as a % of sales 27.8 % 28.5 % 26.3 % R&D as a % of sales 6.1 % 5.7 % 5.7 % The year-over-year decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2010 reflects the benefit of increased leverage of the Company’s cost base resulting from higher sales volumes during 2010 as compared to 2009 in addition to 65 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 as compared 43 Table of Contents to 2010. Incremental year-over-year investments in the Company’s sales growth initiatives, increased commission costs due to the higher sales volumes and the dilutive effect of certain recently acquired businesses and those businesses’ higher relative operating expense structures partially offset these year-over-year improvements. The year-over-year increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales from 2008 to 2009 is primarily due to reduced leverage of the Company’s cost base caused by lower sales volumes during 2009 as compared to 2008. Incremental year-over-year costs associated with 2009 restructuring activities adversely impacted selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis, although the 2008 and 2009 restructuring actions generated year-over-year cost savings that partially offset these negative factors. Research and development expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points during 2010 on a year-over-year basis. The increase is primarily attributable to the contribution of the Company’s hand tools businesses to the Apex joint venture, as the research and development spending of such businesses has historically been less than the Company average. Overall research and development costs also increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to recently acquired businesses, primarily AB Sciex and Molecular Devices, with higher average research and development expenditures as well as continued investment in the Company’s new product development initiatives. Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales were flat during 2009 as compared to 2008. The Company continued to invest in new product development within all of its businesses, with particular emphasis on the medical technologies, test and measurement, environmental and product identification businesses. EARNINGS FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE As previously discussed, in July, 2010 the Company closed on the formation of the Apex joint venture. As of the closing of the transaction, the Company deconsolidated its contributed businesses and commenced accounting for its investment in the joint venture based on the equity method of accounting. As a result of the Company’s continuing involvement with the joint venture, the contributed businesses are not presented as a discontinued operation. The equity in the earnings of Apex, reflecting the Company’s 50% ownership position subsequent to the formation, is reflected in the “Earnings from unconsolidated joint venture” caption in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The impact on the Company’s results of operations from (1) the contributed business prior to the formation of Apex, and (2) the Company’s equity in the earnings of Apex subsequent to the formation of Apex, is reflected in the table below ($ in millions): For the Year Ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 Prior to formation of Apex Sales $ 315.6 $ 607.9 $ 731.3 Operating profit 41.5 63.9 68.2 Subsequent to formation of Apex Earnings from unconsolidated joint venture 22.8 — — INTEREST EXPENSE AND INCOME For a description of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness, please refer to “–Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities and Indebtedness” below. Interest expense of $121 million in 2010 was essentially flat as compared to 2009. Interest expense of $123 million in 2009 was $7.5 million lower than 2008 primarily as a result of lower average debt levels during 2009 as the Company deployed cash flows to repay a portion of its commercial paper borrowings. Interest attributable to the $750 million principal amount of 5.40% senior unsecured notes issued in March 2009 partially offset the positive impact of the reduction in outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 44 Table of Contents The Company recognized interest income of $6 million, $5 million and $10 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Interest income in 2010 was higher than interest income in 2009 due to higher average invested cash balances. Interest income in 2009 was lower than interest income in 2008 as the lower interest rates on deposits in 2009 compared to 2008 more than offset higher average invested cash balances. INCOME TAXES General Income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the Company’s financial statements. The Company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur. The Company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in tax laws. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2010 differs from the United States federal statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of lower effective tax rates on certain earnings from operations outside of the United States. No provisions for United States income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States. The amount of United States income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the Company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings. As of December 31, 2010, the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately $6.5 billion. The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for contingent tax liabilities. Based on these reviews, the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the expiration of statutes of limitation, reserves are adjusted as necessary. For a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors”. Year-Over-Year Changes in Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate The Company’s effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was 23.5%, 19.2% and 24.7%, respectively. The Company’s 2010 effective tax rate of 23.5% reflects the benefit of earnings outside the United States taxed at rates lower than the U.S. Federal income tax rate. The 2010 effective tax rate includes the benefit of approximately 50 basis points ($11.5 million, or $0.02 per diluted share) of discrete tax reserve reductions associated with resolution of certain international and domestic tax positions and refinements of reserve estimates related to prior period tax contingencies. The Company’s tax provision was reduced by approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 as a result of the extension of the research and experimentation credit and other U.S. legislation enacted in December 2010 related to taxation of international earnings. The Company’s 2009 effective tax rate of 19.2% includes the impact of approximately 680 basis points ($97.2 million, or $0.15 per diluted share) related to gains from the net reduction of reserves associated with the resolution of uncertain tax positions and discrete items. The impact of expensing transaction costs (in accordance with the business combination accounting standard that became effective at the beginning of 2009), much of which are not deductible for income tax purposes, partially offset these beneficial factors. The effective tax rate for 2011 is expected to be approximately 25.5%. The anticipated increase from the 2010 rate is largely attributable to recent U.S. legislation effective as of the beginning of 2011 that repealed or modified certain tax provisions applicable to U.S. companies having international operations that enable the use of foreign tax credits to offset U.S. corporate income taxes. 45 Table of Contents INFLATION The effect of broad based inflation on the Company’s operations was not significant in the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, 2009 or 2008. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit risk, equity prices and commodity prices, each of which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. In addition, the Company’s broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole. Interest Rate Risk A change in interest rates on long-term debt impacts the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt but not our earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2010, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt (excluding the LYONs, which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from its underlying common stock) by approximately $105 million. However, since the Company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturity, the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt does not affect the Company’s results of operations or stockholders’ equity. As of December 31, 2010, the Company’s variable-rate debt obligations relate primarily to U.S. dollar commercial paper borrowings, and as a result its primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2010. As these obligations mature, the Company anticipates issuing additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. In 2010, a 100% increase in average market interest rates on the Company’s commercial paper borrowings would have increased the Company’s interest expense by approximately $0.4 million. A 100% hypothetical fluctuation is used as the Company’s actual commercial paper interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2010. Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries. The Eurobond Notes described below (which as of December 31, 2010 had outstanding borrowings in principal amount equivalent to $669 million) provide a natural hedge to a portion of the Company’s European net asset position. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the Company’s net investment in international subsidiaries, net of the translation effect of the Company’s Eurobond Notes, is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive income” component of stockholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in major currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2010 (net of the translation effect of the Company’s Eurobond Notes) would result in a reduction of stockholders’ equity of approximately $450 million. The Company also faces exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Although the Company has a U.S. dollar functional currency for reporting purposes, it has manufacturing sites throughout the world and a substantial portion of its costs are incurred, and sales are generated in foreign currencies. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the United States dollar. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. 46 Table of Contents Currency exchange rates decreased reported 2010 sales by 0.5% on a year-over-year basis as the U.S. dollar was, on average, slightly stronger against other major currencies during 2010 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2009. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar that began in the second quarter 2010 and prevailed throughout most of the remainder of 2010 more than offset the U.S. dollar’s weakness against other major currencies during the first quarter of 2010. If the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2010 prevail throughout 2011, currency exchange rates will positively impact 2011 reported sales by approximately 1.0% relative to the Company’s performance in 2010. Weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would have a further positive impact on the Company’s reported sales and results of operations. Any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would adversely impact the Company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Therefore, both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales, profit, and assets and liabilities in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, and trade accounts receivable. The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company places cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world, and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents. Our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds. In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to the diversity of the Company’s customers. The Company’s businesses perform ongoing credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions and typically obtain collateral or other security when appropriate. Equity Price Risk The Company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale investments due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the equity securities. A 10% decline in the value of these equity securities as of December 31, 2010 would have reduced the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio by approximately $26 million. Commodity Price Risk For a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices, please see “Item 1. Materials.” 47 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Management assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions and maintain its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. For a discussion of risks related to the uncertainty in the financial markets and the global economy in general, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity ($ in millions) For the Years Ended December 31 2010 2009 2008 Operating cash flows $ 2,084.4 $ 1,800.8 $ 1,859.0 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (217.3 ) (188.5 ) (193.8 ) Cash paid for acquisitions (2,129.7 ) (703.5 ) (423.2 ) Cash paid for other investments — (66.8 ) — Other sources 58.1 15.9 49.6 Net cash used in investing activities (2,288.9 ) (942.9 ) (567.4 ) Proceeds from the issuance of common stock 178.4 174.2 82.4 Debt repayments, net of new borrowings (excluding March 2009 public debt offering) (9.4 ) (469.9 ) (1,092.3 ) Proceeds of March 2009 public debt offering — 744.6 — Purchase of treasury stock — — (74.2 ) Payment of dividends (52.2 ) (41.7 ) (38.2 ) Net cash provided by / (used in) financing activities 116.8 407.2 (1,122.3 ) • Operating cash flow, a key source of the Company’s liquidity, increased $284 million, or approximately 16%, during 2010 as compared to 2009. • Funding for acquisitions constituted the most significant use of cash during 2010. The Company acquired 19 businesses during 2010. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was approximately $2.1 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. • The Company repaid approximately $9 million of debt (net of new borrowings) during 2010. • The Company’s restructuring activities used approximately $110 million in cash during 2010. • The Company contributed approximately $90 million in cash to the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan and approximately $33 million to the Company’s non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans during 2010. • As of December 31, 2010, the Company held $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents. 48 Table of Contents Operating Activities The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position, with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for items such as income taxes, restructuring activities, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows. Operating cash flow was approximately $2.1 billion for 2010, an increase of $284 million, or 16% as compared to 2009. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily attributable to the increase in earnings in 2010 as compared to 2009. Partially offsetting this benefit was an investment in trade accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable which in the aggregate used $204 million of cash flow during 2010 as compared to contributing $228 million of cash flow during 2009. The increased use of cash reflects increased inventory and accounts receivable levels, partially offset by increased accounts payable levels, associated with increased business activity. Operating cash flow was approximately $1.8 billion for 2009, a decrease of $58 million, or approximately 3% as compared to 2008. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily attributable to the decrease in earnings in 2009 as compared to 2008 and to a lesser extent attributable to the year-over-year incremental amount of cash paid related to the Company’s restructuring activities. In addition, the Company voluntarily contributed $60 million to the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2009 while it made no contribution in 2008. The declines in operating cash flow were partially offset by cash generated from the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable which contributed $228 million of cash flow during 2009 as compared to contributing $108 million of cash flow during 2008. Increased collections of accounts receivable and reduced inventory levels (partially offset by reductions in accounts payable) associated with lower levels of business activity benefited cash flow in 2009 as compared to 2008. A decline of approximately $100 million in tax payments during 2009 as compared to 2008 also partially offset the decline in operating cash flow. In connection with the Company’s restructuring activities, the Company records appropriate accruals for the costs of closing facilities, severing personnel and, in connection with acquisitions, integrating the acquired businesses into existing Company operations. Cash flows from operating activities are reduced by the amounts expended against the various accruals established in connection with these activities. During 2010, the Company paid approximately $110 million related to its 2009 restructuring activities. During 2009, the Company paid approximately $161 million related to its 2009 and 2008 restructuring activities and approximately $29 million related to restructuring activities associated with acquisitions completed prior to December 31, 2008. Please refer to Note 2 and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about these expenditures. Investing Activities Cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures and cash flows from divestitures of businesses or assets. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.3 billion during 2010 compared to $943 million of net cash used in 2009. Gross capital spending of $217 million during 2010 was approximately $29 million more than gross capital spending during 2009. Capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development and improving information technology systems. In 2011, the Company expects capital spending to approximate $250 million, though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $943 million in 2009 compared to approximately $567 in 2008. Gross capital spending of $194 million in 2009 decreased approximately $5 million from 2008 capital spending levels. As discussed below, the Company completed numerous business acquisitions and divestitures during 2010, 2009 and 2008. All of the acquisitions during this period have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Company’s financial statements. This goodwill typically arises because the purchase prices for these businesses reflect a number of factors including the future earnings and cash flow potential of these businesses; the multiple to earnings, cash flow and other factors at which similar businesses have been purchased by other acquirers; the competitive nature of the process by which the Company acquired the business; and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these businesses bring to existing operations. For a discussion of other factors resulting in the recognition of goodwill see Notes 2 and 6 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 49 Table of Contents 2010 Acquisitions and Apex Joint Venture For a discussion of the Company’s 2010 acquisitions and the 2010 formation of the Apex joint venture, please refer to “—Overview — Acquisitions; Joint Venture with Cooper Industries plc.” 2009 Acquisitions/Divestitures The Company acquired fifteen businesses during 2009 for consideration of approximately $704 million in cash, net of cash acquired. Each company acquired manufactures products and/or provides services in the life sciences, dental, product identification, environmental or test and measurement markets. These businesses were acquired to complement existing units of the Life Sciences & Diagnostics, Dental, Industrial Technologies, Environmental and Test & Measurement segments. The aggregate annual sales of these fifteen acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $430 million. In addition, during 2009 the Company divested five businesses or product lines for approximately $10 million of net cash proceeds. The divested businesses were part of the Industrial Technologies and the former Tools and Components segments and had aggregate annual revenues of approximately $53 million in 2009. The Company recorded no significant gain or loss, either individually or in the aggregate, associated with these divestitures. The Company used the proceeds from these sales for general corporate purposes. 2008 Acquisitions The Company acquired seventeen companies or product lines during 2008 for consideration of approximately $423 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired and $8 million of debt assumed. Each company acquired manufactures products and/or provides services in the life sciences, dental, product identification, environmental or test and measurement markets. These companies were acquired to complement existing units of the Life Sciences & Diagnostics, Dental, Industrial Technologies, Environmental and Test & Measurement segments. The aggregate annual sales of these seventeen acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $325 million. Financing Activities and Indebtedness Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper, common stock and notes, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, repayments of indebtedness, repurchases of common stock and payments of dividends to shareholders. Financing activities provided cash of $117 million during 2010 compared to $407 million of cash provided during 2009. The year-over-year change was primarily due to the proceeds from the issuance of the 2019 Notes (described below) during 2009 partially offset by lower repayments of borrowings during 2010 as compared to 2009. Total debt was $2.8 billion at December 31, 2010 compared to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2009. The Company’s debt as of December 31, 2010 was as follows: • $180 million of outstanding U.S. dollar denominated commercial paper; • $669 million (€500 million) aggregate principal amount of 4.5% guaranteed Eurobond Notes due 2013 (“Eurobond Notes”); • $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2018 (“2018 Notes”); • $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.4% Senior Notes due 2019 (“2019 Notes”); • $573 million of zero coupon Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2021 (“LYONs”); and • $152 million of other borrowings. 50 Table of Contents For additional details regarding the Company’s debt as of December 31, 2010, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt, except in connection with the change of control provisions described as follows. Under each of the Eurobond Notes, the 2018 Notes and the 2019 Notes, if the Company experiences a change of control and a rating downgrade of a specified nature within a specified period following the change of control, the Company will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of the 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes, or the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of Eurobond Notes. The Company’s outstanding indentures and comparable instruments also contain customary covenants including, for example, limits on the incurrence of secured debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to the Company’s operations and as of December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants. For a discussion of the risks related to our indebtedness, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Commercial Paper Program and Credit Facility The Company satisfies its short-term liquidity needs primarily through issuances of U.S. dollar and Euro denominated commercial paper. Under the Company’s U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper programs, the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes in aggregate principal amount not to exceed $4.0 billion. Since the Credit Facilities (described below) provide credit support for the program, the $1.525 billion of availability under the Credit Facilities has the practical effect of reducing from $4.0 billion to $1.525 billion the maximum amount of commercial paper that the Company can issue under the program. Borrowings under the program are available for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The Company classifies the borrowings under the commercial paper program as long-term borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company has the intent and the ability, as supported by the availability of the Credit Facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date. Credit support for the commercial paper program is provided by an unsecured $1.45 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with a syndicate of banks that expires on April 25, 2012 and an unsecured $75 million multicurrency revolving credit facility that expires on May 3, 2011 (the “Supplemental Credit Facility” and together with the Credit Facility, the “Credit Facilities”). The Credit Facilities can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Under the Credit Facility, interest is based on, at the Company’s option (1) a LIBOR-based formula that is dependent in part on the Company’s credit rating, (2) a formula based on the higher (as of the date of determination) of Bank of America’s prime rate or the Federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, or (3) the rate of interest bid by a particular lender for a particular loan under the facility. Under the Supplemental Credit Facility, interest is based on, at the Company’s option (1) a LIBOR-based formula, or (2) a formula based on the highest (as of the date of determination) of the lender’s prime rate, the Federal funds rate plus 50 basis points or the LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points. Both of the Credit Facilities require the Company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus stockholders’ equity) as of the last day of each quarter of 0.65 to 1.00 or less. As of December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with this covenant. The availability of the Credit Facilities as standby liquidity facilities to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of our commercial paper program. We expect to limit any borrowings under the Credit Facilities to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facilities so that we could borrow, if needed, to repay all of our outstanding commercial paper as it matures. The Company anticipates seeking a renewal of the term of the Supplemental Credit Facility from the lender prior to its scheduled expiration. During 2010, the Company refinanced balances under its commercial paper program as they came due to maintain an outstanding balance throughout the year. Amounts outstanding under the Company’s U.S. dollar commercial paper program as of December 31, 2010 had a weighted average interest rate of 0.25% and a weighted average maturity of approximately 11 days. The Company had no outstanding Euro denominated commercial paper as of December 31, 2010. Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related costs of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Any downgrade in the Company’s credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the Company’s commercial paper program and Credit Facility, and could limit or preclude the Company’s ability to issue commercial paper. If our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash, operating cash flow and our Credit Facilities to provide short-term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under our Credit Facilities could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings. 51 Table of Contents In addition to the Credit Facilities, the Company has entered into reimbursement agreements with various commercial banks to support the issuance of letters of credit. Other Long-Term Indebtedness In March 2009, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due 2019. The notes were issued at 99.93% of their principal amount. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, were approximately $745 million. A portion of the net proceeds were used to repay a portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial paper with the balance of the net proceeds used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The Company may redeem the notes at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest plus 40 basis points. In December 2007, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2018. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, were approximately $493.4 million, which were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance the acquisition of Tektronix. The Company may redeem the notes at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest plus 25 basis points. On July 21, 2006, a financing subsidiary of the Company issued the Eurobond Notes in a private placement outside the U.S. Payment obligations under these Eurobond Notes are guaranteed by the Company. The net proceeds of the offering, after the deduction of underwriting commissions but prior to the deduction of other issuance costs, were €496 million ($627 million based on exchange rates in effect at the time the offering closed) and were used to pay down a portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The Company may redeem the notes upon the occurrence of specified, adverse changes in tax laws, or interpretations under such laws, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed. In 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in LYONs. The net proceeds to the Company were $505 million, of which approximately $100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The LYONs carry a yield to maturity of 2.375% (with contingent interest payable as described below). Holders of the LYONs may convert each $1,000 of principal amount at maturity into 29.0704 shares of Danaher common stock (in the aggregate for all LYONs that were originally issued, approximately 24.0 million shares of Danaher common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January 22, 2021. As of December 31, 2010, an aggregate of approximately 2.4 million shares of Danaher common stock had been issued upon conversion of LYONs. From January 1, 2011 through February 11, 2011, holders of certain of the Company’s Liquid Yield Option Notes (LYONs) converted such LYONs into an aggregate of approximately 5.2 million shares of Danaher common stock, par value $0.01 per share. As of December 31, 2010, the accreted value of the outstanding LYONs was lower than the traded market value of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time at scheduled redemption prices. Holders had the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash and/or Company common stock, at the Company’s option, on January 22, 2011, which resulted in notes with an accreted value of approximately $13 thousand being redeemed by the Company for cash. The holders had a similar option to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes as of January 22, 2004, which resulted in notes with an accreted value of $1.1 million being redeemed by the Company for cash. Under the terms of the LYONs, the Company will pay contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six month period from January 23 to July 22 and from July 23 to January 22 if the average market price of a LYON for a specified measurement period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. The amount of contingent interest to be paid with respect to any quarterly period is equal to the higher of either 0.0315% of the bonds’ average market price during the specified measurement period or the amount of the common stock dividend paid during such quarterly period multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon conversion of a LYON. The Company paid approximately $2.1 million of contingent interest on the LYONs for the year ended December 31, 2010. Except for the contingent interest described above, the Company will not pay interest on the LYONs prior to maturity. 52 Table of Contents Shelf Registration Statement The Company has a “well-known seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance. The Company expects to use the net proceeds from future securities sales off this shelf for general corporate purposes. These purposes may include, but are not limited to, reduction or refinancing of debt or other corporate obligations; acquisitions; capital expenditures; share repurchases and dividends; and working capital. Stock Repurchase Program On May 11, 2010, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20 million shares of the Company’s common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions (which repurchase program replaces the repurchase program that was authorized by the Board in April 2005). There is no expiration date for the Company’s repurchase program. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by the Company’s management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Company’s equity compensation plans (or any successor plans) and for other corporate purposes. The Company did not repurchase any shares of Company common stock during 2010 or 2009. During 2008, the Company repurchased 2.76 million shares of Company common stock in open market transactions at a cost of $74 million, under the Company’s prior stock repurchase program. The 2008 repurchases were funded from available cash and from proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. As of December 31, 2010, 20 million shares remain available for repurchase pursuant to this program. The Company expects to fund any further repurchases using the Company’s available cash balances or proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. Dividends The Company declared a regular dividend of $0.02 per share that was paid on January 28, 2011 to holders of record on December 31, 2010. Aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2010 were approximately $52 million. Cash and Cash Requirements The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures and acquisitions, to pay interest and service debt, fund its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, pay dividends to shareholders and repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, particularly in connection with acquisitions, the Company may also borrow under its existing commercial paper programs or the Credit Facilities, enter into new credit facilities in order to expand borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program and issue commercial paper in amounts in excess of the program’s current capacity and/or access the capital markets as needed for liquidity. We also may from time to time access the capital markets to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions. As of December 31, 2010, the Company held $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an average weighted annual interest rate of 0.4%. The Company’s cash balances are generated and held in numerous locations throughout the world. At December 31, 2010, approximately $1.4 billion of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents was held outside the United States. Most of the cash balances held outside the United States could be repatriated to the United States although under current law would potentially be subject to United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. The Company utilizes a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that its worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. Wherever possible, intra-company financing is used to provide working capital to the Company’s operations. 53 Table of Contents During 2010, the Company contributed $90 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan and approximately $33 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2011, the Company’s cash contribution requirements are expected to be approximately $50 million for its U.S. plan, although the ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan’s funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates and other factors. The Company expects to contribute approximately $27 million in employer contributions and unfunded benefit payments to the non-U.S. defined benefit plans in 2011. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 under (1) long-term debt obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company’s balance sheet under GAAP. The amounts presented in the table below do not reflect $389 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits. Total LessThanOneYear 1-3 Years 3-5Years MoreThan5 Years ($ in millions) Debt & Leases: Long-Term Debt Obligations (a)(b) $ 2,799.2 $ 38.3 $ 915.5 $ 4.2 $ 1,825.4 Capital Lease Obligations (b) 25.5 2.5 8.0 7.2 23.6 Total Long-Term Debt 2,824.7 40.8 923.5 11.4 1,849.0 Interest Payments on Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations (c) 833.3 106.3 207.6 145.6 373.8 Operating Lease Obligations (d) 463.8 124.8 165.7 94.3 79.0 Other: Purchase Obligations (e) 654.9 535.7 67.2 2.8 49.2 Other Long-Term Liabilities Reflected on the Company’s Balance Sheet Under GAAP (f) 1,845.6 — 574.7 398.1 872.8 Total $ 6,622.3 $ 807.6 $ 1,938.7 $ 652.2 $ 3,223.8 (a) As described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (b) Amounts do not include interest payments. Interest on long-term debt and capital lease obligations is reflected in a separate line in the table. (c) Interest payments on long-term debt are projected for future periods using the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2010. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates. (d) As described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain leases require us to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises. These future costs are not included in the schedule above. (e) Consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. (f) Primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies and allowances, performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs, self-insurance and litigation claims, post-retirement benefits, certain pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities (excluding unrecognized tax benefits) and deferred compensation obligations. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management’s estimates over the terms of these arrangements and is largely based upon historical experience. 54 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of off-balance sheet commercial commitments of the Company as of December 31, 2010. Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period ($ in millions) TotalAmountsCommitted LessThanOneYear 1-3Years 4-5Years MoreThan5Years Standby Letters of Credit and Performance Bonds $ 305.2 $ 88.4 $ 164.8 $ 29.9 $ 22.1 Guarantees 68.7 30.3 10.7 2.0 25.7 Total $ 373.9 $ 118.7 $ 175.5 $ 31.9 $ 47.8 Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are generally issued to secure the Company’s obligations under short-term contracts to purchase raw materials and components and for performance under specific sales agreements. Guarantees are generally issued in connection with certain transactions with vendors, suppliers, and financing counterparties and governmental entities. Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters or tax matters. The Company has not included any such items in the table above because they relate to unknown conditions and the Company cannot estimate the potential liabilities from such matters, but the Company does not believe that any such liability will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. In addition, as a result of these divestitures, as well as restructuring activities, certain properties leased by the Company have been sublet to third parties. In the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by such sub-lessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. In the normal course of business, the Company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers, suppliers or other business partners for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the Company’s products or claims alleging that Company products infringe third-party intellectual property. The Company cannot estimate its maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions and has not accrued any liabilities in its consolidated financial statements or included any indemnification provisions in our contractual commitments table above. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations. The Company’s Certificate of Incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the Company, or by reason of serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to limited exceptions. Danaher’s Amended and Restated By-laws provide for similar indemnification rights. In addition, Danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of Danaher Corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which Danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding. While the Company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage. Legal Proceedings Please refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding certain litigation matters. 55 Table of Contents In addition to the litigation matters noted under “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters – Environmental, Health & Safety” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings,” the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Company’s products and services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, personal injury and insurance coverage. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, divested businesses. Some of these lawsuits may include claims for punitive and consequential, as well as compensatory damages. Based upon the Company’s experience, current information and applicable law, it does not believe that these proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on its cash flows, financial position or results of operations. While the Company maintains general, products, property, workers’ compensation, automobile, cargo, aviation, crime, fiduciary and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (and has acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions) up to certain limits that cover a portion of these claims, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses. For general and products liability and most other insured risks, the Company purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses (“stop loss” insurance) and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to amounts within the self-insured retention. In addition, while the Company believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims, these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses. The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company periodically assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes for these matters, as well as amounts or ranges of probable losses, and if appropriate recognizes a reserve for these contingencies. These reserves consist of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts for anticipated developments of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims. The specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified with the assistance of legal counsel and outside risk insurance professionals where appropriate. In addition, outside risk insurance professionals assist in the determination of reserves for incurred but not yet reported claims through evaluation of the Company’s specific loss history, actual claims reported, and industry trends among statistical and other factors. Reserve estimates are adjusted as additional information regarding a claim becomes known. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including litigation developments, the discovery of new facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. While the Company actively pursues financial recoveries from insurance providers, it does not recognize any recoveries until realized or until such time as a sustained pattern of collections is established related to historical matters of a similar nature and magnitude. The Company believes the liability recorded for such contingencies as of December 31, 2010 is adequate, but due to judgments inherent in the reserve process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate. If the Company’s self-insurance and litigation reserves prove inadequate, it would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s net earnings. Please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the amount of our accruals for self-insurance and litigation liability. For a discussion of additional risks related to existing and potential legal proceedings, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” 56 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments. The Company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made, and (2) material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely from period to period. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to Note 1 in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounts receivable. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect probable credit losses inherent in its portfolio of receivables. Determination of the allowances requires management to exercise judgment about the timing, frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for credit losses and, therefore, net income. The allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s best estimate of the credit losses expected from the Company’s trade accounts, contract and finance receivable portfolios based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience. The level of the allowances is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors including historical loss experience by receivable type, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic conditions and credit risk quality. The Company regularly performs detailed reviews of its accounts receivable portfolio to determine if an impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowances. Additions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are charged to current period earnings; amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowances, while amounts recovered on previously written-off accounts increase the allowances. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional reserves would be required. Inventories. The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market value. The Company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand, technological advances and pricing competition in many of the Company’s markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the Company’s control. As a result, such fluctuations can be difficult to predict. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, the Company could be required to reduce the value of its inventory, which would adversely impact the Company’s net earnings and financial condition. Acquired intangibles. The Company’s business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the Company may incur. The Company does not amortize goodwill but does amortize certain identifiable intangible assets, primarily customer relationships and acquired technology, over the estimated useful life of the identified asset. On an annual basis (the first day of the Company’s fiscal fourth quarter) the Company estimates the fair value of each of its reporting units and compares the fair value of each unit to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company must perform additional analysis to determine if the reporting unit’s goodwill has been impaired. If circumstances or events prior to the date of the required annual assessment indicate that, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that there has been diminution of fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value, the Company performs an impairment analysis at the time of such circumstance or event. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market based approach. The Company estimates fair value based on EBITDA multiples determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the Company’s reporting units in addition to market available precedent transactions of comparable businesses. In evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach, management assesses the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data. The Company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (i.e., an income approach) in order to validate the results of the market approach in certain circumstances. Once completed, the results of the income and market approaches are reconciled and compared. The 57 Table of Contents discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. While the Company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units, if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had 27 reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. The carrying value of the goodwill included in each individual reporting unit ranges from approximately $6.6 million to approximately $2.1 billion. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2010 indicated that in all instances, the fair value of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 16% to approximately 617%. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this hypothetical 10% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units ranged from approximately 4% to approximately 545%. Contingent Liabilities. As discussed above under “—Legal Proceedings”, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors, including those discussed above under “—Legal Proceedings”. If the reserves established by the Company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s net earnings. Revenue Recognition: The Company derives revenues from the sale of products and services. For revenue related to a product or service to qualify for recognition, there must be persuasive evidence of a sale, delivery must have occurred or the services must have been rendered, the price to the customer must be fixed and determinable and collectibility of the balance must be reasonably assured. See Note 1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s revenue recognition policies. Although most of the sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, certain agreements contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. As a result, judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for sales recognition purposes, and, if so, how the sales price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize sales for each element. For delivered elements, sales are recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value, fair values of undelivered elements are known, there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance and there are no customer-negotiated refund or return rights affecting the sales recognized for delivered elements. Share-Based Compensation: The Company accounts for share-based compensation by measuring the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted, including stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted shares, based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date. For a discussion of the Company’s share-based compensation accounting practices, please see Note 16 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the awards and stock price volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management’s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company uses different assumptions, the Company’s equity-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. If the Company’s actual forfeiture rate during a reporting period is materially different than its estimate, the Company’s earnings may be significantly impacted as the Company records the effect of actual experience in the period it occurs. 58 Table of Contents Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits: Certain of the Company’s employees and retired employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans (pension plans) and certain eligible retirees are entitled to health care and life insurance benefits under postretirement benefit plans (postretirement plans). The Company measures its pension and post retirement plans’ assets and obligations as of the end of each year to determine the funded status of each plan. The Company recognizes an asset for a plan’s overfunded status or a liability for a plan’s underfunded status in its statement of financial position. Changes in the funded status of the plans are recognized in the year in which the changes occur and are reported in comprehensive income. Accounting standards require that the amounts the Company records, including the expense or income, associated with the pension and postretirement plans be computed using actuarial valuations. Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations, including assumptions regarding discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate, changes in the assumptions (as a result of differences in actual experience, changes in key economic indicators or other factors) may affect the Company’s financial position or results of operations. For the U.S. plan, the Company used a 5.2% discount rate in computing the amount of the minimum pension liability to be recorded at December 31, 2010, which represents a decrease of 55 basis points in the discount rate from December 31, 2009. For non-U.S. plans, rates appropriate for each plan are determined based on investment grade instruments with maturities approximately equal to the average expected benefit payout under the plan. A 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate used for the plans would have increased the U.S. and non-U.S. net obligation by $59 million ($40 million on an after tax basis) from the amount recorded in the financial statements at December 31, 2010. For 2010, the expected long-term rate of return assumption applicable to assets held in the U.S. plan has been estimated at 8%. This expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected long-term returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets. The U.S. plan targets to invest between 60% and 70% of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments. The balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in corporate bonds and bond index funds. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was reduced by 0.5%, pension expense for 2010 would have increased $5 million (or $3 million on an after-tax basis). The Company’s non-U.S. plan assets consist of various insurance contracts, equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan. The estimated long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 1.25% to 7.20% for 2010 and ranged from 0.75% to 8.0% for 2009. For a discussion of the Company’s 2010 and anticipated 2011 defined benefit pension plan contributions, please see “Liquidity and Capital Resources —Cash and Cash Requirements”. Income Taxes: The Company’s income tax expense represents the current tax liability for the year and the tax benefit or expense for the net change in deferred tax liabilities and assets during the year. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the Company’s tax return in future years for which the tax benefit has already been reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances. The determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies, and can also be impacted by changes to tax laws. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items that have already been taken as a deduction on the Company’s tax return but have not yet been recognized as an expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon the technical merits, it is “more-likely-than-not” that the position will be sustained upon examination. Judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions. The Company generally re-evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and recognizes an uncertain tax benefit when (i) there is completion of tax audit; (ii) there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (iii) there is an expiration of the statute of limitations. 59 Table of Contents An increase in our nominal tax rate of 1.0 percent would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 of approximately $23 million. New Accounting Standards In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13, “Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements.” This ASU establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenue-generating activities and provides amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables and measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting. The amendments also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. Significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendor’s multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements, including information about the nature and terms, significant deliverables, and its performance within arrangements. The amendments also require providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of the relative selling-price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition. Concurrent with the issuance of ASU No. 2009-13, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-14, “Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements.” This ASU changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements that are “essential to the functionality,” and scopes these products out of current software revenue guidance. The new guidance includes factors to help companies determine what software elements are considered “essential to the functionality.” The amendments will now subject software-enabled products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements, such as guidance surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. Effective January 1, 2011, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the provisions of these updated accounting standards related to revenue recognition associated with contractual arrangements involving multiple elements and contractual arrangements involving tangible products that include software. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the effect of adopting these standards on future financial periods as the impact will vary depending on the nature and volume of new or materially modified transactions in any given period.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For a discussion of risks related to our non-US operations and foreign currency exchange, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Major Customers No customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated sales in 2011, 2010 or 2009. Available Information We maintain an internet website at www.danaher.com. We make available free of charge on the website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material with, or furnishing such material to, the SEC. Our Internet site and the information contained on or connected to that site are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Deterioration of or instability in the global economy and financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements. Our business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. During 2011, the global economy showed signs of recovering from the widespread recessionary conditions of 2008 and 2009, 16 Table of Contents which witnessed record levels of unemployment in some countries and extreme volatility in and tightening of the capital and credit markets. However, uncertainty remains as to the overall rate and sustainability of the recovery, particularly in Europe, and we cannot assure you that we will not experience further recessionary conditions and other adverse effects from broad economic trends, or that any improvements will be broad-based and will benefit the markets we serve. The deterioration or instability of the economies and financial markets in the geographies in which we do business could adversely affect the Company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, including having the effect of: • reducing demand for our products and services, increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies; • increasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories; • increasing price competition in our served markets; • resulting in supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products; • increasing the risk of impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets; and • increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which, in addition to increasing the risks identified above, could result in preference actions against us. In particular, the European debt crisis and the instability and uncertainty relating to the Euro could constrain government budgets, limit the financing available to our suppliers and customers and adversely affect the economies and capital markets in Europe and other geographies, which could in turn adversely affect demand for our products, the availability of supplies and the value of our Euro-denominated assets and obligations. Although we have been able to continue accessing the commercial paper markets through the date of this report, there can be no assurances that the commercial paper markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations. The restructuring actions that we have taken to reduce costs could have long-term adverse effects on our business. In 2008, 2009 and 2011, we implemented significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure. These restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities (including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses) have the effect of reducing our available talent, assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and technologies, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly as demand for our products increases. These circumstances could adversely impact our financial statements. Our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve, and visibility into our markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. Certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, in certain of our businesses product demand depends on customers’ capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies, and matters of public policy as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities. Our product demand is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in incentive programs, new product introductions and customer inventory levels. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period. We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand, decreased market share and price reductions for our products. Our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. Because of the diversity of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors; please see “Item 1. Business – Competition” for additional details. In order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrate new markets, including in developing countries. Our failure to compete effectively and/or pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements. 17 Table of Contents Our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new products and product enhancements based on technological innovation. We generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop innovative new products and product enhancements on a timely basis, our products will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer. Our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to: • correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences; • allocate our research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects; • anticipate and respond to our competitors’ development of new products and technological innovations; • differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings and avoid product commoditization; • innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets; • obtain adequate intellectual property rights; • successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time; and • encourage customers to adopt new technologies. In addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners. We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits, could cause us to incur significant legal fees and could damage our reputation. Any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price. We may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price. Promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including high valuations, competition among prospective buyers, the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and antitrust and other regulatory approvals and the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets. In addition, competition for acquisitions in our current and anticipated business areas is significant and may result in higher purchase prices. Changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions. Our ability to grow revenues, earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies. Our acquisition of businesses, including our acquisition of Beckman Coulter, could negatively impact our financial statements. As part of our business strategy we acquire businesses in the ordinary course, some of which may be material; please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) for additional details. In particular, as of the date of this report the acquisition of Beckman Coulter, Inc. in June 2011 18 Table of Contents was Danaher’s largest acquisition and has expanded Danaher’s business into new markets. Our acquisitions involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal and other risks and challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our financial statements: • Any acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it, or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable. • Acquisitions could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations in any given period, or over the long-term. • Pre-closing and post-closing acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period to period. • Acquisitions could create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address. • We could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other systems and retaining key employees and customers. • We may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition. • We may assume by acquisition unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company’s activities. The realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations. • In connection with acquisitions, we often enter into post-closing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments, earn-out obligations and indemnification obligations, which may have unpredictable financial results. • As a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded significant goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets on our balance sheet. If we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets. The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities. Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements. Divestitures could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements. We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. Divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business. For example, when we decide to sell a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms and within our anticipated timeframe, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not become satisfied. In addition, divestitures may dilute the Company’s earnings per share, have other adverse accounting impacts and distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. In addition, we have retained responsibility for and/or have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold, such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims and environmental matters. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue. Certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and by comparable agencies of other countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information. Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements. Certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the FDA, by comparable agencies of other countries and by regulations governing radioactive or other hazardous materials (or the manufacture and sale of products containing such materials). For more information regarding these regulations please see “Item 1 – Business – Regulatory Matters.” We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory 19 Table of Contents clearance (such as 510(k) clearance) for our new products or modifications to existing products within the anticipated timeframe or at all, and if we do obtain such clearance it may be time-consuming, costly and restrictive. Our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances will depend on many factors, including our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results, and the process for obtaining such clearances could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained. Failure to obtain such regulatory clearances before marketing our products, other violations of these regulations, efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products (even after obtaining clearance for distribution) and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to FDA Form 483 Inspectional Observations, warning letters, notices to customers, declining sales, loss of customers, loss of market share, recalls, seizures of adulterated or misbranded products, injunctions, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, suspension or withdrawal of approvals and pre-market notification rescissions. As Beckman Coulter previously reported in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a stand-alone company, the business is addressing issues raised by the FDA relating to its compliance and quality systems and product clearances for certain of its assays. These matters have been the subject of Form 483 Inspectional Observations and warning letters issued by the FDA to certain of the business’ facilities. Although the obtaining of regulatory clearances and other resolutions with respect to these matters depends upon many factors and the timing thereof cannot be predicted with certainty, the business is working diligently to address these issues. We are also subject to various laws regulating (1) fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, and (2) the privacy and security of health information, including the federal regulations described in “Item 1 – Business – Regulatory Matters.” Many states and foreign countries have also adopted laws and regulations similar to, and in some cases more stringent than, such federal regulations. For more information regarding these regulations please see “Item 1 – Business – Regulatory Matters.” Failure to comply with the regulations described above could result in the adverse effects referenced below under “Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation.” Compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses. The healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, which could adversely affect our financial statements. The healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, including the following: • Many of our customers, and the end-users to whom our customers supply products, rely on government funding of and reimbursement for healthcare products and services and research activities. The recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “PPACA”), healthcare austerity measures in Europe and other potential healthcare reform changes and government austerity measures may reduce the amount of government funding or reimbursement available to customers or end-users of our products and services. Global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement. • Beginning in 2013, the PPACA will also impose a 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States as well as new reporting and disclosure requirements on medical device manufacturers. • Governmental and private healthcare providers and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the delivery of healthcare services, forming group purchasing organizations to improve their purchasing leverage and using competitive bid processes to procure healthcare products and services. These changes may cause participants in the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services, reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products services from governmental agencies or third-party payors, reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services, increase our tax liabilities and increase our compliance and other costs. In addition, we may be unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us, and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability. All of the factors described above could adversely affect our financial statements. 20 Table of Contents Our operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation. Our operations, products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use, generation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. We must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the U.S. and abroad in connection with our operations. We cannot assure you that our environmental, health and safety compliance program has been or will at all times be effective. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements. In addition, we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. We are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. We may also become subject to additional remedial, compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules. For additional information regarding these risks, please refer to “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters.” We cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or cleanup in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. However, based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2011 will have a material effect on our financial statements. Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation. In addition to the anticorruption, environmental, health, safety and FDA-related regulations noted above, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the federal, state and local levels, including the following: • We are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons and dealings between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. In other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory. • We also have agreements to sell products and services to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. Our agreements with government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification at the convenience of the government or in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors, and we may underestimate our costs of performing under the contract. Government contracts that have been awarded to us following a bid process could become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder, which could result in loss of the contract. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts. These are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. Failure to comply with these or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to manufacture, import, export and sell products and services, disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies, damage to our reputation and loss of customers and could cause us to incur significant legal fees. Compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses. Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the ISO, and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our financial statements. For additional information regarding these risks, please refer to “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters.” 21 Table of Contents We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. At December 31, 2011, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets totaled approximately $17.1 billion. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized. Foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements. Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products and services purchased overseas. Our sales and expenses are also translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects. In addition, certain of our businesses may invoice customers in a currency other than the business’ functional currency, and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable translation effects. Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Please see the MD&A for a discussion of the factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period. The impact of these factors may be substantially different from period to period. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. Due to the potential for changes to tax law and the ambiguity of tax laws, the subjectivity of factual interpretations and other factors, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. If these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services and intellectual property are complex and can also affect our tax liabilities. We are subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements. We are subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiture-related matters. These lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management’s attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. In addition, developments in legal proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, make estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. We cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and similar proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation. However, based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and similar proceedings in excess of our reserves as of December 31, 2011 will have a material effect on our financial statements. 22 Table of Contents If we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights. We own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our business. The intellectual property rights that we obtain, however, may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. In addition, the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented or designed-around, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights. Third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services. From time to time, we receive notices from third parties regarding intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. Any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. In addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to critical technology, be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services, be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements. Even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our financial statements. Product defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. Manufacturing or design defects in (including in products or components that we source from third parties), unanticipated use of, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products that we make or sell can lead to personal injury, death or property damage. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products, result in the removal of a product from the market and result in product liability claims being brought against us. Recalls, removals and product liability claims can result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products. Our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow, and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $5.3 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, based on the availability under our credit facilities as of December 31, 2011, we had the ability to incur an additional $1.5 billion of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facilities. Our debt level and related debt service obligations can have negative consequences, including (1) requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and capital investment; (2) reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and (3) exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. We may incur significantly more debt in the future, particularly to finance acquisitions. 23 Table of Contents Our current revolving credit facility and long-term debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us; for more information please refer to the MD&A. If we breach any of these restrictions and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. In addition, any failure to maintain the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies would adversely affect our cost of funds and could adversely affect our liquidity and access to the capital markets. If we add new debt, the risks described above could increase. Adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns of, key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements. Certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and end-users. Some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors’ products, and if they favor our competitors’ products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. Adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners, or adverse developments in their financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns, could adversely affect our financial statements. Changes in the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period. In addition, the consolidation of distributors in certain of our served industries, as well as the formation of large and sophisticated purchasing groups in industries such as healthcare, could adversely impact our profitability. We may incur higher costs to produce our products if commodity prices rise. As discussed in “Item 1. Business – Materials,” our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of raw materials. Prices for and availability of these raw materials have fluctuated significantly in the past. Due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve, the cost-containment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to, if commodity prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we are unable to fully recover higher raw material costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions, or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs, we could experience lower margins and profitability and our financial statements could be adversely affected. If we cannot adjust the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changing market conditions or customer demand, our profitability may suffer. In addition, our reliance upon sole sources of supply for certain materials and components could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies. We purchase materials, components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations. Our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations, including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality. During a market upturn, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices. If we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand, we may not be able to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed or our costs may increase. Conversely, in order to secure supplies for the production of products, we sometimes enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer. In addition, some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. If these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, terrorist actions, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes. Any of these factors could result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies. If we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity to reflect the demand for our products, our profitability may suffer. Because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements. Any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our profitability. 24 Table of Contents Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as regulations governing health and safety, the environment, food and drugs, privacy and electronic communications. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Any significant change in any of these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products. In addition, in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations. In these markets, the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations, or the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address, could adversely affect demand for our products. In addition, the manner in which regulations and related regulatory deadlines impact demand for our products may be substantially different from period to period. Work stoppages, union and works council campaigns, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations. We have a number of U.S. collective bargaining units and various non-U.S. collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and potential labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations. International economic, political, legal and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements. In 2011, approximately 58% of our sales were derived from customers outside the U.S. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located outside the U.S. Since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the U.S. and increase the localization of our products and services, we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the U.S., particularly in emerging markets, such as China, India and Brazil. Our international business (and particularly our business in emerging markets) is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations, including: • interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers; • differences in terms of sale, including payment terms; • local product preferences and product requirements; • changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions (including safety and health issues); • trade protection measures and import or export restrictions and requirements; • unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including negative changes in tax laws; • limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash; • the potential for nationalization of enterprises; • limitations on legal rights and our ability to enforce such rights; • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations; • differing labor regulations; • difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis; and • differing protection of intellectual property. Any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and growth. If we suffer loss to our facilities, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe, attacks or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed. Our facilities, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, earthquake, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In addition, attacks on our information technology systems and networks could result in the compromising of confidential information, manipulation or destruction of data or improper use of our systems and networks. If any of these facilities, systems or networks were to experience a catastrophic loss or attack, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses. The third-party insurance coverage that we maintain with respect to these and other risks will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against losses. 25 Table of Contents Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets, investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements. We own a 50% interest in but do not control the Apex Tool Group joint venture, and as a result we may not be able to direct management of the joint venture in a manner that we believe is in Danaher’s best interests. In 2010, Danaher and Cooper Industries plc formed a joint venture named Apex Tool Group LLC. Each company contributed its respective tools business to, and received a 50% interest in, the joint venture. Our joint venture partner may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint venture. Since we do not control the joint venture, we may not be able to direct the management and operations of the joint venture in the manner that we believe is most appropriate. In addition, the joint venture agreement gives each party veto rights with respect to certain fundamental corporate actions, and as a result we cannot assure you that we could effect certain fundamental corporate actions that we believe would be in Danaher’s best interests. Any of these circumstances and any conflict that may arise between the parties could adversely impact our financial statements. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate headquarters are located in Washington, D.C. in a facility that we lease. At December 31, 2011, we had approximately 241 significant manufacturing and distribution facilities worldwide. 123 of these facilities are located in the United States in over 40 states and 118 are located outside the United States in over 50 other countries, primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia, the rest of North America, Latin America and Australia. These facilities cover approximately 22.8 million square feet, of which approximately 13.4 million square feet are owned and approximately 9.4 million square feet are leased. Particularly outside the United States, facilities often serve more than one business segment and may be used for multiple purposes, such as administration, sales, manufacturing, warehousing and/or distribution. The number of significant facilities by business segment is: • Test & Measurement, 39; • Environmental, 41; • Life Sciences & Diagnostics, 79; • Dental, 23; and • Industrial Technologies, 59. We consider our facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used and do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. We believe our properties and equipment have been well-maintained. Please refer to Note 13 in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for additional information with respect to our lease commitments. ITEM 3.

MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol DHR. As of February 13, 2012, there were approximately 3,616 holders of record of our common stock. The high and low common stock prices per share as reported on the New York Stock Exchange, and the dividends paid per share, in each case for the periods described below, were as follows: 2011 2010 High Low DividendsPer Share High Low DividendsPer Share First quarter $ 52.52 $ 45.99 $ 0.020 $ 40.38 $ 35.01 $ 0.020 Second quarter $ 55.72 $ 51.11 $ 0.020 $ 43.65 $ 36.22 $ 0.020 Third quarter $ 55.02 $ 40.52 $ 0.025 $ 41.43 $ 35.71 $ 0.020 Fourth quarter $ 50.86 $ 40.42 $ 0.025 $ 47.35 $ 39.70 $ 0.020 Our payment of dividends in the future will be determined by our Board of Directors and will depend on business conditions, our earnings and other factors. During the third quarter of 2011, the Company increased its regular quarterly dividend from $0.020 per share to $0.025 per share by declaring a dividend of $0.025 per share that was paid on October 28, 2011 to holders of record as of September 30, 2011. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Neither the Company nor any “affiliated purchaser” repurchased any shares of Company common stock during 2011. On May 11, 2010, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20 million shares of the Company’s common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. There is no expiration date for the Company’s repurchase program. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by the Company’s management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Company’s equity compensation plans (or any successor plans) and for other corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2011, 20 million shares remain available for repurchase pursuant to this program. Recent Issuances of Unregistered Securities During the fourth quarter of 2011, holders of certain of the Company’s Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2021 (“LYONs”) converted such LYONs into an aggregate of 9,154 shares of Danaher common stock, par value $0.01 per share.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide a reader of Danaher’s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of Company management. The Company’s MD&A is divided into four main sections: • Overview • Results of Operations • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Critical Accounting Estimates OVERVIEW General Please see “Item 1. Business – General” for a discussion of Danaher’s objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value. Danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations. During 2011, approximately 58% of Danaher’s sales were derived from customers outside the United States. As a global business, Danaher’s operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors. Danaher’s geographic and industry diversity, as well as the diversity of its products and services, typically helps limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results. Given the broad range of products manufactured, services provided and geographies served, management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the Company. The Company’s individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future. As a result of the Company’s geographic and industry diversity, the Company faces a variety of challenges and opportunities, including rapid technological development in most of the Company’s served markets, the expansion of opportunities in emerging markets, trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force and consolidation of the Company’s competitors. The Company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and the Company’s long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in high-growth geographies and high-growth product segments, identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative new products and services with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of the Company’s sales force and continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality. The Company is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources (particularly in emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil) in order to be responsive to the Company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the Company’s operations. Business Performance and Outlook While differences exist among the Company’s businesses, on an overall basis, demand for the Company’s products and services increased in 2011 as compared to 2010 resulting in aggregate year-over-year sales growth. In addition, the Company’s previous investment in sales growth initiatives and the other business-specific factors discussed below contributed to year-over-year sales growth. Geographically, year-over-year sales growth rates during 2011 were led primarily by China and other emerging markets. Sales growth rates in developed markets were led by North America. Providing no significant deterioration in general economic conditions occurs, the Company expects sales from existing businesses to continue to grow on a year-over-year basis during 2012 but at a moderating rate from that experienced during 2011, particularly in the Industrial Technologies segment, and to a lesser extent, the Test & Measurement segment. The acquisition of Beckman Coulter, Inc. (“Beckman Coulter”) as discussed below provides additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Company’s Life Sciences and Diagnostics segment by expanding the businesses’ geographic and product line diversity, including new and complementary product and service offerings in the areas of clinical diagnostics and life sciences research, and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses. As Beckman Coulter is integrated into the Company, the Company also expects to realize significant cost synergies through the application of the Danaher Business System and the combined purchasing power of the Company and Beckman Coulter. For a discussion of the acquisition’s impact on the Company and segment results, please refer to the “Results of Operations” section of this MD&A. 30 Table of Contents Acquisitions and Divestitures On June 30, 2011, following the successful completion of the Company’s tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Beckman Coulter, the Company completed the acquisition of Beckman Coulter by merging one of its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries with and into Beckman Coulter such that Beckman Coulter became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Beckman Coulter develops, manufactures and markets products that simplify and automate complex biomedical testing. Beckman Coulter’s diagnostic systems are found in hospitals and other clinical settings around the world and produce information used by physicians to diagnose disease and make treatment decisions. Scientists use its life science research instruments to study complex biological problems including causes of disease and potential new therapies or drugs. Beckman Coulter had revenues of approximately $3.7 billion in 2010, and is included in the Company’s Life Sciences & Diagnostics segment. The Company paid approximately $5.5 billion in cash (net of approximately $450 million cash acquired) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Beckman Coulter and assumed approximately $1.6 billion of indebtedness in connection with the acquisition. The Company financed the acquisition of Beckman Coulter using (1) approximately $2.3 billion of available cash, (2) net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, of approximately $966 million from the underwritten public offering of the Company’s common stock on June 21, 2011, (3) net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, of approximately $1.8 billion from the underwritten public offering of senior unsecured notes on June 23, 2011, and (4) net proceeds from the sale of additional commercial paper under the Company’s U.S. commercial paper program prior to the closing of the acquisition. In addition to the acquisition of Beckman Coulter during 2011, the Company completed the acquisition of thirteen other businesses (including the acquisition of EskoArtwork, a leading full service solutions provider for the digital packaging design and production market), for total consideration of $669 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The additional businesses acquired manufacture and distribute products and/or provide services in the product identification, water quality, life sciences and diagnostic, test and measurement, retail petroleum and dental markets and were acquired to complement existing units of the Industrial Technologies, Environmental, Life Sciences & Diagnostics, Test & Measurement and Dental segments. The aggregate annual sales of the thirteen businesses acquired at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the acquired company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $325 million. In April 2011, the Company sold its Pacific Scientific Aerospace (“PSA”) business for a sale price of $680 million in cash. This business, which was part of the Industrial Technologies segment and supplies safety, security and electric power components to commercial and military aerospace markets globally, had annual revenues of $377 million in 2010. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company reported an after-tax gain on the sale of approximately $202 million or $0.29 per diluted share. In November 2011, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its integrated scanning system business (the “Accu-Sort businesses” or “ASI”) for a sale price of approximately $135 million in cash, and the sale was consummated in January 2012. In addition, in December 2011, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Kollmorgen Electro-Optical (“KEO”) business for a sale price of approximately $210 million in cash, and the sale was consummated in February 2012. These businesses were part of the Industrial Technologies segment. ASI supplies bar code scanning and dimensional measurement systems and KEO designs, develops, manufactures, and integrates highly engineered, stabilized electro-optical/ISR systems that integrate into submarines, surface ships and ground vehicles. The businesses had combined annual revenues of $275 million in 2011. The Company expects to reflect an aggregate after-tax gain on the sale of these businesses of approximately $93 million or $0.13 per diluted share in its first quarter 2012 results in connection with the closing of these transactions. The Company has reported the PSA, ASI and KEO businesses as discontinued operations in this Form 10-K. Accordingly, the results of operations for all periods presented have been reclassified to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations and the assets and liabilities of these businesses have been reclassified as held for sale for all periods presented. 31 Table of Contents During 2010, the Company completed the acquisition of the Analytical Technologies division of MDS Inc., which included a 50% ownership position in the Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex joint venture (“AB Sciex”) and a 100% ownership position in the Molecular Devices business (“Molecular Devices”). In a separate but related transaction, the Company simultaneously completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership position in AB Sciex from Life Technologies Corporation. In addition, during 2010, the Company entered into a joint venture with Cooper Industries, plc (“Cooper”), combining certain of the Company’s hand tool manufacturing and distribution businesses with Cooper’s Tools business to form a new entity called Apex Tool Group, LLC (“Apex”). For a full discussion of the Company’s 2010 acquisition activity and the Apex joint venture, refer “Liquidity and Capital Resources —Investing Activities”. 2011 Restructuring Activities Consistent with the Company’s approach of positioning itself to provide superior products and services to its customers in a cost efficient manner, and in light of the uncertain macro-economic environment, the Company incurred $179 million (including $120 million in the fourth quarter) of costs associated with restructuring activities. Included in the total restructuring costs are costs associated with the integration and restructuring of the Beckman Coulter business subsequent to the acquisition. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 28.0% compared to 2010. Sales from existing businesses increased 7.0% on a year-over-year basis. The impact of currency translation increased reported sales by 2.5% as the U.S. dollar was, on average, weaker against other major currencies during 2011 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2010. The sales increase from acquired businesses more than offset the year-over-year sales decline attributable to the 2010 contribution of businesses to the Apex joint venture and on a net basis increased reported sales by 18.5%. In this report, references to sales from existing businesses refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) but excluding (1) sales from acquired businesses, (2) 2010 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the Apex joint venture, and (3) the impact of currency translation. References to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to GAAP sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses and 2010 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the Apex joint venture) and (b) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses and 2010 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the Apex joint venture) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. Sales from existing businesses should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting sales from existing businesses provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from sales from existing businesses because currency translation is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions because the nature, size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. The Company excludes the effect of the 2010 sales attributable to the businesses contributed to the Apex joint venture because the Company did not recognize sales from those businesses in 2011. Operating profit margins were 16.3% for each of the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons benefited 160 basis points from the favorable impact of higher sales volumes and continued productivity improvements net of the impact of costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments. The dilutive effect of acquisitions (net of the favorable impact to operating profit margin of contributing certain businesses to the Apex joint venture in July 2010) adversely impacted operating margin comparisons by 110 basis points. In addition, acquisition related charges associated with the Beckman Coulter acquisition, including transaction costs, change in control charges and fair value adjustments to acquisition related inventory and deferred revenue balances (net of comparable acquisition related charges in 2010) adversely impacted operating profit margin comparisons by 50 basis points. 32 Table of Contents Operating profit margins were 16.3% in the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to 13.7% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in operating profit margins during 2010 is primarily a result of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 as well as cost savings attributable to the Company’s 2009 restructuring activities. Year-over-year operating margin comparisons also benefited from approximately 160 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 as compared to 2010. The favorable settlement of litigation with Align Technologies in the third quarter 2009 adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 75 basis points. The net dilutive effect of acquired businesses, 2009 divestitures and the operating profit margin impact of contributing certain businesses to the Apex joint venture in 2010 adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by approximately 65 basis points. 2010 acquisition related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances as well as 2010 transaction costs deemed significant by the Company (net of comparable acquisition related charges and costs recorded in 2009) also adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 35 basis points as such charges and costs were greater in 2010 than in 2009. The Company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant (generally relating to the Company’s larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for the Company in a given period. Business Segments The following table summarizes sales by business segment for each of the periods indicated ($ in millions): For the Year Ended December 31 2011 2010 2009 Test & Measurement $ 3,390.9 $ 2,832.9 $ 2,221.3 Environmental 2,939.6 2,738.0 2,418.7 Life Sciences & Diagnostics 4,627.4 2,298.3 1,484.9 Dental 2,011.2 1,824.6 1,657.0 Industrial Technologies 3,121.4 2,540.6 2,126.9 Businesses contributed to Apex joint venture — 315.6 607.9 Total $ 16,090.5 $ 12,550.0 $ 10,516.7 TEST & MEASUREMENT The Company’s Test & Measurement segment is a leading global provider of electronic measurement instruments and monitoring, management and optimization tools for communications and enterprise networks and related services.

Test & Measurement Selected Financial Data ($ in millions) For the Year Ended December 31 2011 2010 2009 Sales $ 3,390.9 $ 2,832.9 $ 2,221.3 Operating profit 751.2 572.9 301.4 Depreciation and amortization 126.6 107.8 93.5 Restructuring and other related charges 18.8 — 67.7 Operating profit as a % of sales 22.2 % 20.2 % 13.6 % Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales 3.7 % 3.8 % 4.2 % Restructuring and other related charges as a % of sales 0.6 % — 3.0 % 33 Table of Contents Components of Sales Growth 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Existing businesses 9.5 % 17.0 % Acquisitions 8.0 % 10.5 % Currency exchange rates 2.0 % — Total 19.5 % 27.5 % 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 Year-over-year price increases in the segment had a negligible impact on sales growth during 2011. During 2011, sales in the segment’s instrument businesses grew on a year-over-year basis due to increased demand for oscilloscopes and service and installation tools, partially offset by year-over-year declines in sales attributable to products serving the video end markets. Instrument sales grew in all major geographies during the year led by Asia and other emerging markets. Instrument sales grew primarily during the first three quarters of 2011 as fourth quarter 2011 sales were essentially flat compared to 2010. Sales of instruments are expected to continue to grow during 2012 on year-over-year basis, albeit at a rate lower than was experienced during 2011. Sales in the segment’s communications businesses also grew during 2011 on a year-over-year basis, primarily in North America, as a result of strong demand for both network management solutions and core network enterprise solutions. Global demand for network security and analysis solutions was also robust in 2011. Operating profit margins increased 200 basis points during 2011 as compared to 2010. Year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons benefited 220 basis points from the favorable impact of higher sales volumes and continued productivity improvements net of the impact of costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments. The dilutive effect of acquired businesses adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 20 basis points. 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 Year-over-year price increases in the segment had a negligible impact on sales growth during 2010. During 2010, demand increased significantly for the business’ core instruments, including oscilloscopes, thermography products and digital multi-meters. Sales were strong in all major geographies, with particular strength in China. In addition, distributor inventory reductions that occurred in the first three quarters of 2009 due to the recessionary economic conditions did not continue into 2010 which positively impacted the year-over-year comparisons. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s communications businesses grew at a low double-digit rate during 2010 on a year-over-year basis driven by strong demand for both network management solutions and core network enterprise solutions. Operating profit margins increased 660 basis points in 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase in operating profit margins during the period is primarily a result of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 as well as cost savings attributable to the Company’s 2009 restructuring activities. Year-over-year operating margin comparisons for 2010 also benefited from approximately 265 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010. 2010 acquisition related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances (net of comparable acquisition related charges recorded in 2009) favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 55 basis points as such charges were greater in 2009 than in 2010. The dilutive effect of acquired businesses had a net adverse impact of 130 basis points on year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons, partially offsetting these favorable year-over-year factors. ENVIRONMENTAL The Company’s Environmental segment provides products that help protect customers’ water supply and air quality and serves two primary markets: water quality and retail/commercial petroleum. Danaher’s water quality business is a global leader in water quality analysis and treatment, providing instrumentation and disinfection systems to help analyze and manage the quality of ultra pure, potable, and waste water in residential, commercial, industrial and natural resource applications. Danaher’s retail/commercial petroleum business is a leading worldwide provider of products and services for the retail/commercial petroleum market. 34 Table of Contents Environmental Selected Financial Data ($ in millions) For the Year Ended December 31 2011 2010 2009 Sales $ 2,939.6 $ 2,738.0 $ 2,418.7 Operating profit 622.7 564.3 471.0 Depreciation and amortization 45.9 45.9 43.1 Restructuring and other related charges 7.5 — 31.7 Operating profit as a % of sales 21.2 % 20.6 % 19.5 % Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales 1.6 % 1.7 % 1.8 % Restructuring and other related charges as a % of sales 0.3 % — 1.3 % Components of Sales Growth 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Existing businesses 4.0 % 10.5 % Acquisitions 1.5 % 3.0 % Currency exchange rates 2.0 % (0.5 %) Total 7.5 % 13.0 % 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 Price increases in the segment contributed 1.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2011 as compared to 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s water quality businesses grew at a high single-digit rate during 2011 as compared to 2010. Strong demand during the first half of 2011 for the businesses’ laboratory and process instrumentation product lines in the municipal and industrial markets moderated slightly during the second half of 2011. While demand in the China municipal market increased on a year-over-year basis during 2011, the rate of revenue growth for the year declined compared to the 2010 growth rate. Sales in the business’ ultraviolet water treatment product line grew at a low double-digit rate on a year-over-year basis as municipal markets returned to growth in the second half of the year, and in particular during the fourth quarter, after having declined in the first half of 2011. Sales in the segment’s ultraviolet water treatment product line are expected to decline in the first quarter 2012 on a year-over-year basis due, in large part, to a difficult prior year comparison resulting from strong industrial sales in the first quarter 2011. Sales in the business’ chemical treatment solutions product line also grew at a low double-digit rate on a year-over-year basis primarily due to the addition of new customers in the U.S. market and to a lesser extent to continued international expansion. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s retail/commercial petroleum equipment businesses declined at a low single-digit rate during 2011 as compared to 2010. The year-over-year sales decline during the period is primarily attributable to 2010 performance dynamics. The business generated strong sales of payment and point-of-sale retail solutions product offerings in 2010, particularly the first half of 2010, driven by deadlines for compliance with enhanced industry security standards. During 2011, increased demand for the business’ automatic tank gauge products and dispensing equipment in all major geographies resulted in year-over-year sales growth that partially offset the unfavorable impact of the difficult prior year comparison. Operating profit margins increased 60 basis points during 2011 as compared to 2010. Year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons benefited 70 basis points from the favorable impact of higher sales volumes and continued productivity improvements net of the impact of costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments. The dilutive effect of acquired businesses adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 10 basis points. 35 Table of Contents 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 Price increases in the segment contributed 0.5% to sales growth during 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s water quality businesses grew at a low double-digit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009. Demand for the businesses’ laboratory and process instrumentation product lines was led by industrial markets and was stronger in all major geographies as compared to 2009. Sales in the business’ ultraviolet water treatment product line grew at a high single-digit rate during 2010. Solid year-over-year growth in the product line’s industrial and residential applications was partially offset by a difficult prior year comparison associated with a significant drinking water treatment project that favorably impacted revenues throughout 2009 and into the first half of 2010. Sales in the business’ chemical treatment solutions product line also grew during 2010 as compared to 2009 due, in part, to continuing expansion of the chemical treatment solutions product line outside of the U.S. market. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s retail/commercial petroleum equipment businesses grew at a low double-digit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009. Strong North American demand during 2010 for the business’ payment and point-of-sale retail solutions products was driven by enhanced industry security standards deadlines and contributed significantly to the year-over-year sales growth. Demand for dispensing equipment also increased in all major geographic regions due to an increase in capital spending by customers. Sales declines in the business’ vapor recovery product offerings in North America, primarily due to regulatory compliance deadlines in 2009 compared to 2010, partially offset these increases. Operating profit margins increased 110 basis points in 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase in operating profit margins during the period is primarily a result of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 as well as cost savings attributable to the Company’s 2009 restructuring activities. Year-over-year operating margin comparisons for 2010 also benefited from approximately 100 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010. The dilutive effect of acquired businesses had a net adverse impact of 55 basis points on year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons, partially offsetting these favorable year-over-year factors. Incremental year-over-year investments in 2010 compared to 2009 associated with the segment’s emerging market growth initiatives also negatively impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. LIFE SCIENCES & DIAGNOSTICS The Company’s diagnostics businesses offer a broad range of analytical instruments, reagents, consumables, software and services that hospitals, physician’s offices, reference laboratories and other critical care settings use to diagnose disease and make treatment decisions. The Company’s life sciences businesses offer a broad range of research and clinical tools that scientists use to study cells and cell components to gain a better understanding of complex biological processes. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, medical schools and research institutions use these tools to study the causes of disease, identify new therapies and test new drugs and vaccines. Life Sciences & Diagnostics Selected Financial Data ($ in millions) For the Year Ended December 31 2011 2010 2009 Sales $ 4,627.4 $ 2,298.3 $ 1,484.9 Operating profit 402.3 227.9 179.6 Depreciation and amortization 297.2 90.7 56.6 Restructuring and other related charges 100.9 — 16.7 Operating profit as a % of sales 8.7 % 9.9 % 12.1 % Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales 6.4 % 3.9 % 3.8 % Restructuring and other related charges as a % of sales 2.2 % — 1.1 % 36 Table of Contents Components of Sales Growth 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Existing businesses 7.0 % 9.0 % Acquisitions 91.0 % 46.0 % Currency exchange rates 3.5 % — Total 101.5 % 55.0 % 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 Price increases in the segment contributed 0.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2011 as compared to 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses. The significant growth related to acquisitions was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Beckman Coulter in June 2011 which significantly expanded the segment’s product and service offerings, as further described below. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s acute care diagnostics business grew at a high single-digit rate during 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to continued strong consumable sales related to the business’ installed base of acute care diagnostic instrumentation and new instrument placements, primarily in Europe, China and other Asian markets. Demand for the business’ compact blood gas analyzer also remained strong, particularly in emerging markets. Increased European and emerging market demand for the business’ cardiac care instruments also contributed to year-over-year sales growth. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s pathology diagnostics business also grew at a high single-digit rate during 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of increased demand for advanced staining instruments and consumables, as well as higher sales of core histology systems and consumables, primarily in North America and emerging markets, and to a lesser extent, Europe. The acquisition of Beckman Coulter has significantly expanded the segment’s product portfolio in the area of clinical diagnostics through the addition of new and complementary product and service offerings. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s microscopy businesses grew at a mid single-digit rate during 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of strong demand for confocal and compound instrumentation serving the life sciences research and industrial markets, particularly in China and the emerging markets, and to lesser extent, Europe. A difficult prior year comparison resulting from first quarter 2010 sales associated with Japanese economic stimulus funding partially reduced the reported sales growth for 2011. Strong demand for the business’ broad range of mass spectrometers serving both the academic and proteomic research markets as well as the applied markets resulted in a low double-digit growth rate from sales from existing businesses in the segment’s mass spectrometry business during 2011 as compared to 2010. Sales from existing businesses in the mass spectrometry business grew in all major geographies during 2011 led by strong performance in the Asia Pacific region and North America and to a lesser extent Europe. The acquisition of Beckman Coulter has also expanded the segment’s product portfolio in the area of life sciences research through the addition of new and complementary product and service offerings. Operating profit margins decreased 120 basis points during 2011 as compared to 2010. The dilutive effect of acquisitions, primarily related to costs associated with Beckman Coulter’s restructuring and integration activities, adversely impacted segment operating profit margins by 295 basis points. Acquisition related charges associated with the Beckman Coulter acquisition, including transaction costs, change in control charges and fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue balances (net of comparable acquisition related charges in 2010) also adversely impacted operating profit margins by 95 basis points. Higher sales volumes and continued productivity improvements, net of the impact of costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments, favorably impacted year-over-year comparisons by 270 basis points. The Company expects to realize significant cost synergies through the application of the Danaher Business System to Beckman Coulter and the combined purchasing power of the Company and Beckman Coulter. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales increased during 2011 primarily as a result of the increase in amortization expense associated with the intangible assets acquired in connection with the Beckman Coulter acquisition. In addition, as a majority of the Beckman Coulter customers enter into operating-type lease arrangements for the use of the business’ instrumentation, depreciation expense increased on a year-over-year basis. Depreciation and amortization expense in the segment is expected to continue to be higher than the segment’s historical depreciation and amortization expense levels for these same reasons. 37 Table of Contents 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 Sales growth from acquisitions was primarily attributable to the acquisition of AB Sciex and Molecular Devices in January 2010. Year-over-year price increases in the segment had a negligible impact on sales growth during 2010. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s acute care diagnostics business grew at a high single-digit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 due primarily to strong demand in all major geographies for a new version of the business’ compact blood gas analyzer. Increased European demand for the business’ cardiac care instruments as well as continued strong consumable sales related to the business’ installed base of acute care diagnostic instrumentation also contributed to year-over-year sales growth. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s life sciences instrumentation and pathology diagnostics businesses grew at a high single-digit rate during 2010 as compared 2009. Year-over-year growth was driven primarily by strong demand in all major geographies for new instruments and consumables in the pathology diagnostics business. Increased sales of compound and stereo microscopy equipment serving the life sciences research and industrial markets also contributed to the growth. Japanese economic stimulus funding also positively impacted 2010 sales as purchases were required to be completed by March 2010 in order to be eligible for Japanese stimulus funding. Operating profit margins decreased 220 basis points during 2010 as compared to 2009. Acquisition related charges during 2010 associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances, primarily related to the AB Sciex and Molecular Devices acquisitions, as well as 2010 transaction costs deemed significant by the Company (in each case net of comparable acquisition related charges and costs recorded in 2009) adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 270 basis points as such charges and costs were greater in 2010 than in 2009. The net dilutive effect of acquired businesses had an adverse impact of 265 basis points on year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. The favorable impact of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009, cost savings attributable to the Company’s 2009 restructuring activities and 50 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010 partially offset these adverse impacts. DENTAL The Company’s Dental segment is a leading worldwide provider of a broad range of equipment, consumables and services for the dental market, focused on driving technological innovations that help dental professionals improve clinical outcomes and enhance productivity. Dental Selected Financial Data ($ in millions) For the Year Ended December 31 2011 2010 2009 Sales $ 2,011.2 $ 1,824.6 $ 1,657.0 Operating profit before Align gain 236.1 203.3 130.8 Impact of Align gain — — 85.1 Total operating profit 236.1 203.3 215.9 Depreciation and amortization 94.0 81.7 71.3 Restructuring and other related charges 28.3 — 43.8 Operating profit as a % of sales 11.7 % 11.1 % 13.0 % Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales 4.7 % 4.5 % 4.3 % Restructuring and other related charges as a % of sales 1.4 % — 2.6 % 38 Table of Contents Components of Sales Growth 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Existing businesses 4.5 % 4.5 % Acquisitions 2.5 % 6.5 % Currency exchange rates 3.0 % (1.0 %) Total 10.0 % 10.0 % 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 Price increases throughout the segment contributed 1.0% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2011 as compared to 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses. Sales from existing businesses in the dental consumables businesses grew at a mid single-digit rate in 2011 driven primarily by increased demand for general dentistry consumables and orthodontic products and, to a lesser extent, infection control products. Sales in the dental consumables business grew in all major geographies. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s dental equipment business grew on a year-over-year basis at a mid single-digit rate due to strong imaging and instrument product demand. Increased sales of imaging products were led by North America, and to lesser extent, the emerging markets, while instrument sales growth was driven largely by North America and Europe. Operating profit margins increased 60 basis points during 2011 as compared to 2010. Higher sales volumes and continued productivity improvements, including cost reduction actions in the dental equipment businesses, net of the impact of costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments increased operating profit margin by 95 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The dilutive effect of acquired businesses adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 35 basis points. 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 Price increases throughout the segment contributed 0.5% to sales growth during 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses. Sales from existing businesses in the dental consumables businesses were essentially flat in 2010 as compared to 2009. Robust demand for orthodontia products throughout 2010 in addition to increased sales of infection control products were offset by weak demand for general dentistry consumables (primarily during the first three quarters of 2010) primarily as a result of adjustments to inventory levels in distribution channels that occurred during those periods. Demand in the general dentistry consumable businesses increased sequentially in the fourth quarter 2010 as inventories in the distribution channels returned to more normalized levels. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s dental equipment businesses grew at a low double-digit rate and increased in all major product categories during 2010 as compared to 2009. Growth was led by increased sales in the imaging product lines as a result of strong demand for 3D equipment and a new digital x-ray sensor. Year-over-year demand also increased for the business’ instruments and treatment units. Imaging product sales were particularly strong in North America and Asia, while instrument and treatment unit sales were particularly strong in Europe. Operating profit margins decreased 190 basis points during 2010 as compared to 2009. The decrease in operating profit margins was largely due to the favorable settlement of litigation with Align Technologies that occurred in 2009 and adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 515 basis points. The dilutive effect of acquired businesses had a net adverse impact of 10 basis points on year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. The favorable impact of higher sales volumes during 2010 compared to 2009, cost savings attributable to the Company’s 2009 restructuring activities and 145 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010 partially offset these adverse impacts. INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES The Company’s Industrial Technologies segment designs and manufactures components and systems that are typically incorporated by original equipment manufacturers and system integrators for sale into a diverse set of applications and end-markets. The businesses in this segment also provide service and support, including helping customers with integration and installation and providing services to ensure performance and up-time. The Industrial 39 Table of Contents Technologies segment consists of two strategic lines of business, product identification and motion, as well as the sensors and controls, defense and engine retarder businesses. The Company sold its Pacific Scientific Aerospace business in April 2011, its Accu-Sort business in January 2012 and its Kollmorgen Electro-Optical business in February 2012. These businesses were previously reported as part of the Industrial Technologies segment and all current and prior year results of the segment have been adjusted to exclude the results of these discontinued operations. Industrial Technologies Segment Selected Financial Data ($ in millions) For the Year Ended December 31 2011 2010 2009 Sales $ 3,121.4 $ 2,540.6 $ 2,126.9 Operating profit 655.0 513.3 297.5 Depreciation and amortization 65.8 51.5 51.5 Restructuring and other related charges 23.8 — 52.7 Operating profit as a % of sales 21.0 % 20.2 % 14.0 % Depreciation and amortization as a % of sales 2.1 % 2.0 % 2.4 % Restructuring and other related charges as a % of sales 0.8 % — 2.5 % Components of Sales Growth 2011 vs. 2010 2010 vs. 2009 Existing businesses 11.5 % 19.0 % Acquisitions 9.5 % 0.5 % Currency exchange rates 2.0 % — Total 23.0 % 19.5 % 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 Price increases throughout the segment contributed 2.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2011 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s product identification businesses grew at a high single-digit rate on a year-over-year basis during 2011, primarily due to continued strong demand for core marking and coding equipment. Consumable sales associated with the installed base of marking and coding equipment also contributed to year-over-year growth. Sales grew in all major geographies. The 2011 acquisition of EskoArtwork, a leading full service solutions provider for the digital packaging and design and production market, provides additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the segment by expanding the businesses’ product line diversity and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s motion businesses grew at a high single-digit rate during 2011. Sales growth rates declined in the second half of 2011 compared to growth rates in the first half of 2011, in part due to easier prior year comparisons in the first half of 2011 as well as the impact of slowing demand on a global basis in the second half of 2011, primarily in the technology-related and solar end markets. Year-over-year sales increases in engineered solutions and linear and mechanical motion products during the second half of 2011 more than offset sales declines in industrial automation that occurred primarily in the fourth quarter 2011. Sales grew in all major geographies. Year-over-year sales are expected to decline in the first quarter 2012 due, in part, to softness in technology-related end markets and also due to anticipated lower demand for engineered solutions. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s other businesses grew collectively at a mid-teens rate during 2011 as compared to 2010 due to generally higher demand in the majority of end-markets served. Operating profit margins increased 80 basis points during 2011 as compared to 2010. Year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons benefited 135 basis points from the favorable impact of higher sales volumes and continued productivity improvements. The net dilutive effect of acquired businesses adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 55 basis points. 40 Table of Contents 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 Price increases throughout the segment contributed 1.5% to sales growth during 2010 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s product identification businesses grew at a mid-teens rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to increased demand for core marking and coding equipment as customers released capital spending that had been delayed from prior years. Strong consumable sales associated with the installed base of marking and coding equipment also contributed to year-over-year growth. Sales grew in all major geographies with particular strength in Europe and the emerging markets. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s motion businesses grew at a double-digit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 as demand was strong in the majority of end markets served due primarily to the general economic recovery. While growth was generally broad-based, industrial automation led the growth with strong sales of advanced motor and drive product offerings. Sales increased in all major geographies. Sales from existing businesses in the segment’s other businesses grew collectively at a high-teens digit rate during 2010 as compared to 2009 due to generally higher demand in most major end-markets. Operating profit margins increased 620 basis points during 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase in operating profit margins reflects the impact of higher sales volumes in 2010 compared to 2009 as well as cost savings attributable to the Company’s 2009 restructuring activities. Year-over-year operating margin comparisons for 2010 also benefited from approximately 175 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred in 2009 as compared to 2010. The divestiture of certain lower margin businesses and product lines in the fourth quarter 2009 in connection with the Company’s restructuring activities also favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 50 basis points. COST OF SALES AND GROSS PROFIT For the Year Ended December 31 ($ in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Sales $ 16,090.5 $ 12,550.0 $ 10,516.7 Cost of sales 7,913.9 6,145.5 5,446.6 Gross profit 8,176.6 6,404.5 5,070.1 Gross profit margin 50.8 % 51.0 % 48.2 % Gross profit margins decreased 20 basis points during 2011 as compared to 2010. The combination of the acquisition of Beckman Coulter, which has lower overall gross profit margins than the Company’s existing businesses, and 35 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2011 compared to 2010 adversely impacted gross profit margin comparisons. In addition, acquisition related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances in connection with the acquisition of Beckman Coulter (net of comparable acquisition related charges in 2010 relating primarily to the AB Sciex, Molecular Devices and certain other acquisitions) adversely impacted gross profit margin comparisons by 45 basis points. Higher year-over-year sales volumes and continued productivity improvements partially offset these adverse impacts. The gross profit margin comparison also reflects the benefit of 65 basis points from the contribution to the Apex joint venture at the beginning of the third quarter 2010 of certain of the Company’s hand tools businesses, which had lower average gross profit margins than the remainder of the Company. Gross profit margins for 2010 increased 280 basis points from 2009. The year-over-year increase reflects the impact of higher sales volumes as compared to 2009, year-over-year cost savings attributable to the Company’s 2009 restructuring activities and 90 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 as compared to 2010. Gross profit margins during 2010 also benefited from the contribution to the Apex joint venture at the beginning of the third quarter of certain of the Company’s hand tools businesses. Acquisition related charges recorded in 2010 associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory and deferred revenue balances in connection with the acquisition of AB Sciex, Molecular Devices and certain other acquisitions adversely impacted gross profit margin comparisons by approximately 30 basis points. 41 Table of Contents OPERATING EXPENSES For the Year Ended December 31 ($ in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Sales $ 16,090.5 $ 12,550.0 $ 10,516.7 Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses 4,607.7 3,603.7 3,115.3 Research and development (“R&D”) expenses 1,018.5 774.0 600.3 SG&A as a % of sales 28.6 % 28.7 % 29.6 % R&D as a % of sales 6.3 % 6.2 % 5.7 % Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2011 as compared to 2010. Increased leverage of the Company’s cost base resulting from higher sales volumes during 2011 was partially offset by 60 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2011 compared to 2010 and continued investments in the Company’s sales growth initiatives. In addition, change in control payments to Beckman Coulter employees in connection with the closing of the Beckman Coulter acquisition adversely impacted selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales during 2011. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 90 basis points on a year-over-year basis in 2010 as compared to 2009. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in 2010 reflects the benefit of increased leverage of the Company’s cost base resulting from higher sales volumes during 2010 as compared to 2009, in addition to 70 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 as compared to 2010. Incremental year-over-year investments in the Company’s sales growth initiatives, increased commission costs due to the higher sales volumes and the dilutive effect of certain recently acquired businesses and those businesses’ higher relative operating expense structures partially offset these year-over-year improvements. Research and development expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) as a percentage of sales increased 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis during 2011. Recently acquired businesses with higher average research and development expenditures as well as continued investment in the Company’s new product development initiatives primarily contributed to the increase. The increase also reflects the contribution of most of the Company’s hand tools businesses to the Apex joint venture in the third quarter of 2010, as the contributed businesses had historically lower research and development spending as a percentage of sales relative to the overall Company average. Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales increased 50 basis points during 2010 on a year-over-year basis. The increase is primarily attributable to the contribution of the Company’s hand tools businesses to the Apex joint venture. Overall research and development costs also increased in 2010 compared to 2009 due to recently acquired businesses, primarily AB Sciex and Molecular Devices, with higher average research and development expenditures as well as continued investment in the Company’s new product development initiatives. EARNINGS FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE In July 2010 the Company closed on the formation of the Apex joint venture. As of the closing of the transaction, the Company deconsolidated its contributed businesses and commenced accounting for its investment in the joint venture based on the equity method of accounting. The equity in the earnings of Apex, reflecting the Company’s 50% ownership position subsequent to the formation, is reflected in the earnings from unconsolidated joint venture caption in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 42 Table of Contents The impact on the Company’s results of operations from (1) the contributed business prior to the formation of Apex, and (2) the Company’s equity in the earnings of Apex subsequent to the formation of Apex, is reflected in the table below ($ in millions): For the Year Ended December 31 2011 2010 2009 Prior to formation of Apex Sales — $ 315.6 $ 607.9 Operating profit — 41.5 63.9 Subsequent to formation of Apex Earnings from unconsolidated joint venture $ 66.8 22.8 — Earnings from unconsolidated joint venture increased $44 million for 2011 as compared to 2010, primarily due to a full year of earnings in 2011 as compared to only six months of earnings in 2010 following the closing of the formation of the joint venture in July 2010. INTEREST COSTS For a description of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness, please refer to “–Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities and Indebtedness” below. Interest expense of $142 million in 2011 was approximately $24 million higher than 2010 interest expense of $117 million. The increase in interest expense during 2011 results primarily from the additional debt incurred during the second quarter of 2011 in connection with the Beckman Coulter acquisition. The Company’s average commercial paper borrowings were also higher in 2011 as compared to 2010, in large part due to borrowings used to partially fund the acquisition of Beckman Coulter. Interest expense in 2010 was essentially flat compared to interest expense in 2009. Interest income of $5 million, $6 million and $5 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. INCOME TAXES General Income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the Company’s financial statements. The Company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur. The Company’s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in tax laws. For a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, please refer to “—Cash and Cash Requirements” below. The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for contingent tax liabilities. Based on these reviews, the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities, tax rulings and court decisions and the expiration of statutes of limitation, reserves are adjusted as necessary. For a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors”. 43 Table of Contents Year-Over-Year Changes in Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate The Company’s effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was 20.9%, 22.9% and 18.0%, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for each of 2011, 2010 and 2009 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due principally to the Company’s earnings outside the United States that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate. In addition, the effective tax rate in 2011 is lower than the U.S. statutory rate due to recognition of tax benefits associated with favorable resolution of certain international and domestic uncertain tax positions as a result of a tax ruling, court decision, and lapse of certain tax statutes of limitations, in addition to changes in estimates related to reserves associated with prior period uncertain tax positions. These matters have been treated as discrete items in the periods they occurred and reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately 240 basis points in 2011. The effective tax rate of 22.9% in 2010 is also lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate due to recognition of tax benefits associated with favorable resolutions of certain international and domestic tax positions and the lapse of certain statutes of limitations. These matters have been treated as discrete items in the periods they occurred and reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately 60 basis points in 2010. The Company’s 2009 effective tax rate of 18.0% is also lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate due to recognition of tax benefits associated with favorable resolution of certain international and domestic uncertain tax positions and the lapse of certain tax statutes of limitations, in addition to changes in estimates related to reserves associated with prior period uncertain tax positions. These matters have been treated as discrete items in the periods they occurred and reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately 730 basis points in 2009. The effective tax rate for 2012 is expected to be approximately 24%. The anticipated increase from the 2011 rate is partially attributable to the research and experimentation credit that expired at the end of 2011. INFLATION The effect of broad based inflation on the Company’s revenues and net earnings was not significant in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 or 2009. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit risk, equity prices and commodity prices, each of which could impact its financial statements. The Company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. In addition, the Company’s broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole. Interest Rate Risk The Company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. A change in interest rates on long-term debt impacts the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt but not the Company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2011, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt (excluding the LYONs, which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from its underlying common stock) by approximately $162 million. However, since the Company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturity, the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the Company’s fixed-rate long-term debt does not affect the Company’s results of operations or stockholders’ equity. As of December 31, 2011, the Company’s variable-rate debt obligations consisted primarily of U.S. dollar commercial paper borrowings and to a lesser extent, floating rate senior notes due 2013. As a result the Company’s primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s outstanding commercial paper balances 44 Table of Contents as of December 31, 2011. As these shorter duration obligations mature, the Company anticipates issuing additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. In 2011, a 150% increase in average market interest rates on the Company’s commercial paper borrowings would have increased the Company’s interest expense by approximately $2 million. A 150% hypothetical fluctuation is used as the Company’s actual commercial paper interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2011. In 2011, a 65% increase in average market interest rates on the Company’s $300 million floating rate senior notes due 2013 would have increased the Company’s interest expense by approximately $1 million. A 65% hypothetical fluctuation is used as the Company’s actual coupon interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2011. Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries. The Eurobond Notes described below provide a natural hedge to a portion of the Company’s European net asset position. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the Company’s net investment in international subsidiaries, net of the translation effect of the Company’s Eurobond Notes, is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in major currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2011 (net of the translation effect of the Company’s Eurobond Notes) would result in a reduction of stockholders’ equity of approximately $584 million. The Company also faces exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Although the Company has a U.S. dollar functional currency for reporting purposes, it has manufacturing sites throughout the world and a substantial portion of its costs are incurred, and sales are generated in foreign currencies. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. Currency exchange rates increased reported 2011 sales by 2.5% on a year-over-year basis as the U.S. dollar was, on average, slightly weaker against other major currencies during 2011 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2010. The impact on reported sales due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter 2011 was more than offset by the impact of the U.S. dollar’s weakness against other major currencies during the first three quarters of 2011. As a result of the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies, if the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2011 prevail throughout 2012, currency exchange rates would negatively impact 2012 reported sales by approximately 2.0% relative to the Company’s performance in 2011. Additional strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would have a further negative impact on the Company’s reported sales and results of operations. Any weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would positively impact the Company’s sales and results of operations on an overall basis. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales, profit, and assets and liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with the acquisition of Beckman Coulter, the Company acquired an existing currency swap agreement. The agreement requires the Company to purchase approximately 184 million Japanese Yen (JPY/¥) at a rate of $1 / ¥102.25 on a monthly basis through June 1, 2018. As of December 31, 2011, the aggregate Japanese Yen purchase commitment was approximately ¥14.1 billion (approximately $182 million based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2011). The currency swap does not qualify for hedge accounting, and as a result changes in the fair value of the currency swap are reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2011 the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $8 million related to changes in the fair value of this currency swap. 45 Table of Contents Credit Risk The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, receivables from customers, and derivatives. The Company places cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world, and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds. In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the Company’s customers. The Company’s businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers’ financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate. The Company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and only with high-quality financial institutions and limits its exposure at any one institution. Equity Price Risk The Company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale investments due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the equity securities. A 10% decline in the value of these equity securities as of December 31, 2011 would have reduced the fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio by approximately $29 million. Commodity Price Risk For a discussion of risks relating to commodity prices, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” 46 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Management assesses the Company’s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses, consummating strategic acquisitions, paying interest and servicing debt and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity For the Years Ended December 31 ($ in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Total operating cash flows from continuing operations $ 2,732.0 $ 2,018.7 $ 1,722.8 Payments for additions to property, plant and equipment (334.5 ) (191.1 ) (175.4 ) Cash paid for acquisitions (6,210.8 ) (2,129.7 ) (703.5 ) Cash paid for other investments — — (66.8 ) Proceeds from sale of discontinued operations 680.1 — — Other sources 17.9 31.9 2.8 Net cash used in investing activities (5,847.3 ) (2,288.9 ) (942.9 ) Proceeds from the issuance of common stock 1,112.5 178.4 174.2 Repayments of long-term debt (1,602.4 ) (9.4 ) (24.2 ) Proceeds from public debt offerings 1,785.8 — 744.6 Net proceeds (repayment) of borrowings with maturities of less than 90 days 854.0 — (445.7 ) Payment of dividends (61.3 ) (52.2 ) (41.7 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 2,088.6 116.8 407.2 • Operating cash flows from continuing operations, a key source of the Company’s liquidity, increased $713 million, or approximately 35%, during 2011 as compared to 2010. • Acquisitions constituted the most significant use of cash during 2011. The Company acquired fourteen businesses during 2011, including the acquisition of Beckman Coulter, for total consideration (net of cash acquired) of approximately $6.2 billion. • The Company financed the $5.5 billion acquisition of Beckman Coulter using (1) approximately $2.3 billion of available cash, (2) net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, of approximately $966 million from the underwritten public offering of the Company’s common stock on June 21, 2011, (3) net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, of approximately $1.8 billion from the underwritten public offering of senior unsecured notes on June 23, 2011, and (4) net proceeds from the sale of additional commercial paper under the Company’s U.S. commercial paper program prior to the closing of the acquisition. The Company also assumed approximately $1.6 billion of indebtedness and acquired approximately $450 million of cash in connection with the acquisition. During the third quarter of 2011, the Company retired substantially all of the acquired Beckman Coulter debt using proceeds from the issuance of U.S. dollar commercial paper and recorded an approximate $33 million ($21 million, after tax or $0.03 per diluted share) charge to earnings due to “make whole” payments associated with the retirement of certain of the Beckman Coulter debt. • In April 2011, the Company sold its Pacific Scientific Aerospace business for a sale price of $680 million in cash. • The Company’s 2011 restructuring activities used approximately $49 million in cash during 2011. 47 Table of Contents • The Company contributed approximately $132 million in cash to the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan and approximately $45 million to the Company’s non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans during 2011. • As of December 31, 2011, the Company held approximately $537 million of cash and cash equivalents. Operating Activities The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position. Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for items such as income taxes, restructuring activities, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows. Operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $2.7 billion for 2011, an increase of $713 million, or 35% as compared to 2010. The year-over-year change in operating cash flows from 2010 to 2011 was primarily attributable to the following factors: • Earnings from continuing operations increased by $217 million in 2011 as compared to 2010. Included in 2010 earnings from continuing operations is a non-cash gain of $291 million recognized on the formation of the Apex joint venture, which gain did not recur in 2011 which further contributes to the year-over-year operating cash flow comparison. • Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $247 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The increased depreciation and amortization expense impacts earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows. • The aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable provided $63 million in operating cash flows during 2011, a $258 million improvement over 2010 during which these items used $195 million in operating cash flows. • Cash income tax payments, net of refunds, from continuing operations increased by $21 million during 2011 as compared to 2010. Net cash payments for income taxes from continuing operations totaled $303 million and $282 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. • Partially offsetting these favorable cash flows during 2011 were additional pension contributions and employee benefit payments as compared to 2010. Operating cash flows from continuing operations were approximately $2.0 billion for 2010, an increase of $296 million, or 17% as compared to 2009. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily attributable to the increase in earnings in 2010 as compared to 2009. Partially offsetting this benefit was an investment in trade accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable which in the aggregate used $195 million of operating cash flows during 2010 as compared to contributing $214 million in operating cash flows during 2009. The increased use of cash reflects increased inventory and accounts receivable levels, partially offset by increased accounts payable levels, associated with increased business activity. In connection with the Company’s restructuring activities, the Company records appropriate accruals for the costs of closing facilities, severing personnel and, in connection with acquisitions, integrating the acquired businesses into existing Company operations. Cash flows from operating activities are reduced by the amounts expended against the various accruals established in connection with these activities. During 2011, the Company paid approximately $49 million related to its 2011 restructuring activities. During 2010, the Company paid approximately $110 million related to its 2009 restructuring activities. The Company anticipates cash payments of approximately $124 million during 2012 related to its 2011 restructuring activities. Please refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about these expenditures. Investing Activities Cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures and cash proceeds from divestitures of businesses or assets. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $5.8 billion during 2011 compared to approximately $2.3 billion of net cash used in 2010 and approximately $943 million of net cash used in 2009. 48 Table of Contents Acquisitions and Divestitures 2011 Acquisitions and Divestitures For a discussion of the Company’s 2011 acquisitions and divestitures please refer to “—Overview –Acquisitions and Divestitures.” 2010 Acquisitions and Apex Joint Venture On January 30, 2010, the Company completed the acquisition of the Analytical Technologies division of MDS Inc., which included a 50% ownership position in the AB Sciex joint venture and a 100% ownership position in Molecular Devices. In a separate but related transaction, the Company simultaneously completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership position in AB Sciex from Life Technologies Corporation. The aggregate purchase price for the combined transactions was $1.0 billion, including debt assumed and net of cash acquired. The aggregate sales of AB Sciex and Molecular Devices in their last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition were approximately $650 million and these businesses now operate within the Company’s Life Sciences & Diagnostics segment. The acquisitions of AB Sciex and Molecular Devices significantly expanded the Company’s position in the life sciences and diagnostics business and in particular established a position in the mass spectrometry market. In addition to the acquisitions of AB Sciex and Molecular Devices, the Company acquired seventeen businesses during 2010 for aggregate consideration of approximately $1.1 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. Each company acquired manufactures products and/or provides services in the test and measurement, dental, environmental, life science and diagnostics, sensors and controls or product identification markets. These businesses were acquired to complement existing businesses of the Life Sciences & Diagnostics, Test & Measurement, Dental, Environmental and Industrial Technologies segments. The aggregate annual sales of these seventeen acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $440 million. On July 4, 2010, the Company entered into a joint venture with Cooper Industries, plc, combining certain of the Company’s hand tools businesses with Cooper’s Tools business to form a new entity called Apex Tool Group, LLC. The 2009 sales, on a combined basis, of the two tools businesses contributed to Apex were approximately $1.2 billion. Each of Cooper and the Company owns a 50% interest in Apex and has an equal number of representatives on Apex’s Board of Directors. Upon the closing of the transaction, Apex simultaneously obtained a credit facility and term debt financing and used $45 million of the term debt financing to purchase from the Company certain assets of the Company’s hand tools business. In addition to the cash received for the purchase of these assets, the Company recorded a receivable from Apex of $45 million upon closing. The Company has collected the majority of this receivable as of December 31, 2011 and expects to collect the remaining outstanding balance during 2012. As of the closing of the transaction, the Company deconsolidated the financial results of its contributed businesses and began accounting for its investment in the joint venture based on the equity method of accounting. In accordance with accounting standards applicable to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries, the Company recognized a $291 million gain ($232 million or $0.34 per diluted share on an after-tax basis) during the third quarter 2010 associated with the transaction reflecting the difference between the book value of the contributed business that was deconsolidated and the fair value of the consideration received in exchange, including the 50% interest in Apex and the cash and receivables received from Apex in connection with the transaction. 2009 Acquisitions and Divestitures The Company acquired fifteen businesses during 2009 for consideration of approximately $704 million in cash, net of cash acquired. Each company acquired manufactures products and/or provides services in the life sciences, dental, product identification, environmental or test and measurement markets. These businesses were acquired to complement existing businesses within the Life Sciences & Diagnostics, Dental, Industrial Technologies, Environmental and Test & Measurement segments. The aggregate annual sales of these fifteen acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company’s revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $430 million. In addition, during 2009 the Company divested five businesses or product lines for approximately $10 million of net cash proceeds. The divested businesses were part of the Industrial Technologies and the former Tools and Components segments and had aggregate annual revenues of approximately $53 million in 2009. The Company recorded no significant gain or loss, either individually or in the aggregate, associated with these divestitures. The Company used the proceeds from these sales for general corporate purposes. 49 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development and improving information technology systems. In addition, capital expenditures are made for the manufacture of instruments that are used in operating-type lease arrangements entered into with customers by certain of the Company’s businesses. Capital expenditures totaled $334 million in 2011, $191 million in 2010 and $175 million in 2009. The increase in capital spending in 2011 is primarily due to the acquisition of Beckman Coulter and the associated capitalization of instruments subject to operating-type leases through customer arrangements entered into in the second half of 2011. In 2012, the Company expects capital spending to approximate $550 million, though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions. The expected increase in capital expenditures in 2012 is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Beckman Coulter as the majority of the business’ customers enter into operating-type lease arrangements for use of its instrumentation products. Financing Activities and Indebtedness Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper, common stock and debt, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, payments of principal on indebtedness, repurchases of common stock and payments of dividends to shareholders. Financing activities provided cash of $2.1 billion during 2011 compared to $117 million of cash provided during 2010. The year-over-year change was primarily due to the proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 Financing Notes (as defined below) in June 2011. Total debt was $5.3 billion at December 31, 2011 compared to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2010. The Company’s debt as of December 31, 2011 was as follows: • $977 million of outstanding U.S. dollar denominated commercial paper; • $647 million (€500 million) aggregate principal amount of 4.5% guaranteed Eurobond Notes due 2013 (the “Eurobond Notes”); • $300 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2013 (the “2013 Notes”); • $400 million aggregate principal amount of 1.3% senior notes due 2014 (the “2014 Notes”); • $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.3% senior notes due 2016 (the “2016 Notes”); • $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2018 (the “2018 Notes”); • $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.4% senior notes due 2019 (the “2019 Notes”); • $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.9% senior notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes” and together with the 2013 Notes, 2014 Notes and 2016 Notes, the “2011 Financing Notes”); • $380 million of zero coupon Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2021 (“LYONs”); and • $251 million of other borrowings. The 2011 Financing Notes, the Eurobond Notes, the 2018 Notes and the 2019 Notes are collectively referred to as the “Notes”. Commercial Paper Program and Credit Facility The Company primarily satisfies any short-term liquidity needs that are not met through operating cash flow and available cash through issuances of commercial paper under its U.S. and Euro commercial paper programs. Under these programs, the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.5 billion. Interest expense on the notes is paid at maturity and is generally based on the ratings assigned to the Company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to LIBOR. Borrowings under the program are available for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. During 2011, the Company issued commercial paper under its U.S. program to fund a portion of the purchase price for Beckman Coulter and the retirement of substantially all of the Beckman Coulter debt (see below). As of December 31, 2011, borrowings outstanding under the Company’s U.S. commercial paper program had a weighted average interest rate of 0.2% and a weighted average maturity of approximately 30 days. Commercial paper balances during the year carried interest at rates ranging between 0.1% and 0.2% and original maturities between 1 and 67 days. There was no commercial paper outstanding under the Euro program as of December 31, 2011 or at any other time during 2011. The Company classified its borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs at December 31, 2011 as long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company had the intent and ability, as supported by availability under the Credit Facility referenced below, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date. 50 Table of Contents Credit support for the commercial paper program is provided by a $2.5 billion unsecured multi-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that expires on July 15, 2016 (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Under the Credit Facility, borrowings (other than bid loans) bear interest at a rate equal to (at the Company’s option) either (1) a LIBOR-based rate plus a margin that varies according to the Company’s long-term debt credit rating (the “Eurodollar Rate”), or (2) the highest of (a) the Federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (b) the prime rate and (c) the Eurodollar Rate plus 1%, plus in each case a margin that varies according to the Company’s long-term debt credit rating. Under the Credit Facility, in addition to certain initial fees the Company is obligated to pay a per annum commitment fee that varies according to its long-term debt credit rating. The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the facility) of 0.65 to 1.00 or less, and also contains customary representations, warranties, conditions precedent, events of default, indemnities and affirmative and negative covenants. As of December 31, 2011, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Facility and the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the facility. In addition to the Credit Facility, the Company has entered into reimbursement agreements with various commercial banks to support the issuance of letters of credit. The availability of the Credit Facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of the Company’s commercial paper program. The Company expects to limit any borrowings under the Credit Facility to amounts that would provide sufficient credit available under the facility to allow the Company to borrow, if needed, to repay all of the outstanding commercial paper as it matures. The Company’s ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related costs of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of the Company’s credit rating and market conditions. Any downgrade in the Company’s credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the Company’s commercial paper program and the Credit Facility, and could limit or preclude the Company’s ability to issue commercial paper. If the Company’s access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, the Company would expect to rely on a combination of available cash, operating cash flow and the Company’s Credit Facility to provide short-term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under the Company’s Credit Facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings. On June 17, 2011, the Company entered into a $3.0 billion 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility (the “364-Day Facility”) in connection with the acquisition of Beckman Coulter. The Company reduced the commitments under the 364-Day Facility from $3.0 billion to $2.2 billion effective as of June 27, 2011, from $2.2 billion to $1.5 billion effective as of July 21, 2011, from $1.5 billion to $1.0 billion effective as of October 1, 2011 and terminated the facility as of December 29, 2011. There were no outstanding borrowings under the 364-Day Facility at any time during the term of the facility. Other Long-Term Indebtedness 2011 Financing Notes—On June 23, 2011, the Company completed the underwritten public offering of the 2011 Financing Notes, all of which are unsecured. The 2013 Notes were issued at 100% of their principal amount, will mature on June 21, 2013 and accrue interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 0.25% per year. The 2014 Notes were issued at 99.918% of their principal amount, will mature on June 23, 2014 and accrue interest at the rate of 1.3% per year. The 2016 Notes were issued at 99.84% of their principal amount, will mature on June 23, 2016 and accrue interest at the rate of 2.3% per year. The 2021 Notes were issued at 99.975% of their principal amount, will mature on June 23, 2021 and accrue interest at the rate of 3.9% per year. The net proceeds from the 2011 Financing Notes offering, after deducting expenses and the underwriters’ discount, were approximately $1.8 billion and were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Beckman Coulter. The Company pays interest on the 2013 Notes quarterly in arrears on March 21, June 21, September 21 and December 21 of each year. The Company pays interest on the 2014 Notes, 2016 Notes and 2021 Notes semi-annually in arrears, on June 23 and December 23 of each year. 2019 Notes—In March 2009, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of the 2019 Notes, which were issued at 99.93% of their principal amount, will mature on March 1, 2019 and accrue interest at the rate of 5.4% per annum. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, were approximately $745 million. A portion of the net proceeds were used to repay a portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial paper and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The Company pays interest on the 2019 Notes semi-annually in arrears, on March 1 and September 1 of each year. 51 Table of Contents 2018 Notes—In December 2007, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of the 2018 Notes, which were issued at 99.39% of their principal amount, will mature on January 15, 2018 and accrue interest at the rate of 5.625% per annum. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters’ discount, were approximately $493 million, which were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance the acquisition of Tektronix. The Company pays interest on the 2018 Notes semi-annually in arrears, on January 15 and July 15 of each year. Eurobond Notes—On July 21, 2006, a financing subsidiary of the Company issued the Eurobond Notes in a private placement outside the United States. Payment obligations under these Eurobond Notes are guaranteed by the Company. The net proceeds of the offering, after the deduction of underwriting commissions but prior to the deduction of other issuance costs, were €496 million ($627 million based on exchange rates in effect at the time the offering closed) and were used to pay down a portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. LYONs—In 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in LYONs. The net proceeds to the Company were $505 million, of which approximately $100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The LYONs carry a yield to maturity of 2.375% (with contingent interest payable as described below). Holders of the LYONs may convert each $1,000 of principal amount at maturity into 29.0704 shares of the Company’s common stock (in the aggregate for all LYONs that were originally issued, approximately 24.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January 22, 2021. As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of approximately 10 million shares of the Company’s common stock had been issued upon conversion of LYONs. As of December 31, 2011, the accreted value of the outstanding LYONs was lower than the traded market value of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time at scheduled redemption prices. Holders had the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash and/or Company common stock, at the Company’s option, on each of January 22, 2004 and January 22, 2011, which resulted in aggregate notes with an accreted value of approximately $1 million being redeemed by the Company for cash. Under the terms of the LYONs, the Company will pay contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six month period from January 23 to July 22 and from July 23 to January 22 if the average market price of a LYON for a specified measurement period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. The amount of contingent interest to be paid with respect to any quarterly period is equal to the higher of either 0.0315% of the bonds’ average market price during the specified measurement period or the amount of the common stock dividend paid during such quarterly period multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon conversion of a LYON. The Company paid approximately $1 million of contingent interest on the LYONs for the year ended December 31, 2011. Except for the contingent interest described above, the Company will not pay interest on the LYONs prior to maturity. Covenants and Redemption Provisions Applicable to the Notes The Company may redeem some or all of the 2014 Notes, the 2016 Notes, the 2018 Notes and/or the 2019 Notes at any time by paying the principal amount and a “make-whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Prior to March 23, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), the Company may redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes by paying the principal amount and a “make-whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On or after March 23, 2021, the Company may redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes for their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. If a change of control triggering event occurs with respect to the Notes, each holder of Notes may require the Company to repurchase some or all of its Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued interest (100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of Eurobond Notes). A change of control triggering event means the occurrence of both a change of control and a rating event, each as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture or comparable instrument. Except in connection with a change of control triggering event as described above, the Company does not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt. In addition, the Company may redeem the Eurobond notes upon the occurrence of specified, adverse changes in tax laws, or interpretations under such laws, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed. The indentures and comparable instruments pursuant to which the Notes were issued each contain customary covenants including, for example, limits on the incurrence of secured debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to the Company’s operations and as of December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants. 52 Table of Contents Beckman Coulter Indebtedness In connection with the acquisition of Beckman Coulter, the Company also assumed indebtedness with a fair value of $1.6 billion (the “Beckman Coulter Notes”). During the third quarter of 2011, the Company retired substantially all of the Beckman Coulter Notes using proceeds from the issuance of U.S. dollar commercial paper and recorded an approximate $33 million ($21 million, after tax or $0.03 per diluted share) charge to earnings due to “make whole” payments associated with the extinguishment of certain of the Beckman Coulter Notes. The charge to earnings is reflected as loss on early extinguishment of debt in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. For additional details regarding the Company’s debt as of December 31, 2011 see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Shelf Registration Statement The Company has a “well-known seasoned issuer” shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance. On June 21, 2011, the Company used this shelf registration statement to complete the underwritten public offering of 19,250,000 shares of Danaher common stock at a price to the public of $51.75 per share. The net proceeds, after deducting expenses and the underwriters’ discount, were approximately $966 million and were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for Beckman Coulter. On June 23, 2011, the Company also used this shelf registration statement to complete the underwritten public offering of the 2011 Financing Notes. The Company expects to use the net proceeds from future securities sales off this shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes. These purposes may include, but are not limited to, reduction or refinancing of debt or other corporate obligations; acquisitions; capital expenditures; share repurchases and dividends; and working capital. Stock Repurchase Program On May 11, 2010, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20 million shares of the Company’s common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. There is no expiration date for the Company’s repurchase program. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by the Company’s management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Company’s equity compensation plans (or any successor plans) and for other corporate purposes. Neither the Company nor any “affiliated purchaser” repurchased any shares of Company common stock during 2011 or 2010. As of December 31, 2011, 20 million shares remained available for repurchase pursuant to this program. The Company expects to fund any future repurchases using the Company’s available cash balances or proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. Dividends The Company declared a regular dividend of $0.025 per share that was paid on January 27, 2012 to holders of record on December 30, 2011. Aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2011 were approximately $61 million. Cash and Cash Requirements As of December 31, 2011, the Company held $537 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an average weighted annual interest rate of 0.2%. $14 million of this amount was held within the United States and $523 million was held outside of the United States. The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures and acquisitions, to pay interest and service debt, pay taxes, fund its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, pay dividends to shareholders and repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but 53 Table of Contents in the event that additional liquidity is required, particularly in connection with acquisitions, the Company may also borrow under its commercial paper program or the Credit Facility, enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program and/or access the capital markets as needed. We also may from time to time access the capital markets to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions. While repatriation of some cash held outside the United States may be restricted by local laws, most of the foreign balances could be repatriated to the United States but, under current law, could be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. For most of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company makes an election regarding the amount of earnings intended for indefinite reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. A deferred tax liability has been accrued for the funds that are intended to be repatriated to the United States. No provisions for U.S. income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States, and the amount of U.S. income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the Company could employ if it repatriated these earnings. The cash that our foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments, including acquisitions. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately $7.8 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, management believes that is has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs, including its cash needs in the United States. During 2011, the Company contributed approximately $132 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan and approximately $45 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2012, the Company’s cash contribution requirements for its U.S. plan are not expected to be significant. The Company’s cash contribution requirements for its non-U.S. plans are expected to be approximately $50 million, although the ultimate amounts to be contributed to the U.S. and non-U.S. plans depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan’s funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates and other factors . Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations relating to continuing operations as of December 31, 2011 under (1) long-term debt obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long-term liabilities reflected on the Company’s balance sheet under GAAP. The amounts presented in the table below do not reflect $488 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits. Total Less ThanOne Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than5 Years ($ in millions) Debt & Leases: Long-Term Debt Obligations (a)(b) $ 5,256.5 $ 90.4 $ 1,429.2 $ 1,505.4 $ 2,231.5 Capital Lease Obligations (b) 48.7 8.0 13.2 8.1 19.4 Total Long-Term Debt 5,305.2 98.4 1,442.4 1,513.5 2,250.9 Interest Payments on Long-Term Debt and Capital LeaseObligations (c) 955.4 151.8 260.9 212.0 330.7 Operating Lease Obligations (d) 780.2 195.3 279.9 170.8 134.2 Other: Purchase Obligations (e) 959.5 859.2 56.4 43.7 0.2 Other Long-Term Liabilities Reflected on the Company’s Balance Sheet Under GAAP (f) 3, 036.0 — 656.9 626.8 1,752.3 Total $ 11,036.3 $ 1,304.7 $ 2,696.5 $ 2,566.8 $ 4,468.3 (a) As described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (b) Amounts do not include interest payments. Interest on long-term debt and capital lease obligations is reflected in a separate line in the table. 54 Table of Contents (c) Interest payments on long-term debt are projected for future periods using the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2011. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates. (d) As described in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain leases require us to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises. These future costs are not included in the schedule above. (e) Consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. (f) Primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies and allowances, performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs, self-insurance and litigation claims, post-retirement benefits, pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities (excluding unrecognized tax benefits) and deferred compensation obligations. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management’s estimates over the terms of these arrangements and is largely based upon historical experience. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of off-balance sheet commercial commitments of the Company related to continuing operations as of December 31, 2011. Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period ($ in millions) Total AmountsCommitted Less ThanOne Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than5 Years Guarantees $ 330.0 $ 242.8 $ 69.0 $ 11.8 $ 6.4 Guarantees consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit, bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds. These guarantees have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors, customers, financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure the Company’s obligations and/or performance requirements related to specific transactions. Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters or tax matters. The Company has not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they relate to unknown conditions and the Company cannot estimate the potential liabilities from such matters, but the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. In addition, as a result of these divestitures, as well as restructuring activities, certain properties leased by the Company have been sublet to third parties. In the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by such sub-lessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the Company’s financial statements. In the normal course of business, the Company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers, suppliers or other business partners for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the Company’s products or claims alleging that Company products infringe third-party intellectual property. The Company has not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual commitments table above. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations. The Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the Company, or by reason of serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to limited exceptions. Danaher’s Amended and Restated By-laws provide for similar indemnification rights. In addition, Danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of Danaher Corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights 55 Table of Contents and under which Danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding. While the Company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage. Legal Proceedings Please refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding certain litigation matters. In addition to the litigation matters noted under “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters – Environmental, Health & Safety”, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Company’s products and services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, personal injury and insurance coverage. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, divested businesses. Some of these lawsuits may include claims for punitive and consequential, as well as compensatory damages. Based upon the Company’s experience, current information and applicable law, it does not believe that these proceedings and claims will have a material effect on its financial statements. While the Company maintains general, products, property, workers’ compensation, automobile, cargo, aviation, crime, fiduciary and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (and has acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions) up to certain limits that cover certain of these claims, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses. For general and products liability and most other insured risks, the Company purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses (“stop loss” insurance) and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to amounts within the self-insured retention. In addition, while the Company believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims, these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses. The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company periodically assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes for these matters, as well as amounts or ranges of probable losses, and if appropriate recognizes a reserve for these contingencies. These reserves consist of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts for anticipated developments of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims. The specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified with the assistance of legal counsel and outside risk insurance professionals where appropriate. In addition, outside risk insurance professionals assist in the determination of reserves for incurred but not yet reported claims through evaluation of the Company’s specific loss history, actual claims reported, and industry trends among statistical and other factors. Reserve estimates are adjusted as additional information regarding a claim becomes known. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including litigation developments, the discovery of new facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. While the Company actively pursues financial recoveries from insurance providers, it does not recognize any recoveries until realized or until such time as a sustained pattern of collections is established related to historical matters of a similar nature and magnitude. If the Company’s self-insurance and litigation reserves prove inadequate, it would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s net earnings. Please see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the amount of our accruals for self-insurance and litigation liability. For a discussion of additional risks related to legal proceedings, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” 56 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience, the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments. The Company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to Note 1 in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounts Receivable. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect probable credit losses inherent in its portfolio of receivables. Determination of the allowances requires management to exercise judgment about the timing, frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the allowances for doubtful accounts and, therefore, net income. The allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s best estimate of the credit losses expected from the Company’s trade accounts, contract and finance receivable portfolios based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of collectability and historical loss experience. The level of the allowances is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors including historical loss experience by receivable type, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic conditions and credit risk quality. The Company regularly performs detailed reviews of its accounts receivable portfolio to determine if an impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowances. Additions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are charged to current period earnings; amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowances, while amounts recovered on accounts previously determined to be uncollectible increase the allowances. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required and net earnings would be adversely impacted. Inventories. The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market value. The Company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand, technological advances and pricing competition in many of the Company’s markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the Company’s control. As a result, such fluctuations can be difficult to predict. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, the Company could be required to reduce the value of its inventory, which would adversely impact the Company’s net earnings and financial condition. Acquired Intangibles. The Company’s business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the Company may incur. The Company does not amortize goodwill but does amortize certain identifiable intangible assets, primarily customer relationships and acquired technology, over the estimated useful life of the identified asset. On an annual basis (the first day of the Company’s fiscal fourth quarter) the Company estimates the fair value of each of its reporting units and compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company must perform additional analysis to determine if the reporting unit’s goodwill has been impaired. If circumstances or events prior to the date of the required annual assessment indicate that, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that there has been diminution of fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value, the Company performs an impairment analysis at the time of such circumstance or event. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market based approach. The Company estimates fair value based on earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) multiples determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the Company’s reporting units in addition to market available precedent transactions of comparable businesses. In evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach, management assesses the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data. In certain circumstances the Company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (i.e., an income approach) in order to validate the results of the market approach. Once completed, the results of the income and market approaches are reconciled and compared. The discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and 57 Table of Contents terminal values. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. While the Company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units, if actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had 28 reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. The carrying value of the goodwill included in each individual reporting unit ranges from approximately $7 million to approximately $3.7 billion. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2011 indicated that in all instances, the fair value of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 11% to approximately 560%. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this hypothetical 10% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units ranged from approximately zero to approximately 494%. Reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment. Management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units decreases as these businesses are integrated into the Company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth. Contingent Liabilities. As discussed above under “—Legal Proceedings”, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors, including those discussed above under “—Legal Proceedings”. If the reserves established by the Company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company’s net earnings. Revenue Recognition: The Company derives revenues from the sale of products and services. For revenue related to a product or service to qualify for recognition, there must be persuasive evidence of a sale, delivery must have occurred or the services must have been rendered, the price to the customer must be fixed and determinable and collectability of the balance must be reasonably assured. Refer to Note 1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s revenue recognition policies. Although most of the Company’s sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, certain agreements contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. As a result, judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for sales recognition purposes, and, if so, how the sales price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize sales for each element. For fiscal 2011 and future periods, revenues for contractual arrangements consisting of multiple elements (i.e. deliverables) are recognized for the separate elements when the product or services that are part of the multiple element arrangement have value on a stand-alone basis and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in the Company’s control. The Company allocates revenue to each element in the contractual arrangement based on a selling price hierarchy that, in some instances, may require the Company to estimate the selling price of certain deliverables that are not sold on a stand-alone basis or where third party evidence of pricing is not observable. The Company’s estimate of selling price impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements. For transactions entered into prior to fiscal year 2011, revenue for arrangements with multiple elements is recognized for the separate elements when the product or services that are part of the multiple element arrangement have value on a stand-alone basis, fair value of the separate elements exists (or in the case of software related products, vendor specific objective evidence of fair value) and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in the Company’s control. A portion of the Company’s revenues relate to lease payment arrangements, which require the Company to evaluate whether to account for the arrangement as an operating or sales type lease. Certain of the Company’s lease contracts are customized for larger customers and often result in complex terms and conditions that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criteria. 58 Table of Contents Stock-Based Compensation: The Company accounts for stock-based compensation by measuring the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted, including stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted shares, based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date. For a discussion of the Company’s stock-based compensation accounting practices, refer Note 17 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the awards and stock price volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent the Company’s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company uses different assumptions, the Company’s equity-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, the Company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. If the Company’s actual forfeiture rate during a reporting period is materially different than its estimate, the Company’s earnings may be significantly impacted as the Company records the effect of actual experience in the period it occurs. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits: Certain of the Company’s employees and retired employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans (“pension plans”) and certain eligible retirees are entitled to health care and life insurance benefits under postretirement benefit plans (“postretirement plans”). The Company measures its pension and post retirement plans’ assets and obligations as of the end of each year to determine the funded status of each plan. The Company recognizes an asset for a plan’s overfunded status or a liability for a plan’s underfunded status in its balance sheet. Changes in the funded status of the plans are recognized in the year in which the changes occur and are reported in comprehensive income. Accounting standards require that the amounts the Company records, including the expense or income, associated with the pension and postretirement plans be computed using actuarial valuations. Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations, including assumptions regarding discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rates of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate, changes in the assumptions (as a result of differences in actual experience, changes in key economic indicators or other factors) may affect the Company’s financial position or results of operations. A 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the U.S. net obligation by $125 million ($78 million on an after tax basis) and the non-U.S. net obligation by $77 million ($58 million on an after tax basis) from the amounts recorded in the financial statements at December 31, 2011. For 2011, the expected long-term rate of return assumption applicable to assets held in the U.S. plan has been estimated at 8%. This expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected long-term returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets. The U.S. plan targets to invest between 60% and 70% of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments. The balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in corporate bonds and bond index funds. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2011 was reduced by 50 basis points, pension expense for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans for 2011 would have increased $8 million (or $5 million on an after-tax basis). The Company intends to use an expected long-term rate of return assumption of 7.5% for 2012 for its U.S. plan. The Company’s non-U.S. plan assets consist of various insurance contracts, equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan. The estimated long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 1.25% to 7.90%. For a discussion of the Company’s 2011 and anticipated 2012 defined benefit pension plan contributions, please see “Liquidity and Capital Resources —Cash and Cash Requirements”. Income Taxes: The Company’s income tax expense represents the current tax liability for the year and the tax benefit or expense for the net change in deferred tax liabilities and assets during the year. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the Company’s tax return in future years for which the tax benefit has already been reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances. The determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding: (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the 59 Table of Contents impact of tax planning strategies, and can also be impacted by changes to tax laws. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items that have already been taken as a deduction on the Company’s tax return but have not yet been recognized as an expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon the technical merits, it is “more-likely-than-not” that the position will be sustained upon examination. Judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions. The Company generally re-evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and recognizes an uncertain tax benefit when: (i) there is completion of tax audit; (ii) there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (iii) there is an expiration of the statute of limitations. An increase in our nominal tax rate of 1.0% would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 of approximately $25 million. New Accounting Standards In September 2011, updated accounting guidance was issued requiring additional disclosures about an employer’s participation in multiemployer retirement benefit plans. The amended disclosures, which are to be applied retrospectively for all prior periods presented, are effective for annual periods for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. As the new guidance is related to disclosure only, the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In September 2011, updated accounting guidance was issued which allows entities to perform a qualitative assessment on goodwill impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not (defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. This guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The implementation of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In June 2011, updated accounting guidance was issued which requires entities to present comprehensive income, which is currently presented in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders’ Equity, either as a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or as two separate but consecutive statements. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. As this new guidance is related to presentation only, the implementation in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 will not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In May 2011, updated accounting guidance was issued as a result of joint efforts by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the International Accounting Standards Board to develop a single, converged fair value framework on how to measure fair value and on what disclosures to provide about fair value measurements. The guidance is largely consistent with existing fair value measurement principles and is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company’s adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 will not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. ITEM 7A.
