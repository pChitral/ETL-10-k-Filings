97745,TMO,THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.,2006,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reference is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report. Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity The company develops and manufactures a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own core technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. In 2004, the company sold Spectra-Physics, its optical technologies segment which has been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements. The company’s continuing operations fall into two principal business segments: Life and Laboratory Sciences and Measurement and Control. Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government customers. 2005 2004 Revenues (Dollars in thousands) Life and Laboratory Sciences $ 1,960,153 74.4% $ 1,573,445 71.3% Measurement and Control 672,874 25.6% 632,550 28.7% $ 2,633,027 100% $ 2,205,995 100% The company’s revenues grew by 19% during 2005. The increase was due in part to acquisitions, net of divestitures. The strengthening of the dollar relative to non-U.S. currencies caused a decrease in reported revenues. In addition to the change in revenues caused by acquisitions, net of divestitures and currency translation, which are discussed below, sales increased 4% in 2005, primarily due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2005 and 2004. The principal acquisitions included Ionalytics Corporation, a provider of an ion-filtering device used with mass spectrometers, which was acquired in August 2005; the Kendro Laboratory Products division of SPX Corporation, a provider of a wide range of laboratory equipment for sample preparation, processing and storage, which was acquired in May 2005; Rupprecht and Patashnick Co., Inc. (R&P), a provider of continuous particulate monitoring instrumentation for the ambient air, emissions monitoring and industrial hygiene markets, which was acquired in April 2005; Niton LLC, a provider of portable X-ray analyzers to the metals, petrochemical and environmental markets, which was acquired in March 2005; InnaPhase Corporation, a supplier of laboratory information management systems for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets, which was acquired in September 2004; and US Counseling Services, Inc. (USCS), a supplier of equipment asset management services to the pharmaceutical, healthcare and related industries, which was acquired in April 2004. Financial Statement Index 24 Table of Contents In 2005, the company’s operating income and operating income margin were $263.5 million and 10.0%, respectively, compared with $237.5 million and 10.8%, respectively, in 2004. (Operating income margin is operating income divided by revenues.) The increase in operating income was due to higher revenues, productivity improvements including lower costs following restructuring actions and, to a lesser extent, price increases, offset in part by $54.8 million of higher amortization expense associated with acquisition-related intangible assets. Operating income margin decreased due to lower operating margins on revenue from acquisitions as a result of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Restructuring and other costs, net, (including charges to cost of revenues principally associated with the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition) reduced operating income by $30.3 million and $19.2 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The company’s effective tax rate was 30.6% and 15.8% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The provision for income taxes in 2005 includes $4.2 million for the estimated effect of tax audits of prior years in a non-U.S. country. This charge increased the effective tax rate in 2005 by 1.5 percentage points. The provision for income taxes in 2004 includes a benefit of $33.8 million associated with the settlement of U.S. and state tax audits of prior years. This benefit reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 13.0 percentage points. Income from continuing operations decreased to $198.3 million in 2005, from $218.4 million in 2004, primarily due to the effect of tax audits in both years and higher amortization expense, discussed above, offset in part by higher operating income from increased revenues as well as an increase in other income. During 2005, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $270.9 million, compared with $264.5 million in 2004. As of December 31, 2005, the company’s outstanding debt totaled $598.8 million, of which 65% is due in 2008 and thereafter. The company expects that its existing cash and short-term investments of $295.0 million as of December 31, 2005, and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available unsecured borrowings of up to $250 million under its existing 5-year revolving credit agreement and available unsecured borrowings under its 5-year euro facility are sufficient to meet its capital requirements for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, the company evaluates its estimates, including those related to equity investments, bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, warranty obligations, income taxes, pension costs, contingencies and litigation, restructuring and sale of businesses. The company bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Financial Statement Index 25 Table of Contents The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: (a) The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such allowances totaled $21.8 million at December 31, 2005. The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. (b) The company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence for differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage or demand vary significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required. (c) The company periodically evaluates goodwill for impairment using forecasts of discounted future cash flows. Goodwill totaled $1.97 billion at December 31, 2005. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment of goodwill may be necessary. (d) The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values and annual amortization expense from those established at the dates of acquisition. (e) The company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Other long-lived assets totaled $931.5 million at December 31, 2005, including $280.7 million of fixed assets. In testing a long-lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset-related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long-lived assets may be necessary. (f) In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change, the company’s revenue recognition would be affected. If fair value is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed. (g) In instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing. Financial Statement Index 26 Table of Contents (h) The company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or “elements.” The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately. (i) At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties and returns based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for warranty obligations of the company’s continuing operations totaled $33.5 million at December 31, 2005. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary. (j) The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance with an offset generally to goodwill as most of the tax attributes arose from acquisitions. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $63.5 million at December 31, 2005. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. (k) The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Accrued income taxes totaled $55.1 million at December 31, 2005. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the company’s tax provision would result. (l) The company estimates losses on contingencies and litigation for which a loss is probable and provides a reserve for losses that can be reasonably estimated. Should the ultimate losses on contingencies and litigation vary from estimates, adjustments to those reserves may be required. (m) One of the company’s U.S. subsidiaries and several non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for defined benefit plans totaled $16.1 million in 2005 and the company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $124 million at year-end 2005. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension expense of approximately $3 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $31 million. Financial Statement Index 27 Table of Contents (n) The company records restructuring charges for the cost of vacating facilities based on future lease obligations and expected sub-rental income. The company’s accrued restructuring costs for abandoned facilities in continuing operations totaled $9.2 million at December 31, 2005. Should actual cash flows associated with sub-rental income from vacated facilities vary from estimated amounts, adjustments may be required. (o) The company estimates the expected proceeds from any assets held for sale and, when necessary, records losses to reduce the carrying value of these assets to estimated realizable value. Should the actual or estimated proceeds, which would include post-closing purchase price adjustments, vary from current estimates, results could differ from expected amounts. Results of Operations 2005 Compared With 2004 Continuing Operations Sales in 2005 were $2.633 billion, an increase of $427.0 million (19%) from 2004. Sales increased $337.3 million (15%) due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $4.5 million in 2005. Aside from the effect of acquisitions, net of divestitures, and currency translation, revenues increased $94.2 million (4%) primarily due to increased demand, and to a lesser extent, price increases, as described by segment below. Growth was strong in Asia and moderate in North America and Europe. Operating Income Margin 2005 2004 Consolidated 10.0% 10.8% Operating income was $263.5 million in 2005, compared with $237.5 million in 2004. Operating income increased due to higher sales, including revenues from acquisitions, offset in part by the items discussed below. Operating income margin decreased to 10.0% in 2005 from 10.8% in 2004, primarily due to $54.8 million of higher amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets and $10.0 million of higher charges to cost of revenues, primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. These factors were offset in part by higher profitability from the increase in revenues and, to a lesser extent, price increases. In response to a downturn in markets served by the company and in connection with the company’s overall reorganization, restructuring actions were initiated in 2003 and, to a lesser extent, 2004 in a number of business units to reduce costs and redundancies, principally through headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities. Restructuring and other costs recorded in 2005 were primarily for reductions in staffing levels at existing businesses resulting from the integration of Kendro and consolidation of two facilities in Texas. The restructuring actions undertaken prior to 2005 were substantially complete at the end of 2004. The 2005 costs include charges associated with actions initiated prior to 2005 that could not be recorded until incurred and adjustments to previously provided reserves due to changes in estimates of amounts due for abandoned facilities, net of expected sub-tenant rental income. The company is continuing to evaluate potential restructuring actions that may be undertaken at Kendro or within existing businesses with which Kendro is being integrated. Such actions may include rationalization of product lines, consolidation of facilities and reductions in staffing levels. The cost of actions at Kendro businesses is being charged to the cost of the acquisition while the cost of actions at existing businesses being integrated with Kendro are charged to expense. The company has not finalized its plans for integrating Kendro with its existing business but expects that charges to expense will ultimately total $15 - $20 million, of which approximately $8 million has been recorded as of December 31, 2005. The company expects to finalize its restructuring plans for Kendro no later than one year from the date of acquisition. Financial Statement Index 28 Table of Contents In 2005, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $30.3 million, including charges to cost of revenues of $13.4 million primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company incurred $23.2 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses in connection with the integration of Kendro with existing businesses. In addition, the company recorded a gain of $8.0 million primarily from the sale of six abandoned buildings and a charge of $1.7 million principally for the writedown of a building held for sale. In 2004, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $19.2 million, including charges to cost of revenues of $3.4 million, consisting of $2.3 million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition of Jouan and $1.1 million of accelerated depreciation on fixed assets being abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $17.4 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. In addition, the company recorded a gain of $2.6 million on the sale of a product line and a loss of $1.0 million from the writedown of abandoned equipment and the sale of two abandoned buildings (Note 15). The restructuring actions initiated in 2005 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of 2005 and early 2006 of approximately $13 million, including $9 million in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment and $4 million in the Measurement and Control segment. The company expects to incur an additional $2 million of restructuring costs, primarily in 2006, for charges associated with these actions that cannot be recorded until incurred. Segment Results The company’s management evaluates operating segment performance based on measures that are not determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles including adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin. Adjusted operating income is segment operating income before certain charges to cost of revenues, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses these measures because they help management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation. Adjusted operating income margin is adjusted operating income divided by revenues. Life and Laboratory Sciences 2005 2004 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $ 1,960,153 $ 1,573,445 24.6% Operating Income Margin 12.1% 14.3% (2.2 ) Charges to cost of revenues 0.6% 0.2% 0.4 Restructuring and other costs, net 0.3% 0.4% (0.1 ) Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 3.7% 1.3% 2.4 Adjusted Operating Income Margin 16.7% 16.2% 0.5 Sales in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment increased $386.7 million (25%) to $1,960.2 billion in 2005. Sales increased $334.8 million due to the acquisitions of Kendro in May 2005, Niton in March 2005, InnaPhase in September 2004 and USCS in April 2004, net of divestitures, principally the point of care and rapid diagnostics business in September 2005. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $5.0 million in 2005. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $56.9 million (4%) due to higher broad-based demand from life science and industrial customers combined with strong market response to new products and, to a lesser extent, price increases. Growth was particularly strong in sales of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments and, to a lesser extent, anatomical pathology products. Financial Statement Index 29 Table of Contents Adjusted operating income margin was 16.7% in 2005 and 16.2% in 2004. The increase resulted from higher revenues including the effect of acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, price increases and cost reduction measures following restructuring actions. Charges to cost of revenues relate to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and increased in 2005 due to the Kendro acquisition. The increase in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was primarily due to the acquisition of Kendro, and, to a lesser extent, other businesses. Measurement and Control 2005 2004 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $ 672,874 $ 632,550 6.4% Operating Income Margin 9.5% 8.4% 1.1 Charges to cost of revenues 0.1% 0.0% 0.1 Restructuring and other costs, net 1.5% 1.0% 0.5 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 0.8% 0.5% 0.3 Adjusted Operating Income Margin 11.9% 9.9% 2.0 Sales in the Measurement and Control segment increased $40.3 million (6%) to $672.9 million in 2005. Sales increased $2.4 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $0.6 million in 2005. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $37.3 million (6%). The increase was primarily the result of higher demand from industrial customers, particularly from commodity markets including steel, petroleum and cement and customers purchasing instruments for use in environmental and security applications. Growth was strong in Asia and, to a lesser extent, in North America. The increase in revenues was, to a lesser extent, due to price increases. Adjusted operating income margin increased to 11.9% in 2005 from 9.9% in 2004. The increase resulted from higher sales volumes and cost reduction measures following restructuring actions. The increase in restructuring costs in 2005 primarily related to the consolidation of two facilities in Texas. The increase in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was due primarily to the acquisition of R&P. Other Income, Net The company reported other income, net, of $22.4 million and $21.7 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively (Note 4). Other income, net, includes interest income, interest expense, gain on investments, net, equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and other items, net. Interest income increased to $11.6 million in 2005 from $9.0 million in 2004, primarily due to higher invested cash balances following the sale of Spectra-Physics in July 2004 and, to a lesser extent, increased market interest rates, offset in part by cash used to fund acquisitions. Interest expense increased to $26.7 million in 2005 from $11.0 million in 2004, as a result of debt used to partially fund the Kendro acquisition and, to a lesser extent, higher rates associated with the company’s variable-rate debt. During 2005 and 2004, the company had gains on investments, net, of $35.3 million and $20.8 million, respectively. The gains included $28.9 million in 2005 and $9.6 million in 2004 from the sale of shares of Thoratec Corporation and a loss of $1.3 million in 2005 from the sale of shares of Newport Corporation, in addition to other gains from the company’s investment portfolio activity. The company obtained common shares of Thoratec as part of the sale of Thermo Cardiosystems Inc. in 2001 and obtained the shares of Newport as part of the sale of Spectra-Physics in 2004. The company no longer owns shares of Thoratec or Newport and does not expect to report material gains or losses from investments in 2006. Other income in 2005 and 2004 also includes net currency transaction gains and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Financial Statement Index 30 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes The company’s effective tax rate was 30.6% and 15.8% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The provision for income taxes in 2005 includes $4.2 million for the estimated effect of a tax audit of prior years in a non-U.S. country. The effect of this charge increased the effective tax rate in 2005 by 1.5 percentage points. The effective tax rate was lower in 2004 primarily due to $33.8 million of tax benefits associated with the completion of tax audits. The company’s federal tax returns and those of several subsidiaries were under audit for the period 1998 to 2000. In 2004 and early 2005, the IRS and the company reached final settlements of the audits and the company determined that previously unrecognized tax benefits were realizable. In addition, audits of state tax returns were also completed in 2004. This tax benefit reduced the company’s effective tax rate in 2004 by 13.0 percentage points. Contingent Liabilities At year-end 2005, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain lawsuits. An unfavorable outcome in either of the pending matters described under “Litigation and Related Contingencies” in Note 11 could materially affect the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2005, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 143-1, “Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations” to address the accounting for obligations associated with EU Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment. The directive requires EU member countries to adopt legislation to regulate the collection, treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic waste equipment. Under the directive, the waste management obligation for historical equipment (products put on the market on or prior to August 13, 2005) remains with the commercial user until the equipment is replaced. Depending upon the law adopted by the particular country, upon replacement, the waste management obligation for that equipment may be transferred to the producer of the related equipment. The user retains the obligation if they do not replace the equipment. FSP No. FAS 143-1 requires a commercial user to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” and related FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations” to waste obligations associated with historical equipment. The rules require that a liability be established for the retirement obligation with an offsetting increase to the carrying amount of the related asset. FSP No. FAS 143-1 is effective the later of the first reporting period ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of adoption of the law by the applicable EU member country. The issuance of FSP No. FAS 143-1 is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R) “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No. 123(R) amends SFAS No. 123 to require that companies record as expense the effect of equity-based compensation, including stock options over the applicable vesting period. The company currently discloses the effect on income that stock options would have were they recorded as expense. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires more extensive disclosures concerning stock options than required under current standards. The new rule applies to option grants made after adoption as well as options that are not vested at the date of adoption. SFAS No. 123(R) becomes effective in 2006. The company will apply the new standard using the modified prospective method in the first quarter of 2006. If the company had adopted this standard in 2005, the company’s net income for 2005 would have been $13.6 million (or $.08 per diluted share) lower than reported in 2005. The company expects that adoption of this standard will result in a reduction in net income of approximately $16 million (or $.10 per diluted share) during 2006. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs - an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,” which is the result of its efforts to converge U.S. accounting standards for inventories with International Accounting Standards. SFAS No. 151 requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage) to be recognized as current-period charges. It also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 will be effective for inventory costs incurred during 2006. The company does not expect the new standard to have a material effect on its financial statements. Financial Statement Index 31 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations The company had after-tax gains of $24.9 million in 2005 and $100.5 million in 2004 from the disposal of discontinued operations and $43.0 million of after-tax income in 2004 from discontinued operations. An after-tax gain of $16.8 million arose from the September 2005 sale of the company’s point of care and rapid diagnostics business for $53.1 million in cash. Revenues and pre-tax loss of the divested business totaled $29.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively, in 2004 and revenues and pre-tax income totaled $26.6 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in 2005 through the date of sale. Due to the immateriality of the operating results of this business relative to consolidated results, the company has not reclassified the historical results and accounts of this business to discontinued operations. In addition to the sale of this business, the company had after-tax gains aggregating $8.1 million in 2005 from the sale of abandoned real estate; additional proceeds from the sale of businesses divested prior to 2004, including the sale of abandoned real estate and post-closing adjustments; and the settlement of litigation and an arbitration award related to a divested business. In July 2004, the company completed the sale of its Optical Technologies segment, Spectra-Physics, to Newport. The company has reclassified the results of Spectra-Physics as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements. The company’s discontinued operations (Spectra-Physics) had revenues through the date of sale of $118.9 million in 2004. Net income of the discontinued operations through the date of sale in 2004 was $4.5 million, net of a tax provision of $2.2 million. As a result of the decision to sell Spectra-Physics, a previously unrecognized tax asset arising from the difference between the book and tax basis of Spectra-Physics became realizable and the company recorded a tax benefit as income from discontinued operations totaling $38.5 million in 2004. In addition, the company recorded a gain on the sale of Spectra-Physics of $45.9 million, net of a tax provision of $15.9 million. The tax returns of the company and its former Trex Medical and ThermoLase businesses were under audit by the IRS. In 2004 and early 2005, the IRS and the company reached final settlements of the audits and the company determined that previously unrecognized tax benefits associated with the divested businesses totaling $52.7 million were realizable. These tax benefits were recorded as a gain on the disposal of discontinued operations in 2004. In addition to the 2004 gains discussed above, the company had $1.3 million of after-tax gains and $0.6 million of tax benefits associated with discontinued operations. 2004 Compared With 2003 Continuing Operations Sales in 2004 were $2.206 billion, an increase of $306.6 million from 2003. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $92.1 million in 2004. Sales increased $134.4 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures, revenues increased $80.1 million, or 4%, primarily due to increased demand, as described by segment below. Operating Income Margin 2004 2003 Consolidated 10.8% 9.9% Operating income was $237.5 million in 2004, compared with $187.4 million in 2003. Operating income margin increased to 10.8% in 2004 from 9.9% in 2003. Operating income increased primarily due to lower restructuring and other costs, net, and, to a lesser extent, higher revenues in each segment in 2004. Operating income in 2004 and 2003 was reduced by additional charges associated with restructuring actions initiated in those and prior years and certain other costs, net (Note 15). The restructuring and other items totaled $19.2 million and $45.3 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and are discussed by segment below. Financial Statement Index 32 Table of Contents Restructuring actions were initiated in 2003 and, to a lesser extent, in 2004 in a number of business units to reduce costs and redundancies in response to a downturn in markets served by the company and in connection with the company’s overall reorganization, principally through headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities. The actions initiated in 2004 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in late 2004 and early 2005 of approximately $10 million, including $7 million in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment and $3 million in the Measurement and Control segment. The actions initiated in 2003 resulted in annual cost reductions beginning in late 2003 and early 2004 of approximately $11 million, including $7 million in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment and $4 million in the Measurement and Control segment. In 2004, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $19.2 million, including charges to cost of revenues of $3.4 million, consisting of $2.3 million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition of Jouan and $1.1 million of accelerated depreciation on fixed assets being abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $17.4 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. In addition, the company recorded a gain of $2.6 million on the sale of a product line and a loss of $1.0 million from the writedown of abandoned equipment and the sale of two abandoned buildings. In 2003, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $45.3 million, including $37.4 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities, employee retention and relocation expenses at businesses being consolidated. In addition, the company recorded net charges of $3.4 million, to write down the carrying value of fixed assets, primarily buildings held for sale, to expected disposal value, and $2.0 million, primarily for the writedown of goodwill in the test and measurement business to reduce the carrying value to disposal value, and for the writedown of assets at facilities being consolidated. These charges were offset by a gain of $2.1 million on the sale of a building and $0.4 million of net gains, primarily from the sale of a product line. The company also recorded charges to cost of revenues of $0.1 million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition (Note 15). Segment Results Life and Laboratory Sciences 2004 2003 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $ 1,573,445 $ 1,293,009 21.7% Operating Income Margin 14.3% 14.2% 0.1 Charges to cost of revenues 0.2% 0.0% 0.2 Restructuring and other costs, net 0.4% 1.7% (1.3 ) Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 1.3% 0.5% 0.8 Adjusted Operating Income Margin 16.2% 16.4% (0.2 ) Sales in the Life and Laboratory Sciences segment increased $280.4 million (22%) to $1.573 billion in 2004. Sales increased $153.1 million (12%) due to the acquisitions of InnaPhase in September 2004, USCS in April 2004, Jouan in December 2003 and LMSi in November 2003, net of product line divestitures. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $66.7 million (5%) in 2004. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $60.6 million, or 5%, due to higher demand. The increase in demand resulted principally in higher sales of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments and, to a lesser extent, new anatomical pathology products and laboratory informatics. The combination of new products and a rebound in sales to industrial markets along with strength in pharmaceutical demand contributed to the instrument sales growth, offset in part by lower revenues in Europe where the recovery of demand lagged the U.S. and Asia. The increase in revenues was offset in part by $5.6 million of lower revenue from rapid diagnostic tests due to a weak flu season in 2004 following a harsh season in 2003. Financial Statement Index 33 Table of Contents Adjusted operating income margin was 16.2% in 2004 and 16.4% in 2003. The inclusion of Jouan, USCS and LMSi, which have historically operated at lower profitability margins compared with the segment’s existing businesses contributed to the reduction and was offset in part by the impact of higher revenue. The decrease in restructuring and other costs, net, was due to the completion of several significant facility consolidation actions undertaken in 2003. The increase in amortization expense resulted from 2003 and 2004 acquisitions. Measurement and Control 2004 2003 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $ 632,550 $ 601,104 5.2% Operating Income Margin 8.4% 7.4% 1.0 Charges to cost of revenues 0.0% 0.0% 0.0 Restructuring and other costs, net 1.0% 1.7% (0.7 ) Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 0.5% 0.4% 0.1 Adjusted Operating Income Margin 9.9% 9.5% 0.4 Sales in the Measurement and Control segment increased $31.4 million (5%) to $632.6 million in 2004. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $25.4 million (4%) in 2004. Sales decreased $13.5 million (2%) due to divestitures, net of acquisitions. The principal divestiture was the segment’s test and measurement business, which it sold in October 2003. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures, revenues increased $19.5 million (3%). The increase was primarily the result of a rebound in demand for precision temperature-control products from the semiconductor industry and other process applications and, to a lesser extent, process instruments used by the materials industry and equipment used in metal production, particularly in China. Adjusted operating income margin increased to 9.9% in 2004 from 9.5% in 2003. The increase in operating income margin resulted from higher sales volumes and cost reduction measures following restructuring actions. The decrease in restructuring and other costs, net, was due to the completion of several significant facility consolidation actions undertaken in 2003. Other Income, Net The company reported other income, net, of $21.7 million and $35.2 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively (Note 4). Interest income decreased to $9.0 million in 2004 from $19.7 million in 2003, primarily due to lower invested cash balances following the acquisitions (net of divestitures) in late 2003 and 2004 and the use of cash for the repurchase and redemption of company securities. Interest expense decreased to $11.0 million in 2004 from $18.2 million in 2003, as a result of the repurchase and redemption of debentures. During 2004 and 2003, the company had gains on investments, net, of $20.8 million and $35.5 million, respectively. The gains included $9.6 million in 2004 and $16.3 million in 2003 from the sale of shares of Thoratec and $13.7 million in 2003 from the sale of shares of FLIR Systems, Inc. The company obtained an equity interest in FLIR as part of the acquisition of Spectra-Physics AB in 1999. Other income in 2004 and 2003 also includes currency transaction gains and losses and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. In addition, the company repurchased and redeemed debentures, resulting in a charge of $1.0 million during 2003. Financial Statement Index 34 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes The company’s effective tax rate was 15.8% and 21.3% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased in 2004 primarily due to $33.8 million of tax benefits associated with the completion of tax audits. The 2003 effective tax rate was favorably affected by $9.0 million of tax benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance due to expected utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards (Note 6) and $3.7 million of tax benefit from the sale of a business. These tax benefits reduced the company’s 2004 and 2003 effective tax rates by 13.0 percentage points and 5.7 percentage points, respectively. In addition, the company reduced its effective tax rate by 1.8 percentage points in 2003 through repatriation of cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries, which resulted in foreign tax credits. Income from Continuing Operations Income from continuing operations was $218.4 million in 2004, compared with $175.2 million in 2003. Results in both periods were affected by restructuring, gains on the sale of Thoratec shares and other items, discussed above. Discontinued Operations The company had after-tax gains of $100.5 million in 2004 and $27.3 million in 2003 from the disposal of discontinued operations. The company’s discontinued operations (Spectra-Physics) had revenues through the date of sale of $118.9 million and $197.8 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net income of the discontinued operations through the date of sale in 2004 was $4.5 million, net of a tax provision of $2.2 million. The company’s discontinued operations incurred a net loss in 2003 of $2.5 million, net of a tax benefit of $1.5 million. The improvement resulted from a rebound in the demand for lasers and photonics from microelectronics customers and other industrial markets served by Spectra-Physics. As a result of the decision to sell Spectra-Physics, a previously unrecognized tax asset arising from the difference between the book and tax basis of Spectra-Physics became realizable and the company recorded a tax benefit as income from discontinued operations totaling $38.5 million in 2004. In 2004, the company recorded a gain on the sale of Spectra-Physics of $45.9 million, net of a tax provision of $15.9 million. In 2004, the company recorded a gain on disposal of discontinued operations of $52.7 million as a result of the settlement of tax audits of businesses previously sold. In addition to the 2004 gains discussed above, the company had $1.3 million of after-tax gains and $0.6 million of tax benefits associated with discontinued operations. The 2003 gain consists of two pre-tax components and two tax components. In 2003, the company resolved several disputes and related claims that it had retained following the sale of businesses in its discontinued operations. In connection with the resolution of these matters on favorable terms relative to the damages estimated and amount of established reserves as well as the settlement of lease obligations, the company’s pre-tax gain recorded in prior years on disposal of the related businesses increased by $27.1 million. In 2003, the company also sold the last remaining business in discontinued operations, Peter Brotherhood Ltd., and received additional proceeds associated with businesses sold prior to 2003, including post-closing purchase price adjustments. The company recorded pre-tax gains from the disposal of discontinued operations of $8.3 million, substantially as a result of these transactions. The company recorded a tax provision of $13.2 million on the above gains and realized $5.1 million of additional tax benefits from the disposal of businesses sold prior to 2003, principally foreign tax credits. Financial Statement Index 35 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $562.2 million at December 31, 2005, compared with $890.9 million at December 31, 2004. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short-term available-for-sale investments of $295.0 million at December 31, 2005, compared with $512.3 million at December 31, 2004. The decreases result primarily from use of cash, cash equivalents, short-term available-for-sale investments and short-term debt to partially fund the Kendro acquisition. 2005 Cash provided by operating activities was $270.9 million during 2005, including $272.8 million provided by continuing operations and $1.9 million used by discontinued operations. Cash of $24.3 million was provided by an increase in other current liabilities, primarily accrued payroll and benefits due to the timing of payments, and deferred revenue, pending completion of obligations to customers. Income tax payments of approximately $13 million arose from taxes on gains on the sale of investments. The company contributed $10.9 million of funding to a U.K. pension plan in June 2005 (Note 5). Payments for restructuring actions of the company’s continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $19.7 million in 2005. In connection with restructuring actions undertaken by continuing operations, the company had accrued $17.9 million for restructuring costs at December 31, 2005. The company expects to pay approximately $7.4 million of this amount for severance, primarily through 2006, and $1.3 million for other costs, primarily through 2006. The balance of $9.2 million will be paid for lease obligations over the remaining terms of the leases, with approximately 65% to be paid through 2006 and the remainder through 2011. In addition, at December 31, 2005, the company had accrued $6.3 million for acquisition expenses. Accrued acquisition expenses included $2.6 million of severance and relocation obligations, which the company expects to pay primarily through 2006. The remaining balance primarily represents abandoned-facility payments that will be paid over the remaining terms of the leases through 2014. During 2005, the primary investing activities of the company’s continuing operations, excluding available-for-sale investment activities, included acquisitions and the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $933.2 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisitions of Niton, R&P, Kendro and Ionalytics (Note 2). The company expended $43.5 million for the purchases of property, plant and equipment and had proceeds from the sale of property, principally abandoned real estate, of $16.2 million. Investing activities of the company’s discontinued operations provided $65.6 million of cash in 2005, primarily from the sale of its point of care and rapid diagnostics business in September 2005 and the sale of a building of a previously divested business in August 2005. The company’s financing activities provided $390.9 million of cash during 2005, principally from the issuance of $250 million senior notes due in 2015 and a net increase in short-term borrowings of $119.0 million. The company received net proceeds of $27.2 million from the exercise of employee stock options during 2005. In February 2006, the company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of the company's common stock through February 28, 2007. The company repaid in full $570 million of borrowings under its bridge loan with cash and proceeds of new debt issuances described below. In May 2005, the company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5% senior notes (the Notes) due 2015, with an effective interest rate of 5.27% after including the impact of an interest swap arrangement. Under the Notes’ Indenture, the company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants. Also in May 2005, the company entered into an arrangement that provides the company an uncommitted line of credit of up to $250 million through a series of short-term money market loans funded on an ongoing basis in the secondary market. Such money market loans have maturity periods of overnight to 364 days and bear varying rates of interest based on the maturity date and market rate at the time of issuance. In May 2005, the company borrowed $250 million through three short-term loans under the money market arrangement with maturities of one week to three months. As of December 31, 2005, the company had repaid the borrowings under this arrangement. Financial Statement Index 36 Table of Contents In June 2005, the company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to 175 million euros. The facility carries interest at a Euribor rate plus 35 basis points. Under the facility, borrowings of one to six months duration may be drawn. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type. The financial covenants include interest coverage and debt-to-capital ratios. As of December 31, 2005, the company had outstanding borrowings under this facility of 105 million euros ($124 million) in two tranches with maturities in January 2006 and with a weighted average interest rate of 2.47%. The company has refinanced the outstanding borrowings and intends to refinance future maturities with additional borrowings under the facility to the extent necessary for liquidity purposes. 2004 Cash provided by operating activities was $264.5 million during 2004, including $250.0 million provided by continuing operations and $14.5 million provided by discontinued operations. Payments for restructuring actions of the company’s continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $25.8 million in 2004. Accounts receivable increased $27.6 million due primarily to higher sales of mass spectrometry and informatics product offerings. Inventories increased $21.5 million, due in part to increased production of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments in response to higher demand for these products. Cash provided by discontinued operations of $14.5 million principally represents the positive cash flow of Spectra-Physics, offset in part by the payment of retained liabilities from businesses sold prior to 2003, including settlement of litigation and lease payments on abandoned facilities. During 2004, the primary investing activities of the company’s continuing operations, excluding available-for-sale investment activities, included acquisitions for $143.0 million, net of cash acquired (Note 2) and the expenditure of $44.5 million for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, net of dispositions. Investing activities of discontinued operations provided $171.8 million of cash in 2004. In July 2004, the company sold Spectra-Physics to Newport Corporation for $300 million, including $200 million of initial cash proceeds. As a result of Newport assuming non-U.S. debt of Spectra-Physics that had earlier been expected to be retained by the company, and as a result of the post-closing adjustment process, the company refunded $25.1 million to Newport (Note 16). The company’s financing activities used $183.2 million of cash during 2004, including $183.7 million used by continuing operations. During 2004, the company expended $231.5 million to repurchase 8.4 million shares of the company’s common stock. The company received net proceeds of $57.6 million from the exercise of employee stock options during 2004. 2003 Cash provided by operating activities was $214.7 million during 2003, including $200.3 million provided by continuing operations and $14.4 million provided by discontinued operations. Payments for restructuring actions of the company’s continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $53.6 million in 2003. A decrease in inventories of $27.4 million resulted from efforts to improve working capital. Cash provided by discontinued operations of $14.4 million principally represents the positive cash flow of Spectra-Physics, offset in part by the payment of liabilities for businesses sold prior to 2003, including settlement of litigation and lease payments on abandoned facilities. During 2003, the primary investing activities of the company’s continuing operations, excluding available-for-sale investment activities, included acquisitions, the purchase of property, plant and equipment and collection of a note receivable. The company expended $134.9 million, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions (Note 2). The company expended $37.4 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment, net of dispositions. In April and June 2003, the company received aggregate cash payments of $75.6 million, including $69.1 million of principal payments, plus interest, from Trimble Navigation Limited as complete and early payment of Trimble’s note to the company. Financial Statement Index 37 Table of Contents The company’s financing activities used $663.6 million of cash during 2003, including $652.0 million for continuing operations. During 2003, the company’s continuing operations expended $369.1 million to reduce short-term notes payable. The company received net proceeds of $75.0 million from the exercise of employee stock options in 2003. During 2003, the company expended $269.1 million to redeem its debt securities (Note 10). In addition, the company expended $88.9 million to repurchase its debt and equity securities, of which $57.8 million was used to repurchase 3.0 million shares of the company’s common stock. The debt repurchases and redemptions have been made with the objective of reducing interest costs. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2003 - 2005 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $14.0 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold (Note 11). The balance relates to guarantees of the company’s own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the company’s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2005, which are principally for its continuing operations. Payments Due by Period or Expiration of Commitment 2007 and 2009 and 2011 and 2006 2008 2010 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments: Long-term debt obligations $ 646 $ 208,161 $ 403 $ 252,958 $ 462,168 Interest on fixed rate debt 15,010 27,092 25,000 56,250 123,352 Capital lease obligations 1,014 2,104 2,159 2,845 8,122 Operating lease obligations 39,525 52,701 30,405 69,957 192,588 Purchase obligations 82,351 492 1 – 82,844 Total contractual obligations 138,546 290,550 57,968 382,010 869,074 Other Commitments (not on the balance sheet): Letters of credit and bank guarantees 33,849 3,809 365 133 38,156 Surety bonds and other guarantees 5,930 935 – 7,334 14,199 Total other commitments 39,779 4,744 365 7,467 52,355 $ 178,325 $ 295,294 $ 58,333 $ 389,477 $ 921,429 This table excludes $133.0 million of other long-term liabilities, principally pension liabilities, $65.0 million of deferred income taxes and interest payments on $130.5 million of variable rate long-term debt, as these liabilities are not fixed amounts or are not subject to fixed payment schedules. Financial Statement Index 38 Table of Contents The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2006, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $46 to $51 million. The company believes that its existing resources, including cash and investments, future cash flow from operations and available borrowings under its existing 5-year revolving credit facilities, are sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward contracts to manage certain exposures to currencies. The company enters into forward currency-exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than its subsidiaries’ local currencies. The company does not engage in extensive currency hedging activities; however, the purpose of the company’s currency hedging activities is to protect the company’s local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The company’s forward currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euros, U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling and Canadian dollars. Income and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative currency agreements. Interest Rates Certain of the company’s short-term available-for-sale investments, long-term notes receivable and long-term obligations are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the rate at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% decrease in year-end 2005 and 2004 market interest rates would result in a net negative impact to the company of $9 million and $5 million, respectively, on the net fair value of its interest-sensitive financial instruments. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments. A 100-basis-point increase in 90-day LIBOR at December 31, 2005 and 2004, would increase the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by $1 million. A 100-basis-point increase in 90 day Euribor at December 31, 2005 would increase the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by $1 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the company’s reporting currency as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros, British pounds sterling and Japanese yen. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2005 and 2004 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $66 million and $106 million, respectively. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2005 and 2004 currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $0.7 million and $5.9 million, respectively. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Financial Statement Index 39 Table of Contents Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2005 and 2004 currency exchange rates would result in a negative impact of $2.7 million and $3.6 million, respectively, on the company’s net income. Equity Prices The company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in price. In addition, the company’s convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the company’s common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company’s available-for-sale investments and convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% decrease in year-end 2004 market equity prices would have resulted in a negative impact to the company of $10 million on the net fair value of its price-sensitive equity financial instruments, principally its available-for-sale investments. During 2005, the company sold substantially all of its available-for-sale equity investments (Note 4). A 10% increase in December 31, 2005 market equity prices would reduce the fair value of the company’s convertible obligations by $1 million.",2023-12-30 17:37:43.640007
97745,TMO,THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.,2007,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reference is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report. Thermo Electron Corporation and Fisher Scientific International Inc. announced on May 8, 2006 that the boards of directors of both companies had unanimously approved a definitive agreement to combine the two companies in a tax-free, stock-for-stock exchange. The Fisher businesses are a leading provider of products and services to the scientific research community and clinical laboratories. The Fisher businesses provide a suite of products and services to customers worldwide from biochemicals, cell-culture media and proprietary RNAi technology to rapid-diagnostic tests, safety products and other consumable supplies. Fisher had revenues of $5.4 billion in 2005. The transaction was approved by both companies’ shareholders, in separate meetings, held on August 30, 2006 and, following regulatory approvals, was completed on November 9, 2006. Fisher’s results are included in the accompanying financial statements from November 9, 2006. Following the merger, the company was renamed Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own core technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. In 2004, the company sold Spectra-Physics, its optical technologies segment which has been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements. Following the merger with Fisher, the company’s continuing operations fall into two principal business segments: Analytical Technologies and Laboratory Products and Services. Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government customers. Financial Statement Index 34 Table of Contents Revenues 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Analytical Technologies $ 2,425,821 64.0% $ 2,006,744 76.2% Laboratory Products and Services 1,406,637 37.1% 626,283 23.8 % Eliminations (40,841 ) (1.1 )% — — $ 3,791,617 100% $ 2,633,027 100% The company’s revenues grew by 44% during 2006, including 32% from the Fisher merger. The weakening of the dollar relative to non-U.S. currencies also caused an increase in reported revenues. In addition to the change in revenues caused by acquisitions, net of divestitures and currency translation, which are discussed below, sales increased 6% in 2006, primarily due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2006 and 2005. In addition to the merger with Fisher, the principal acquisitions included Cohesive Technologies Inc., a provider of advanced sample extraction and liquid chromatography products in December 2006; GV Instruments Limited, a manufacturer of isotope ratio mass spectrometers, which was acquired in July 2006; EGS Gauging, Inc., a provider of flat polymer web gauging products, which was acquired in June 2006; Ionalytics Corporation, a provider of an ion-filtering device used with mass spectrometers, which was acquired in August 2005; the Kendro Laboratory Products division of SPX Corporation, a provider of a wide range of laboratory equipment for sample preparation, processing and storage, which was acquired in May 2005; Rupprecht and Patashnick Co., Inc. (R&P), a provider of continuous particulate monitoring instrumentation for the ambient air, emissions monitoring and industrial hygiene markets, which was acquired in April 2005; and Niton LLC, a provider of portable X-ray analyzers to the metals, petrochemical and environmental markets, which was acquired in March 2005. In 2006, the company’s operating income and operating income margin were $242 million and 6.4%, respectively, compared with $263 million and 10.0%, respectively, in 2005. (Operating income margin is operating income divided by revenues.) The decrease in operating income and operating income margin was due to $125 million of pretax charges associated with the Fisher merger, described below, and $93 million of higher amortization expense, principally due to the Fisher merger. These items were offset in part by the inclusion of Fisher’s results from November 9, 2006 and higher profitability at existing businesses due to increased revenues, productivity improvements including lower costs following restructuring actions and, to a lesser extent, price increases. The company’s effective tax rate was 20.6% and 30.6% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to geographic changes in profits, in particular lower income in the United States due to charges associated with the Fisher merger, partially offset by non-deductible merger related costs. The provision for income taxes in 2005 includes $4 million for the estimated effect of tax audits of prior years in a non-U.S. country. This charge increased the effective tax rate in 2005 by 1.5 percentage points. Income from continuing operations decreased to $166 million in 2006, from $198 million in 2005, primarily due to the items discussed above that reduced operating income in 2006 and the inclusion of gains on the sale of investments in 2005, offset in part by a lower effective tax rate in 2006. During 2006, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $406 million, compared with $271 million in 2005. The increase resulted from improved cash flow at existing business and, to a lesser extent, cash flow from the Fisher business, net of $157 million in merger-related operating cash outflows including severance and retirement benefits as well as transaction costs incurred by Fisher that were paid subsequent to November 9, 2006. Financial Statement Index 35 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2006, the company’s outstanding debt totaled $2.7 billion, of which 77% is due in 2009 and thereafter. The company expects that its existing cash and short-term investments of $691 million as of December 31, 2006, and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available unsecured borrowing capacity of up to $635 million under its existing 5-year revolving credit agreement are sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, the company evaluates its estimates, including those related to equity investments, bad debts, sales returns, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets, warranty obligations, income taxes, pension costs, contingencies and litigation, equity-based compensation, restructuring and sale of businesses. The company bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: (a) Accounts Receivable The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such allowances totaled $45 million at December 31, 2006. The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. (b) Inventories The company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence for differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage or demand vary significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required. (c) Intangible Assets and Goodwill The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. A significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets that require that use of significant judgment in determining (i) fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Amortizable intangible assets totaled $6.18 billion at December 31, 2006. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values and annual amortization expense from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. The company reviews other intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Financial Statement Index 36 Table of Contents The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the value of the asset below its carrying amount using forecasts of discounted future cash flows. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $8.52 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2006. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary. (d) Other Long-Lived Assets The company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Other long-lived assets totaled $1.57 billion at December 31, 2006, including $1.26 billion of fixed assets. In testing a long-lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset-related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long-lived assets may be necessary. (e) Revenues In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change, the company’s revenue recognition would be affected. If fair value is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed. In instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing. The company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or “elements.” The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately. The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required. Financial Statement Index 37 Table of Contents (f) Warranty Obligations At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for warranty obligations of the company’s continuing operations totaled $45 million at December 31, 2006. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary. (g) Income Taxes The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income. The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance with an offset generally to goodwill as most of the tax attributes arose from acquisitions. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $195 million at December 31, 2006. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Accrued income taxes totaled $60 million at December 31, 2006. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the company’s tax provision would result. (h) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Reserves of Fisher, including environmental reserves, were initially recorded at their fair value and as such were discounted to their net present value. Additionally, we record receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. (i) Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Several of the company’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be Financial Statement Index 38 Table of Contents completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $16 million in 2006 and the company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $237 million at year-end 2006. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $101 million. (j) Equity-based Compensation The fair value of each stock option granted by the company is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock. The expected life of a grant is estimated using the simplified method for “plain vanilla” options as permitted by SAB 107. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock-based compensation. The compensation expense recognized for all equity-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures. If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required. (k) Restructuring Costs The company records restructuring charges for the cost of vacating facilities based on future lease obligations and expected sub-rental income. The company’s accrued restructuring costs for abandoned facilities in continuing operations totaled $12 million at December 31, 2006. Should actual cash flows associated with sub-rental income from vacated facilities vary from estimated amounts, adjustments may be required. (l) Assets Held for Sale The company estimates the expected proceeds from any assets held for sale and, when necessary, records losses to reduce the carrying value of these assets to estimated realizable value. Should the actual or estimated proceeds, which would include post-closing purchase price adjustments, vary from current estimates, results could differ from expected amounts. Financial Statement Index 39 Table of Contents Results of Operations 2006 Compared With 2005 Continuing Operations Sales in 2006 were $3.792 billion, an increase of $1.159 billion (44%) from 2005. Sales increased $978 million due to acquisitions (principally Fisher), net of divestitures. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $18 million in 2006. Aside from the effect of acquisitions, net of divestitures, and currency translation, revenues increased $163 million (6%) primarily due to increased demand, and to a lesser extent, price increases, as described by segment below. Growth was strong in Asia and Europe and moderate in North America. Operating Income Margin 2006 2005 Consolidated 6.4% 10.0% In 2006, operating income and operating income margin were $242 million and 6.4%, respectively, compared with $263 million and 10.0%, respectively, in 2005. The decrease in operating income and operating income margin was due to $125 million of pretax charges associated with the Fisher merger and $93 million of higher amortization expense, principally due to the Fisher merger. The $125 million of charges includes $73 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of the merger, $37 million of accelerated equity-based compensation due to a change in control occurring at the merger date and $15 million of in-process research and development at Fisher on the date of the merger. The unfavorable effect of these items was offset in part by the inclusion of Fisher’s results from November 9, 2006, through the end of the year and higher profitability at existing businesses due to increased revenue, productivity improvements, including lower costs following restructuring actions and, to a lesser extent, price increases. Restructuring and other costs were recorded in 2006 and 2005. Restructuring costs in 2005 were primarily for reductions in staffing levels at existing businesses resulting from the integration of Kendro and the consolidation of two facilities in Texas, as well as charges associated with actions initiated prior to 2005 that could not be recorded until incurred and adjustments to previously provided reserves due to changes in estimates of amounts due for abandoned facilities, net of expected sub-tenant rental income. Restructuring actions undertaken prior to 2005 were substantially complete at the end of 2004. Aside from the $15 million charge for in-process research and development existing at Fisher on the date of merger, discussed above, restructuring costs in 2006 include charges to close a plant in Massachusetts and consolidate its operations with those of an acquired Kendro facility in North Carolina, charges for consolidation of a U.K. facility into an existing factory in Germany, the move of manufacturing operations in New Mexico to other plants in the U.S. and Europe and remaining costs of prior actions. The company is finalizing its plan for potential restructuring actions that may be undertaken at Fisher or within existing businesses with which Fisher is being integrated. Such actions may include rationalization of product lines, consolidation of facilities and reductions in staffing levels. The cost of actions at Fisher businesses is being charged to the cost of the acquisition, while the cost of actions at existing businesses being integrated with Fisher is charged to expense. The company expects to finalize its restructuring plans for Fisher no later than one year from the date of merger. The company has finalized its plans for integrating Kendro with its existing business and expects that charges to expense will ultimately total approximately $16 million, of which $15 million has been recorded as of December 31, 2006, with the balance to be recorded as incurred. Also, the company has identified actions totaling $5 million that will be undertaken in 2007. The restructuring actions initiated in 2006 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of 2006 and early 2007 of approximately $11 million, including $6 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $5 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. Financial Statement Index 40 Table of Contents In 2006, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $123 million, including $78 million of charges to cost of revenues consisting of $75 million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition (principally Fisher) and $3 million for accelerated depreciation on fixed assets being abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $30 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. As discussed above, the company recorded a charge of $15 million for in-process research and development at Fisher on the merger date. In 2005, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $30 million, including charges to cost of revenues of $13 million primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company incurred $23 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses in connection with the integration of Kendro with existing businesses. In addition, the company recorded a gain of $8 million primarily from the sale of six abandoned buildings and a charge of $2 million principally for the writedown of a building held for sale (Note 15). Acquisition-related intangible assets of $7.2 billion arose from the merger with Fisher, including $5.9 billion of amortizable intangible assets. The company expects that amortization expense associated with the Fisher intangible assets will total approximately $470 million per year. In July 2006, the company acquired GV Instruments Limited (GVI), a UK-based provider of mass spectrometry instruments and accessories for $17.5 million, net of cash acquired and a post-closing refund of $4.6 million received in January 2007. Subsequent to the acquisition of GVI, the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) commenced an investigation of the transaction to determine whether it qualified for consideration under the UK Enterprise Act. On December 15, 2006, the OFT referred the transaction to the UK Competition Commission for further investigation under the Enterprise Act to determine whether the transaction results in, or may be expected to result in, a substantial lessening of competition within any market in the UK for goods or services, particularly gas isotope ratio mass spectrometers, thermal ionization mass spectrometers and multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers. Of GVI’s sales of $19 million in its fiscal 2006, $0.4 million were UK sales. The Competition Commission must prepare and publish its report within 24 weeks of the reference decision unless there are special reasons why it cannot do so. During the investigation, the company is subject to certain undertakings, which took effect October 2006, that require it not take any action that will lead to further integration of the GVI business with the company or otherwise impair the GVI business from competing independently. The company is cooperating with the Competition Commission’s investigation. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of this matter. Were the Competition Commission to require that the company divest of GVI, charges for impairment of assets could result. Goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisition of GVI totaled approximately $22 million.

The company uses these measures because they help management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Analytical Technologies 2006 2005 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $ 2,425,821 $ 2,006,744 21% Operating Income Margin 15.8% 14.2% 1.6 pts. Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $419 million to $2.426 billion in 2006. Sales increased $249 million due to the Fisher merger and other acquisitions, net of divestitures. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $10 million in 2006. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $160 million (8%) due to higher broad-based demand from life science and industrial customers combined with strong market response to new products and, to a lesser extent, price increases. Growth was particularly strong in sales of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments and, to a lesser extent, anatomical pathology products and equipment sold in commodity markets such as steel, petroleum and cement. Operating income margin was 15.8% in 2006 and 14.2% in 2005. The increase resulted from profit on incremental revenues, and to a lesser extent, price increases and productivity improvements, including cost-reduction measures following restructuring actions. Had stock option compensation been recorded as expense in 2005, the operating income margin in 2005 would have been 13.4%. Financial Statement Index 42 Table of Contents Laboratory Products and Services 2006 2005 Change (Dollars in thousands) Revenues $ 1,406,637 $ 626,283 125% Operating Income Margin 13.5% 13.8% (0.3) pts. Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $780 million to $1.407 billion in 2006. Sales increased $769 million due to the Fisher merger and other acquisitions, net of divestitures. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $8 million in 2006. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $3 million due to an increase in demand for laboratory equipment. Operating income margin decreased to 13.5% in 2006 from 13.8% in 2005, primarily due to the inclusion of stock option compensation in 2006 following adoption of SFAS No. 123R, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including restructuring actions. Had stock option compensation been recorded as expense in 2005, the operating income margin in 2005 would have been 13.1%. Other Income (Expense), Net The company reported other expense, net, of $33 million in 2006 and other income, net, of $22 million in 2005 (Note 4). Other income (expense), net, includes interest income, interest expense, gain on investments, net, equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and other items, net. Interest income increased to $16 million in 2006 from $12 million in 2005, primarily due to higher invested cash balances from operating cash flow and, to a lesser extent, increased market interest rates, offset in part by cash used to fund acquisitions. Interest expense increased to $52 million in 2006 from $27 million in 2005, as a result of debt assumed in the merger with Fisher and, to a lesser extent, a full year of debt used to partially fund the Kendro acquisition and higher rates associated with the company’s variable-rate debt. During 2006 and 2005, the company had gains on investments, net, of $1 million and $35 million, respectively. The gains included $29 million in 2005 from the sale of shares of Thoratec Corporation and a loss of $1 million in 2005 from the sale of shares of Newport Corporation, in addition to other gains from the company’s investment portfolio activity. The company obtained common shares of Thoratec as part of the sale of Thermo Cardiosystems Inc. in 2001 and obtained the shares of Newport as part of the sale of Spectra-Physics in 2004. Following the sale of shares in 2005, the company no longer owns shares of Thoratec or Newport. Other income in 2006 and 2005 also includes net currency transaction gains and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Provision for Income Taxes The company’s effective tax rate was 20.6% and 30.6% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to geographic changes in profits, in particular lower income in the United States due to charges associated with the Fisher merger, partially offset by non-deductible merger related costs. The provision for income taxes in 2005 includes $4 million for the estimated effect of a tax audit of prior years in a non-U.S. country. The effect of this charge increased the effective tax rate in 2005 by 1.5 percentage points. Financial Statement Index 43 Table of Contents Contingent Liabilities At year-end 2006, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. As described under “Litigation and Related Contingencies” in Note 11, an unfavorable outcome in the matters described therein could materially affect the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Recent Accounting Pronouncements As of January 1, 2006, the company adopted SFAS No. 123R “Share-based Payment.” The standard requires that companies record as expense the effect of equity-based compensation over the applicable vesting period. The company adopted the standard using the modified prospective application transition method. Under this transition method, the compensation cost recognized beginning January 1, 2006 includes compensation cost for (i) all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (ii) all share-based payments granted subsequent to December 31, 2005 based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Compensation cost is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period or, for 2006 grants, to the retirement date for retirement eligible employees, if earlier. Prior period amounts have not been restated. The company recorded $62 million of pre-tax expense in 2006 for stock options, including $34 million the recognition of which was accelerated into 2006 as a result of the merger with Fisher causing a change in control. The stock option costs of $62 million included $7 million in cost of revenues, $51 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and $4 million in research and development expenses. As of December 31, 2006, the company had $133 million ($85 million, net of tax) of total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested equity awards, including unvested awards at Fisher on the date of merger that converted into awards exercisable over various vesting periods into shares of company common stock. The cost is expected to be recognized over approximately 3 years. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefits Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R.” SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability. The company adopted SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006. The effect of adoption resulted in increases in total assets of $14 million, total liabilities of $9 million and stockholders’ equity of $5 million. In July 2006, the FASB released FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (FIN No. 48). FIN No. 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. Under FIN No. 48, the financial statements will reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities’ full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts, but without discounting for the time value of money. FIN No. 48 also revises disclosure requirements and introduces a prescriptive, annual, tabular roll-forward of the unrecognized tax benefits. FIN No. 48 will become effective in the first quarter of 2007. The company does not expect the effect of adoption to be material. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for the company in 2008. The company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting SFAS No. 157. Financial Statement Index 44 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations The company’s discontinued operations reported after-tax income of $0.5 million in 2006, representing the results of two small Fisher businesses held for sale. The company had after-tax gains of $2 million in 2006 and $25 million in 2005 from the disposal of discontinued operations. The 2006 gains represent additional proceeds from the sale of several businesses prior to 2004, net of a charge for the settlement of an indemnification claim that arose from a divested business. An after-tax gain of $17 million arose from the September 2005 sale of the company’s point of care and rapid diagnostics business for $53 million in cash. Revenues and pre-tax loss of the divested business totaled $30 million and $1 million, respectively, in 2004 and revenues and pre-tax income totaled $27 million and $1 million, respectively, in 2005 through the date of sale. Due to the immateriality of the operating results of this business relative to consolidated results, the company has not reclassified the historical results and accounts of this business to discontinued operations. In addition to the sale of this business, the company had after-tax gains aggregating $8 million in 2005 from the sale of abandoned real estate; additional proceeds from the sale of businesses divested prior to 2004, including the sale of abandoned real estate and post-closing adjustments; and the settlement of litigation and an arbitration award related to a divested business. 2005 Compared With 2004 Continuing Operations Sales in 2005 were $2.633 billion, an increase of $427 million (19%) from 2004. Sales increased $337 million (15%) due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $4.5 million in 2005. Aside from the effect of acquisitions, net of divestitures, and currency translation, revenues increased $94 million (4%) primarily due to increased demand, and to a lesser extent, price increases, as described by segment below. Growth was strong in Asia and moderate in North America and Europe. Operating Income Margin 2005 2004 Consolidated 10.0% 10.8% Operating income was $263 million in 2005, compared with $238 million in 2004. Operating income increased due to higher sales, including revenues from acquisitions, offset in part by the items discussed below. Operating income margin decreased to 10.0% in 2005 from 10.8% in 2004, primarily due to $55 million of higher amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets and $10 million of higher charges to cost of revenues, primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. These factors were offset in part by higher profitability from the increase in revenues and, to a lesser extent, price increases. In 2005, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $30 million, including charges to cost of revenues of $13 million, primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company incurred $23 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses in connection with the integration of Kendro with existing businesses. In addition, the company recorded a gain of $8 million, primarily from the sale of six abandoned buildings and a charge of $2 million, principally for the writedown of a building held for sale. In 2004, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $19 million, including charges to cost of revenues of $3 million, consisting of $2 million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition of Jouan and $1 million of accelerated depreciation on fixed assets being abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $17 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. In addition, the company recorded a gain of $3 million on the sale of a product line and a loss of $1 million from the writedown of abandoned equipment and the sale of two abandoned buildings.

Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $192 million (11%) to $2.007 billion in 2005. Sales increased $96 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $4 million in 2005. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $100 million (6%) due to higher broad-based demand from life science and industrial customers combined with strong market response to new products and, to a lesser extent, price increases. Growth was particularly strong in sales of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments; and, to a lesser extent, equipment sold to commodity markets including steel, petroleum and cement; instruments used in environmental and security applications; and anatomical pathology products. Operating income margin was 14.2% in 2005 and 13.1% in 2004. The increase resulted from profit on incremental revenue, and to a lesser extent, price increases and productivity improvements, including cost reduction measures following restructuring actions.

Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $235 million (60%) to $626 million in 2005. Sales increased $241 million due to acquisitions (principally Kendro), net of divestitures. Currency translation had an immaterial effect on revenues. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation, revenues decreased $6 million (1.5%) due to slightly lower demand for laboratory equipment used for sample preparation, processing and storage. Operating income margin increased to 13.8% in 2005 from 10.9% in 2004. The increase resulted from inclusion of higher margin revenues from Kendro as well as productivity improvements, including cost reduction measures following restructuring actions. Other Income, Net The company reported other income, net, of $22 million both in 2005 and 2004 (Note 4). Interest income increased to $12 million in 2005 from $9 million in 2004, primarily due to higher invested cash balances following the sale of Spectra-Physics in July 2004 and, to a lesser extent, increased market interest rates, offset in part by cash used to fund acquisitions. Interest expense increased to $27 million in 2005 from $11 million in 2004, as a result of debt used to partially fund the Kendro acquisition and, to a lesser extent, higher rates associated with the company’s variable-rate debt. During 2005 and 2004, the company had gains on investments, net, of $35 million and $21 million, respectively. The gains included $29 million in 2005 and $10 million in 2004 from the sale of shares of Thoratec and a loss of $1 million in 2005 from the sale of shares of Newport, in addition to other gains from the company’s investment portfolio activity. Other income in 2005 and 2004 also includes net currency transaction gains and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Provision for Income Taxes The company’s effective tax rate was 30.6% and 15.8% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The provision for income taxes in 2005 includes $4 million for the estimated effect of a tax audit of prior years in a non-U.S. country. The effect of this charge increased the effective tax rate in 2005 by 1.5 percentage points. The effective tax rate was lower in 2004 primarily due to $34 million of tax benefits associated with the completion of tax audits. The company’s federal tax returns and those of several subsidiaries were under audit for the period 1998 to 2000. In 2004 and early 2005, the IRS and the company reached final settlements of the audits and the company determined that previously unrecognized tax benefits were realizable. In addition, audits of state tax returns were also completed in 2004. This tax benefit reduced the company’s effective tax rate in 2004 by 13.0 percentage points. Discontinued Operations The company had after-tax gains of $25 million in 2005 and $100 million in 2004 from the disposal of discontinued operations and $43 million of after-tax income in 2004 from discontinued operations. An after-tax gain of $17 million arose from the September 2005 sale of the company’s point of care and rapid diagnostics business for $53 million in cash. Revenues and pre-tax loss of the divested business totaled $30 million and $1 million, respectively, in 2004 and revenues and pre-tax income totaled $27 million and $1 Financial Statement Index 47 Table of Contents million, respectively, in 2005 through the date of sale. In addition to the sale of this business, the company had after-tax gains aggregating $8 million in 2005 from the sale of abandoned real estate; additional proceeds from the sale of businesses divested prior to 2004, including the sale of abandoned real estate and post-closing adjustments; and the settlement of litigation and an arbitration award related to a divested business. In July 2004, the company completed the sale of its Optical Technologies segment, Spectra-Physics, to Newport. The company has reclassified the results of Spectra-Physics as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements. The company’s discontinued operations (Spectra-Physics) had revenues through the date of sale of $119 million in 2004. Net income of the discontinued operations through the date of sale in 2004 was $4.5 million, net of a tax provision of $2 million. As a result of the decision to sell Spectra-Physics, a previously unrecognized tax asset arising from the difference between the book and tax basis of Spectra-Physics became realizable and the company recorded a tax benefit as income from discontinued operations totaling $38.5 million in 2004. In addition, the company recorded a gain on the sale of Spectra-Physics of $46 million, net of a tax provision of $16 million. The tax returns of the company and its former Trex Medical and ThermoLase businesses were under audit by the IRS. In 2004 and early 2005, the IRS and the company reached final settlements of the audits and the company determined that previously unrecognized tax benefits associated with the divested businesses totaling $53 million were realizable. These tax benefits were recorded as a gain on the disposal of discontinued operations in 2004. In addition to the 2004 gains discussed above, the company had $1 million of after-tax gains and $1 million of tax benefits associated with discontinued operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $1.507 billion at December 31, 2006, compared with $562 million at December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to working capital acquired in the merger with Fisher. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short-term available-for-sale investments of $691 million at December 31, 2006, compared with $295 million at December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to cash acquired in the merger with Fisher. 2006 Cash provided by operating activities was $406 million during 2006, including $407 million provided by continuing operations. A reduction in current liabilities used cash of $148 million, primarily as a result of merger-related payments made following completion of the transaction totaling $157 million, including executive severance and retirement benefits, and transaction costs incurred by Fisher. Cash of $32 million was provided by collections on accounts receivable. Payments for restructuring actions of the company’s continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $30 million during 2006. In connection with restructuring actions undertaken by continuing operations, the company had accrued $20 million for restructuring costs at December 31, 2006. The company expects to pay approximately $7 million of this amount for severance and retention, primarily through 2007, and $1 million for other costs, primarily through 2007. The balance of $12 million will be paid for lease obligations over the remaining terms of the leases, with approximately 67% to be paid through 2007 and the remainder through 2013. In addition, at December 31, 2006, the company had accrued $35 million for acquisition expenses. Accrued acquisition expenses included $30 million of severance and relocation obligations, which the company expects to pay primarily through 2007. The remaining balance primarily represents abandoned-facility payments that will be paid over the remaining terms of the leases through 2014. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents During 2006, the primary investing activities of the company’s continuing operations, excluding available-for-sale investment activities, included acquisitions, the purchase of property, plant and equipment and the sale of product lines. Cash acquired in the merger with Fisher totaled $360 million, net of transaction costs. The company expended $132 million on acquisitions and $77 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company partially liquidated assets totaling $40 million in a Fisher retirement trust to fund payments that were due to former Fisher executives following the merger. The company had proceeds from the sale of product lines of $9 million. Investing activities of the company’s discontinued operations provided $5 million of cash during 2006, primarily additional proceeds from a business divested prior to 2004. In January 2007, the company acquired two businesses for an aggregate of $20 million. In February 2007, Newport repaid in full its note payable to the company, totaling $48 million. The company’s financing activities used $260 million of cash during 2006, principally for the repurchase of $300 million of the company’s common stock and the repayment of $335 million of debt, offset in part by short-term borrowing and proceeds of stock option exercises. The company increased short-term borrowings by $177 million in 2006. The company had proceeds of $180 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $17 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. In 2006, the company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $300 million of the company’s common stock through February 28, 2007. At December 31, 2006, no remaining authorization existed for future repurchases. In February 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the company’s common stock through February 28, 2008. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2007, such expenditures will approximate $240 - $260 million. On August 29, 2006, the company negotiated a new $1 billion revolving credit agreement that became effective at the time of the merger with Fisher and replaced the company’s existing credit facilities. At December 31, 2006, borrowings of $635 million were available under the revolving credit agreement. The company believes that its existing resources, including cash and investments, future cash flow from operations, and available borrowings under its existing revolving credit facilities, are sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2005 Cash provided by operating activities was $271 million during 2005, including $273 million provided by continuing operations and $2 million used by discontinued operations. Cash of $24 million was provided by an increase in other current liabilities, primarily accrued payroll and benefits due to the timing of payments, and deferred revenue, pending completion of obligations to customers. Income tax payments of approximately $13 million arose from taxes on gains on the sale of investments. The company contributed $11 million of funding to a U.K. pension plan in June 2005 (Note 5). Payments for restructuring actions of the company’s continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $20 million in 2005. During 2005, the primary investing activities of the company’s continuing operations, excluding available-for-sale investment activities, included acquisitions and the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $933 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisitions of Niton, R&P, Kendro and Ionalytics (Note 2). The company expended $44 million for the purchases of property, plant and equipment and had proceeds from the sale of property, principally abandoned real estate, of $16 million. Investing activities of the company’s discontinued operations provided $66 million of cash in 2005, primarily from the sale of its point of care and rapid diagnostics business in September 2005 and the sale of a building of a previously divested business in August 2005. The company’s financing activities provided $391 million of cash during 2005, principally from the issuance of $250 million senior notes due in 2015 and a net increase in short-term borrowings of $119 million. The company received net proceeds of $27 million from the exercise of employee stock options during 2005. The company repaid in full $570 million of borrowings under its bridge loan with cash and proceeds of new debt issuances described below. In May 2005, the company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5% senior notes (the Notes) due 2015, with an effective interest rate of 5.27% after including the impact of an interest rate swap arrangement. Under the Notes’ Indenture, the company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants. Financial Statement Index 49 Table of Contents Also in May 2005, the company entered into an arrangement that provides the company an uncommitted line of credit of up to $250 million through a series of short-term money market loans funded on an ongoing basis in the secondary market. Such money market loans have maturity periods of overnight to 364 days and bear varying rates of interest based on the maturity date and market rate at the time of issuance. In May 2005, the company borrowed $250 million through three short-term loans under the money market arrangement with maturities of one week to three months. As of December 31, 2005, the company had repaid the borrowings under this arrangement. In June 2005, the company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility with a bank group that provided up to 175 million euros. The facility carried interest at a Euribor rate plus 35 basis points. As of December 31, 2005, the company had outstanding borrowings under this facility of 105 million euros ($124 million) in two tranches with maturities in January 2006 and with a weighted average interest rate of 2.47%. The facility was terminated in 2006. 2004 Cash provided by operating activities was $265 million during 2004, including $250 million provided by continuing operations and $15 million provided by discontinued operations. Payments for restructuring actions of the company’s continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $26 million in 2004. Accounts receivable increased $34 million due primarily to higher sales of mass spectrometry and informatics product offerings. Inventories increased $21 million, due in part to increased production of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments in response to higher demand for these products. Cash provided by discontinued operations of $15 million principally represents the positive cash flow of Spectra-Physics, offset in part by the payment of retained liabilities from businesses sold prior to 2003, including settlement of litigation and lease payments on abandoned facilities. During 2004, the primary investing activities of the company’s continuing operations, excluding available-for-sale investment activities, included acquisitions for $143 million, net of cash acquired (Note 2) and the expenditure of $44 million for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, net of dispositions. Investing activities of discontinued operations provided $172 million of cash in 2004. In July 2004, the company sold Spectra-Physics to Newport Corporation for $300 million, including $200 million of initial cash proceeds. As a result of Newport assuming non-U.S. debt of Spectra-Physics that had earlier been expected to be retained by the company, and as a result of the post-closing adjustment process, the company refunded $25 million to Newport (Note 16). The company’s financing activities used $183 million of cash during 2004, including $184 million used by continuing operations. During 2004, the company expended $232 million to repurchase 8.4 million shares of the company’s common stock. The company received net proceeds of $58 million from the exercise of employee stock options during 2004. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2004 - 2006 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $13.7 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the company’s own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 50 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the company’s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2006. Payments Due by Period or Expiration of Commitment 2007 2008 and 2009 2010 and 2011 2012 and Thereafter Total (In thousands) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments: Debt principal, including short term debt (a) $ 478,912 $ 132,861 $ 591 $ 2,036,610 $ 2,648,974 Interest (b) 108,407 199,954 191,590 732,543 1,232,494 Capital lease obligations 4,386 5,944 2,743 1,956 15,029 Operating lease obligations 92,111 134,308 75,574 85,089 387,082 Unconditional purchase obligations (c) 110,773 7,103 984 111 118,971 Letters of credit and bank guarantees 70,014 6,303 151 160 76,628 Surety bonds and other guarantees 28,832 — — 8,358 37,190 Other (d) 15,350 — — — 15,350 $ 908,785 $ 486,473 $ 271,633 $ 2,864,827 $ 4,531,718 (a) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for debt and do not include any deferred issuance costs. (b) For the purpose of this calculation, amounts assume interest rates on floating rate obligations remain unchanged from levels at December 31, 2006, throughout the life of the obligation. (c) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (d) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. The company holds an investment in a joint venture whereby the current party has a right to require the company to purchase its interest beginning in 2008. The purchase price is based on a multiple of pretax earnings. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2007, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $240 to $260 million. Financial Statement Index 51 Table of Contents In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business-Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward contracts to manage certain exposures to currencies. The company enters into forward currency-exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than its subsidiaries’ local currencies. The company does not engage in extensive currency hedging activities; however, the purpose of the company’s currency hedging activities is to protect the company’s local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The company’s forward currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euros, U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars and Swiss francs. Income and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative currency agreements. Interest Rates Certain of the company’s short-term available-for-sale investments, long-term notes receivable and long-term obligations are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the rate at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% decrease in year-end 2006 and 2005 market interest rates would result in a net negative impact to the company of $84 million and $9 million, respectively, on the net fair value of its interest-sensitive financial instruments. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments. A 100-basis-point increase in 90-day LIBOR at December 31, 2006 and 2005, would increase the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by $9 million and $1 million, respectively. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the company’s reporting currency as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros, British pounds sterling and Japanese yen. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2006 and 2005 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $324 million and $66 million, respectively. Financial Statement Index 52 Table of Contents The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2006 and 2005 currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $7 million and $1 million, respectively. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2006 and 2005 currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $5 million and $3 million, respectively, on the company’s net income. Equity Prices The company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in price. In addition, the company’s convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the company’s common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company’s available-for-sale investments and convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. The company assumed Fisher’s convertible debt at the date of the merger. A 10% increase in year-end 2006 and 2005 market equity prices would reduce the fair value of the company’s convertible obligations by $128 million and $1 million, respectively.",2023-12-30 17:37:56.713327
97745,TMO,THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.,2008,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reference is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report. Thermo Electron Corporation and Fisher Scientific International Inc. completed a merger of the two companies on November 9, 2006 in a tax-free, stock-for-stock exchange. The Fisher businesses are a leading provider of products and services to the scientific research community and clinical laboratories. The Fisher businesses provide a suite of products and services to customers worldwide from biochemicals, cell-culture media and proprietary RNAi technology to rapid-diagnostic tests, safety products and other consumable supplies. Fisher had revenues of $5.4 billion in 2005. Fisher’s results are included in the accompanying financial statements from November 9, 2006. Following the merger, the company was renamed Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. To assist in year over year comparisons, certain information in the following discussion of the company’s results of operations has been presented on a pro forma basis, as if the two companies had been combined from the beginning of 2006. Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own core technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. Following the merger with Fisher, the company’s continuing operations fall into two principal business segments: Analytical Technologies and Laboratory Products and Services. Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government customers. Financial Statement Index 35 Table of Contents (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Revenues: Analytical Technologies $ 4,256.0 43.7% $ 2,425.8 64.0% Laboratory Products and Services 5,842.2 59.9% 1,406.6 37.1% Eliminations (351.8 ) (3.6)% (40.8 ) (1.1)% $ 9,746.4 100% $ 3,791.6 100% Sales in 2007 were $9.75 billion, an increase of $5.95 billion from 2006. Sales increased principally due to the merger with Fisher as well as other acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, increased demand and the favorable effect of currency translation. If the merger with Fisher had occurred on January 1, 2006, revenues would have increased $876 million (10%), over pro forma 2006 revenues. Aside from the effects of acquisitions and divestitures made by both companies and currency translation (discussed in total and by segment below), revenues increased over pro forma 2006 revenues by $507 million due to higher revenues at existing businesses as a result of increased demand, discussed below, and, to a lesser extent, price increases. The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2007 and 2006. In addition to the merger with Fisher, the principal acquisitions included La-Pha-Pack, a manufacturer and provider of chromatography consumables and related accessories in December 2007; Priority Solutions International, a third-party provider to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries in October 2007; NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., a supplier of UV-Vis spectrophotometry and fluorescence scientific instruments in October 2007; Qualigens Fine Chemicals, a chemical manufacturer and supplier in September 2007 and Cohesive Technologies Inc., a provider of advanced sample extraction and liquid chromatography products in December 2006. In 2007, the company’s operating income and operating income margin were $974 million and 10.0%, respectively, compared with $242 million and 6.4%, respectively, in 2006. (Operating income margin is operating income divided by revenues.) The increase in operating income was due to the Fisher merger and, to a lesser extent, higher profitability at existing businesses resulting from incremental revenues, price increases and productivity improvements and $125 million of pre-tax charges in 2006 associated with the Fisher merger, described below. These increases were offset in part by $400 million of higher amortization expense as a result of acquisition-related intangible assets from the Fisher merger and other acquisitions. The company’s effective tax rate was 11.5% and 20.6% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The tax provision in 2007 was favorably affected by a one-time benefit of enacted reductions in tax rates in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Canada and Germany on the company’s deferred tax balances. This benefit totaled $32 million. In addition to the impact of this item, the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2007, compared with 2006, was primarily due to geographic changes in profits, in particular lower income in the United States due to charges and amortization associated with the Fisher merger, together with the impact of an increased U.S. tax credit for foreign taxes, an enhanced tax credit for qualifying U.S. research costs and growth in lower tax regions such as Asia. Income from continuing operations increased to $780 million in 2007 from $166 million in 2006, primarily due to the items discussed above that increased operating income in 2007 and the one-time tax benefit discussed above, offset in part by higher interest expense, primarily associated with debt assumed in the Fisher merger. During 2007, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $1.48 billion, compared with $406 million for 2006. The increase resulted from cash flow from the Fisher businesses and, to a lesser extent, improved cash flow at existing businesses. Cash flow from operations in 2007 and 2006 were net of $78 million and $157 million, respectively, in merger-related operating cash outflows, including severance and retirement benefits as well as transaction costs incurred by Fisher that were paid subsequent to November 9, 2006. Financial Statement Index 36 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2007, the company’s outstanding debt totaled $2.20 billion, of which 93% is due in 2010 and thereafter. The company expects that its existing cash and short-term investments of $639 million as of December 31, 2007, and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available unsecured borrowing capacity of up to $955 million under its existing 5-year revolving credit agreement are sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, the company evaluates its estimates, including those related to equity investments, bad debts, sales returns, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets, warranty obligations, income taxes, pension costs, contingencies and litigation, stock-based compensation, restructuring and sale of businesses. The company bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: (a) Accounts Receivable The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such allowances totaled $49 million at December 31, 2007. The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. (b) Inventories The company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence for differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required. (c) Intangible Assets and Goodwill The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. A significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets that require that use of significant judgment in determining (i) fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Amortizable intangible assets totaled $5.83 billion at December 31, 2007. The company reviews other intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in Financial Statement Index 37 Table of Contents cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the value of the asset below its carrying amount using forecasts of discounted future cash flows. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $8.71 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2007. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary. (d) Other Long-Lived Assets The company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Other long-lived assets totaled $1.67 billion at December 31, 2007, including $1.27 billion of fixed assets. In testing a long-lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset-related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long-lived assets may be necessary. (e) Revenues In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change, the company’s revenue recognition would be affected. If fair value is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed. In instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing. The company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or “elements.” The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements. In the event Financial Statement Index 38 Table of Contents VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately. The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required. (f) Warranty Obligations At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for warranty obligations of the company’s continuing operations totaled $51 million at December 31, 2007. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary. (g) Income Taxes In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized. The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income. The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance with an offset generally to goodwill as most of the tax attributes arose from acquisitions. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $197 million at December 31, 2007. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions Financial Statement Index 39 Table of Contents in which it operates. Accrued income taxes totaled $64 million at December 31, 2007. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the company’s tax provision or goodwill would result. (h) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Reserves of Fisher as of the merger date, including environmental reserves, were initially recorded at their fair value and as such were discounted to their net present value. Additionally, we record receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. (i) Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Several of the company’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $19 million in 2007 and the company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $170 million at year-end 2007. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $97 million. (j) Stock-based Compensation The fair value of each stock option granted by the company is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock. The expected lives of grants through 2007 were estimated using the simplified method for “plain vanilla” options as permitted by SAB 107. Thereafter, historical data on exercise patterns will become the basis for determining the expected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock-based compensation. The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures. If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required. Financial Statement Index 40 Table of Contents (k) Restructuring Costs The company records restructuring charges for the cost of vacating facilities based on future lease obligations and expected sub-rental income. The company’s accrued restructuring costs for abandoned facilities in continuing operations totaled $5 million at December 31, 2007. Should actual cash flows associated with sub-rental income from vacated facilities vary from estimated amounts, adjustments may be required. (l) Assets Held for Sale The company estimates the expected proceeds from any assets held for sale and, when necessary, records losses to reduce the carrying value of these assets to estimated realizable value. Should the actual or estimated proceeds, which would include post-closing purchase price adjustments, vary from current estimates, results could differ from expected amounts. Results of Operations 2007 Compared With 2006 Continuing Operations Sales in 2007 were $9.75 billion, an increase of $5.95 billion from 2006. Sales increased principally due to the merger with Fisher as well as other acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, increased demand and the favorable effect of currency translation. If the merger with Fisher had occurred on January 1, 2006, revenues would have increased $876 million (10%) over pro forma 2006 revenues, including increases of a) $128 million due to acquisitions made by the combined companies, net of divestitures, b) $241 million due to the favorable effect of currency translation and c) $507 million due to higher revenues at existing businesses as a result of increased demand and, to a lesser extent, price increases. Growth was particularly strong in Asia and, to a lesser extent, North America and more moderate in Europe. In 2007, operating income and operating income margin were $974 million and 10.0%, respectively, compared with $242 million and 6.4%, respectively, in 2006. The increase in operating income was due to the inclusion of the Fisher businesses for a full year in 2007, $125 million of pre-tax charges associated with the Fisher merger incurred in 2006 and, to a lesser extent, higher profitability at existing businesses resulting from incremental revenues, price increases and productivity improvements. These increases were offset in part by $400 million of higher amortization expense as a result of acquisition-related intangible assets from the Fisher merger and other acquisitions. Restructuring and other costs were recorded during 2007 and 2006. Restructuring costs in 2007 primarily include merger-related exit costs at existing businesses. The cost of actions at Fisher businesses has been charged to the cost of the acquisition, while the cost of actions at existing businesses being integrated with Fisher is charged to restructuring expense. In 2007, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $91 million, including $49 million of charges to cost of revenues, substantially all related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition (principally Fisher). The company incurred $40 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. The company also recorded $2 million of loss on sale of a small business unit (Note 15). In 2006, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $123 million, including $78 million of charges to cost of revenues, primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition (principally Fisher) and $30 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. In addition, the company recorded a charge of $15 million for in-process research and development at Fisher on the merger date. The company has substantially finalized its plan for restructuring actions at Fisher or within existing businesses with which Fisher is being integrated. Such actions have included rationalization of product lines, consolidation of facilities and reductions in staffing levels. Financial Statement Index 41 Table of Contents In October 2007, the company decided to undertake closure of a Laboratory Products and Services segment manufacturing facility in France. The operations of the factory will be consolidated with those of existing factories in a phased plan through mid-2009. The company recorded $11 million of charges associated with this action in 2007. The company estimates additional future charges for retention, real estate abandonment, moving costs and accelerated depreciation on assets to be abandoned as a result of this action will total $7 to $9 million, including cash costs of $6 to $8 million, which will be recorded between the first quarter of 2008 and mid-2009, when the facility ceases remaining operations. Also, the company has identified other actions totaling $4 million that will be undertaken in 2008. The restructuring actions initiated in 2007 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of 2007 and early 2008 of approximately $11 million, principally in the Analytical Technologies segment. Segment Results (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Change Revenues: Analytical Technologies $ 4,256.0 $ 2,425.8 75% Laboratory Products and Services 5,842.2 1,406.6 315% Eliminations (351.8 ) (40.8 ) Consolidated Revenues $ 9,746.4 $ 3,791.6 157% Operating Income: Analytical Technologies $ 843.1 $ 383.7 120% Laboratory Products and Services 793.8 189.2 320% Subtotal Reportable Segments 1,636.9 572.9 186% Cost of Revenues Charges (49.2 ) (77.7 ) Restructuring and Other Costs, Net (42.2 ) (45.7 ) Amortization of Acquisition-related Intangible Assets (571.1 ) (170.8 ) Stock-based Compensation Acceleration Charge — (36.7 ) Consolidated Operating Income $ 974.4 $ 242.0 303% The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges to cost of revenues, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; and charges for the acceleration of stock-based compensation following the merger with Fisher. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Analytical Technologies (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Change Revenues $ 4,256.0 $ 2,425.8 75% Operating Income Margin 19.8% 15.8% 4.0 pts. Financial Statement Index 42 Table of Contents Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $1.83 billion to $4.26 billion in 2007 primarily due to the merger with Fisher and other acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, increased revenues at existing businesses and favorable currency translation. Had the Fisher merger occurred on January 1, 2006, revenues would have increased $514 million (14%) over pro forma 2006 revenues, including increases of a) $99 million due to acquisitions made by the combined companies, net of divestitures, b) $136 million due to the favorable effect of currency translation and c) $279 million due to increased revenue at existing businesses as a result of increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. The increase in demand was from life science and industrial customers due in part to strong market response to new products. Growth was particularly strong in sales of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments as well as environmental monitoring equipment and, to a lesser extent, process instruments and diagnostic tools. Operating income margin was 19.8% in 2007 and 15.8% in 2006. The increase resulted from profit on incremental revenues and, to a lesser extent, price increases and productivity improvements, including cost-reduction measures following restructuring actions. Had the merger with Fisher occurred on January 1, 2006, operating income margin would have been 17.2% in 2006. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Change Revenues $ 5,842.2 $ 1,406.6 315% Operating Income Margin 13.6% 13.5% 0.1 pts. Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $4.44 billion to $5.84 billion in 2007, primarily due to the merger with Fisher and other acquisitions. Had the Fisher merger occurred on January 1, 2006, revenues would have increased $405 million (7%) over pro forma 2006 revenues, including increases of a) $30 million due to acquisitions made by the combined companies, net of divestitures, b) $106 million due to the favorable effect of currency translation and c) $269 million due to increased revenue at existing businesses as a result of increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales made through the segment’s research market channel, which includes the Fisher catalog, and revenues from the company’s biopharma outsourcing offerings were strong. Operating income margin increased to 13.6% in 2007 from 13.5% in 2006, primarily due to the price increases and productivity improvements, including restructuring actions, offset in part by inclusion of Fisher revenues, which have a slightly lower operating margin than the company’s legacy laboratory equipment business. Had the merger with Fisher occurred on January 1, 2006, operating income margin would have been 12.2% in 2006. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $93 million and $33 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively (Note 4). Other expense, net, includes interest income, interest expense, gain on investments, net, equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and other items, net. Interest income increased to $47 million in 2007 from $16 million in the same period of 2006, primarily due to higher invested cash balances from operating cash flow and, to a lesser extent, increased market interest rates. Interest expense increased to $140 million in 2007 from $52 million in 2006, primarily as a result of debt assumed in the merger with Fisher. In August 2007, the FASB issued proposed guidance on accounting for convertible debt instruments that, if enacted, would increase the company’s reported interest expense in a manner that reflects interest rates of similar non-convertible debt. The change would not affect the company’s cash interest payments. There can be no assurance at this time, however, as to the content of any final FASB rules on this topic. Financial Statement Index 43 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes The company’s effective tax rate was 11.5% and 20.6% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The tax provision in 2007 was favorably affected by a one-time benefit of $32 million, discussed below. In addition to the impact of this item, the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to geographic changes in profits, in particular lower income in the United States due to charges and amortization associated with the Fisher merger, together with the impact of an increased U.S. tax credit for foreign taxes, an enhanced tax credit for qualifying U.S. research costs, growth in lower tax regions such as Asia and, to a lesser extent, a tax gain in excess of the related book gain on the sale of a product line in 2006. In 2007, the United Kingdom enacted new tax legislation that will become effective on April 1, 2008, lowering its corporate tax rate. Denmark, Canada and Germany also enacted new tax legislation, with various effective dates, that will reduce the corporate tax rate. As a result of these changes in tax rates, the deferred tax balances of all the company’s entities in these countries have been adjusted to reflect the new tax rates in 2007. Contingent Liabilities At year-end 2007, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. See “Litigation and Related Contingencies” in Note 11. An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the matters described therein could materially affect the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This statement does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for the company’s monetary assets and liabilities in 2008 and for other assets and liabilities in 2009. The company does not expect a material effect on its monetary assets and liabilities from adopting SFAS No. 157 and is currently evaluating the potential impact on its nonmonetary assets and liabilities of adopting SFAS No. 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.” SFAS No. 159 permits entities to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The fair value measurement election is irrevocable once made and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings. The effect of adoption will be reported as a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for the company beginning January 1, 2008. The company does not expect a material effect from adoption of this standard. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, “Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141R, among other aspects, requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and requires the acquirer to disclose certain information to enable users to understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. The statement requires that cash outflows such as transaction costs and post-acquisition restructuring be charged to expense instead of capitalized as a cost of the acquisition. Contingent purchase price will be recorded at its initial fair value and then re-measured as time passes through adjustments to net income. SFAS No. 141R is effective for the company in 2009. The company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption. Financial Statement Index 44 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements.” SFAS No. 160 will change the accounting for minority interests, which will be reclassified as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. SFAS No. 160 is effective for the company in 2009. The company does not expect a material effect from adoption of this standard. Discontinued Operations Subsequent to the 2006 acquisition of GV Instruments Limited (GVI), the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) commenced an investigation of the transaction to determine whether it qualified for consideration under the UK Enterprise Act. On December 15, 2006, the OFT referred the transaction to the UK Competition Commission for further investigation under the Enterprise Act to determine whether the transaction had resulted in, or may be expected to result in, a substantial lessening of competition within any market in the UK for goods or services, particularly gas isotope ratio mass spectrometers (Gas IRMS), thermal ionization mass spectrometers (TIMS) and multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers. The Competition Commission published its final report on May 30, 2007, concluding that the company’s acquisition of GVI would lead to a substantial lessening of competition in the UK in the markets for Gas IRMS and TIMS products. The Competition Commission has further concluded that a divestiture remedy was appropriate and has therefore required the company to divest of either GVI as a whole, or its Gas IRMS and TIMS assets (which together comprise the majority of the business), to purchasers approved by the Competition Commission. As a result of this divestiture requirement the company recorded after-tax impairment charges in 2007 totaling $29 million. The loss primarily represents non-cash charges to reduce the carrying value of the business to estimated disposal value. Due to the immateriality of the operating results of this business relative to consolidated results, the company has not reclassified the historical results and accounts of this business to discontinued operations. In February 2008, the company completed the sale of GVI’s two principal product lines that required divestiture. Aside from the impairment loss related to the divestiture of GVI, the company had after-tax gains of $10 million in 2007 from discontinued operations, primarily from the receipt of additional proceeds from the sale of a business in 2000 and a revision to the company’s estimate of loss from litigation related to a divested business. The company had after-tax gains of $2 million in 2006 from the disposal of discontinued operations. The gains represent additional proceeds from the sale of several businesses prior to 2004, net of a charge for the settlement of an indemnification claim that arose from a divested business. 2006 Compared With 2005 Continuing Operations Sales in 2006 were $3.79 billion, an increase of $1.16 billion (44%) from 2005. Sales increased $978 million due to acquisitions (principally Fisher), net of divestitures. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $18 million in 2006. Aside from the effect of acquisitions, net of divestitures, and currency translation, revenues increased $163 million (6%) primarily due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, price increases, as described by segment below. Growth was strong in Asia and Europe and moderate in North America. In 2006, operating income and operating income margin were $242 million and 6.4%, respectively, compared with $263 million and 10.0%, respectively, in 2005. The decrease in operating income and operating income margin was due to $125 million of pre-tax charges associated with the Fisher merger and $93 million of higher amortization expense, principally due to the Fisher merger. The $125 million of charges includes $73 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of the merger, $37 million of accelerated stock-based compensation due to a change in control occurring at the merger date and $15 million of in-process research and development at Fisher on the date of the merger. The unfavorable effect of these items was offset in part by the inclusion of Fisher’s results from November 9, 2006, through the end of the year and higher profitability at existing businesses due to increased revenue, productivity improvements, including lower costs following restructuring actions and, to a lesser extent, price increases. Financial Statement Index 45 Table of Contents In 2006, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $123 million, including $78 million of charges to cost of revenues consisting of $75 million for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition (principally Fisher) and $3 million for accelerated depreciation on fixed assets being abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $30 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. As discussed above, the company recorded a charge of $15 million for in-process research and development at Fisher on the merger date. In 2005, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $30 million, including charges to cost of revenues of $13 million, primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company incurred $23 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses in connection with the integration of Kendro with existing businesses. In addition, the company recorded a gain of $8 million, primarily from the sale of six abandoned buildings and a charge of $2 million, principally for the writedown of a building held for sale.

Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $419 million to $2.43 billion in 2006. Sales increased $249 million due to the Fisher merger and other acquisitions, net of divestitures. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $10 million in 2006. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $160 million (8%) due to higher broad-based demand from life science and industrial customers combined with strong market Financial Statement Index 46 Table of Contents response to new products and, to a lesser extent, price increases. Growth was particularly strong in sales of mass spectrometry and spectroscopy instruments and, to a lesser extent, anatomical pathology products and equipment sold in commodity markets such as steel, petroleum and cement. Operating income margin was 15.8% in 2006 and 14.2% in 2005. The increase resulted from profit on incremental revenues and, to a lesser extent, price increases and productivity improvements, including cost-reduction measures following restructuring actions. Had stock option compensation been recorded as expense in 2005, the operating income margin in 2005 would have been 13.4%. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Change Revenues $ 1,406.6 $ 626.3 125% Operating Income Margin 13.5% 13.8% (0.3) pts. Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $780 million to $1.41 billion in 2006. Sales increased $769 million due to the Fisher merger and other acquisitions, net of divestitures. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $8 million in 2006. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $3 million due to an increase in demand for laboratory equipment. Operating income margin decreased to 13.5% in 2006 from 13.8% in 2005, primarily due to the inclusion of stock option compensation in 2006 following adoption of SFAS No. 123R, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including restructuring actions. Had stock option compensation been recorded as expense in 2005, the operating income margin in 2005 would have been 13.1%. Other Income (Expense), Net The company reported other expense, net, of $33 million in 2006 and other income, net, of $22 million in 2005 (Note 4). Interest income increased to $16 million in 2006 from $12 million in 2005, primarily due to higher invested cash balances from operating cash flow and, to a lesser extent, increased market interest rates, offset in part by cash used to fund acquisitions. Interest expense increased to $52 million in 2006 from $27 million in 2005, as a result of debt assumed in the merger with Fisher and, to a lesser extent, a full year of debt used to partially fund the Kendro acquisition and higher rates associated with the company’s variable-rate debt. During 2006 and 2005, the company had gains on investments, net, of $1 million and $35 million, respectively. The gains included $29 million in 2005 from the sale of shares of Thoratec Corporation and a loss of $1 million in 2005 from the sale of shares of Newport Corporation, in addition to other gains from the company’s investment portfolio activity. The company obtained common shares of Thoratec as part of the sale of Thermo Cardiosystems Inc. in 2001 and obtained the shares of Newport as part of the sale of Spectra-Physics in 2004. Following the sale of shares in 2005, the company no longer owns shares of Thoratec or Newport. Other income in 2006 and 2005 also includes net currency transaction gains and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Provision for Income Taxes The company’s effective tax rate was 20.6% and 30.6% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2006, compared with 2005, was primarily due to geographic changes in profits, in particular lower income in the United States due to charges associated with the Fisher merger, partially offset by non-deductible merger related costs. The provision for income taxes in 2005 includes $4 million for the estimated effect of a tax audit of prior years in a non-U.S. country. The effect of this charge increased the effective tax rate in 2005 by 1.5 percentage points. Financial Statement Index 47 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations The company’s discontinued operations reported after-tax income of $0.5 million in 2006, representing the results of two small Fisher businesses held for sale. The company had after-tax gains of $2 million in 2006 and $25 million in 2005 from the disposal of discontinued operations. The 2006 gains represent additional proceeds from the sale of several businesses prior to 2004, net of a charge for the settlement of an indemnification claim that arose from a divested business. An after-tax gain of $17 million arose from the September 2005 sale of the company’s point of care and rapid diagnostics business for $53 million in cash. Revenues and pre-tax loss of the divested business totaled $30 million and $1 million, respectively, in 2004 and revenues and pre-tax income totaled $27 million and $1 million, respectively, in 2005 through the date of sale. Due to the immateriality of the operating results of this business relative to consolidated results, the company has not reclassified the historical results and accounts of this business to discontinued operations. In addition to the sale of this business, the company had after-tax gains aggregating $8 million in 2005 representing additional proceeds from the sale of businesses divested prior to 2004, including the sale of abandoned real estate and post-closing adjustments, and the settlement of litigation and an arbitration award related to divested businesses. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $1.76 billion at December 31, 2007, compared with $1.51 billion at December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to a reduction in short-term borrowings. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short-term available-for-sale investments of $639 million at December 31, 2007, compared with $691 million at December 31, 2006. 2007 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.48 billion during 2007. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $125 million in 2007. The company did not make significant U.S. estimated tax payments in 2007, primarily due to tax deductions for merger-related stock-based compensation and net operating loss carryforwards. The company expects to make tax payments of approximately $325 to $375 million in 2008. The company made $78 million of merger related payments in 2007, which reduced operating cash. Payments for restructuring actions of the company’s continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $40 million during 2007. In connection with restructuring actions undertaken by continuing operations, the company had accrued $19 million for restructuring costs at December 31, 2007. The company expects to pay approximately $14 million of this amount for severance, retention and other costs, primarily through 2009. The balance of $5 million will be paid for lease obligations over the remaining terms of the leases, with approximately 23% to be paid through 2008 and the remainder through 2013. In addition, at December 31, 2007, the company had accrued $10 million for acquisition expenses. Accrued acquisition expenses included $4 million of severance and relocation obligations, which the company expects to pay primarily during 2008. The remaining balance primarily represents abandoned-facility payments that will be paid over the remaining terms of the leases through 2010. During 2007, the primary investing activities of the company’s continuing operations, excluding available-for-sale investment activities, were acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $497 million on acquisitions and $176 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company collected a note receivable from Newport Corporation totaling $48 million and had proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $19 million, principally real estate. The company’s discontinued operations provided cash of $31 million from investing activities, principally the sale of Genevac Limited. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents The company’s financing activities used $929 million of cash during 2007, principally for the repayment of $464 million of short-term debt and the repurchase of $898 million of the company’s common stock, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $345 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $97 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. In February 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the company’s common stock through February 28, 2008. On August 9, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $700 million of the company’s common stock through August 8, 2008. At December 31, 2007, $102 million was available for future repurchases of the company’s common stock under the August 8, 2008 Board authorization. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2008, such expenditures will approximate $230 to $250 million. The company believes that its existing resources, including cash and investments, future cash flow from operations and available borrowings under its existing revolving credit facilities, are sufficient to meet the working capital requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2006 Cash provided by operating activities was $406 million during 2006, including $407 million provided by continuing operations. A reduction in current liabilities used cash of $80 million, primarily as a result of merger-related payments made following completion of the transaction totaling $157 million, including executive severance and retirement benefits, and transaction costs incurred by Fisher, offset in part by an increase in other accrued expenses. Cash of $32 million was provided by collections on accounts receivable. Payments for restructuring actions of the company’s continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $30 million during 2006. During 2006, the primary investing activities of the company’s continuing operations, excluding available-for-sale investment activities, included acquisitions, the purchase of property, plant and equipment and the sale of product lines. Cash acquired in the merger with Fisher totaled $360 million, net of transaction costs. The company expended $132 million on acquisitions and $77 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company partially liquidated assets totaling $40 million in a Fisher retirement trust to fund payments that were due to former Fisher executives following the merger. The company had proceeds from the sale of product lines of $9 million. Investing activities of the company’s discontinued operations provided $5 million of cash during 2006, primarily additional proceeds from a business divested prior to 2004. The company’s financing activities used $260 million of cash during 2006, principally for the repurchase of $300 million of the company’s common stock and the repayment of $335 million of debt, offset in part by short-term borrowing and proceeds of stock option exercises. The company increased short-term borrowings by $177 million in 2006. The company had proceeds of $180 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $17 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. 2005 Cash provided by operating activities was $271 million during 2005, including $273 million provided by continuing operations and $2 million used by discontinued operations. Cash of $42 million was provided by an increase in other current liabilities, primarily accrued payroll and benefits due to the timing of payments, and deferred revenue, pending completion of obligations to customers. Income tax payments of approximately $13 million arose from taxes on gains on the sale of investments. The company contributed $11 million of funding to a U.K. pension plan in June 2005. Payments for restructuring actions of the company’s continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $20 million in 2005. Financial Statement Index 49 Table of Contents During 2005, the primary investing activities of the company’s continuing operations, excluding available-for-sale investment activities, included acquisitions and the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $933 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisitions of Niton, R&P, Kendro and Ionalytics (Note 2). The company expended $44 million for the purchases of property, plant and equipment and had proceeds from the sale of property, principally abandoned real estate, of $16 million. Investing activities of the company’s discontinued operations provided $66 million of cash in 2005, primarily from the sale of its point of care and rapid diagnostics business in September 2005 and the sale of a building of a previously divested business in August 2005. The company’s financing activities provided $391 million of cash during 2005, principally from the issuance of $250 million senior notes due in 2015 and a net increase in short-term borrowings of $119 million. The company received net proceeds of $27 million from the exercise of employee stock options during 2005. The company repaid in full $570 million of borrowings under its bridge loan with cash and proceeds of new debt issuances described below. In May 2005, the company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5% senior notes (the Notes) due 2015, with an effective interest rate of 5.27% after including the impact of an interest rate swap arrangement. Under the Notes’ Indenture, the company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants. Also in May 2005, the company entered into an arrangement that provides the company an uncommitted line of credit of up to $250 million through a series of short-term money market loans funded on an ongoing basis in the secondary market. Such money market loans have maturity periods of overnight to 364 days and bear varying rates of interest based on the maturity date and market rate at the time of issuance. In May 2005, the company borrowed $250 million through three short-term loans under the money market arrangement with maturities of one week to three months. As of December 31, 2005, the company had repaid the borrowings under this arrangement. In June 2005, the company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility with a bank group that provided up to 175 million euros. The facility carried interest at a Euribor rate plus 35 basis points. As of December 31, 2005, the company had outstanding borrowings under this facility of 105 million euros ($124 million) in two tranches with maturities in January 2006 and with a weighted average interest rate of 2.47%. The facility was terminated in 2006. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2005 - 2007 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $12 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the company’s own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 50 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the company’s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2007. Payments Due by Period or Expiration of Commitment (In millions) 2008 2009 and 2010 2011 and 2012 2013 and Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments: Debt principal, including short term debt (a) $ 147.8 $ 2.5 $ 0.6 $ 2,036.3 $ 2,187.2 Interest (b) 103.1 189.4 188.9 609.9 1,091.3 Capital lease obligations 1.5 3.0 2.9 0.6 8.0 Operating lease obligations 91.3 135.0 82.8 83.1 392.2 Unconditional purchase obligations (c) 137.4 13.3 0.9 — 151.6 Letters of credit and bank guarantees 89.8 7.9 0.3 0.5 98.5 Surety bonds and other guarantees 19.2 2.0 8.5 — 29.7 Pension obligations on balance sheet 33.3 46.2 50.6 64.8 194.9 Asset retirement obligations 5.9 4.5 4.6 16.3 31.3 Other (d) 11.0 — — — 11.0 $ 640.3 $ 403.8 $ 340.1 $ 2,811.5 $ 4,195.7 (a) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for debt and do not include any deferred issuance costs. (b) For the purpose of this calculation, amounts assume interest rates on floating rate obligations remain unchanged from levels at December 31, 2007, throughout the life of the obligation. (c) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (d) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $79 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2008, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $230 to $250 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business – Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Financial Statement Index 51 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward contracts to manage certain exposures to currencies. The company enters into forward currency-exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than its subsidiaries’ local currencies. The company does not engage in extensive currency hedging activities; however, the purpose of the company’s currency hedging activities is to protect the company’s local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The company’s forward currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euros, U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. Income and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative currency agreements. Interest Rates Certain of the company’s short-term available-for-sale investments and long-term obligations are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the rate at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% decrease in year-end 2007 and 2006 market interest rates would result in a net negative impact to the company of $181 million and $84 million, respectively, on the net fair value of its interest-sensitive financial instruments. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments. A 100-basis-point increase in 90-day LIBOR at December 31, 2007 and 2006, would increase the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by $4.7 million and $9 million, respectively. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the company’s reporting currency as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros, British pounds sterling and Japanese yen. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2007 and 2006 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $297 million and $324 million, respectively. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2007 and 2006 currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $22 million and $7 million, respectively. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2007 and 2006 currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $26 million and $5 million, respectively, on the company’s net income. Financial Statement Index 52 Table of Contents Equity Prices The company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in price. In addition, the company’s convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the company’s common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company’s available-for-sale investments and convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year-end 2007 and 2006 market equity prices would reduce the fair value of the company’s convertible obligations by $184 million and $128 million, respectively.",2023-12-30 17:37:57.408504
97745,TMO,THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.,2009,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reference is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report. Thermo Electron Corporation and Fisher Scientific International Inc. completed a merger of the two companies on November 9, 2006 in a tax-free, stock-for-stock exchange. The Fisher businesses are a leading provider of products and services to the scientific research community and clinical laboratories. The Fisher businesses provide a suite of products and services to customers worldwide from biochemicals, cell-culture media and proprietary RNAi technology to rapid-diagnostic tests, safety products and other consumable supplies. Fisher had revenues of $5.4 billion in 2005. Fisher’s results are included in the accompanying financial statements from November 9, 2006. Following the merger, the company was renamed Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. To assist in year over year comparisons, certain information in the following discussion of the company’s results of operations has been presented on a pro forma basis, as if the two companies had been combined from the beginning of 2006. Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own core technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. Following the merger with Fisher, the company’s continuing operations fall into two principal business segments: Analytical Technologies and Laboratory Products and Services. During the first quarter of 2008, the company transferred management responsibility and related financial reporting and monitoring for several small product lines between segments. The company has historically moved a product line between segments when a shift in strategic focus of either the product line or a segment more closely aligns the product line with a segment different than that in which it had previously been reported. Prior period segment information has been reclassified to reflect these transfers. Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government customers. (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,471.2 42.6% $ 4,181.7 42.9% Laboratory Products and Services 6,453.3 61.5% 5,911.1 60.6% Eliminations (426.5 ) (4.1)% (346.4 ) (3.5)% $ 10,498.0 100% $ 9,746.4 100% Sales in 2008 were $10.50 billion, an increase of $752 million from 2007. Aside from the effects of acquisitions and divestitures and currency translation (discussed in total and by segment below), revenues increased over 2007 revenues by $453 million due to higher revenues at existing businesses as a result of increased demand, discussed below, and, to a lesser extent, price increases. The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in the past two years. The principal acquisitions included La-Pha-Pack, a manufacturer and provider of chromatography consumables and related accessories in December 2007; Priority Solutions International, a third-party logistics provider to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries in October 2007; NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., a supplier of micro UV-Vis spectrophotometry and fluorescence scientific instruments in October 2007 and Qualigens Fine Chemicals, an India-based chemical manufacturer and supplier in September 2007. Financial Statement Index 33 Table of Contents In 2008, operating income and operating income margin were $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, compared with $974 million and 10.0%, respectively, in 2007. The increase in operating income was due to higher profitability at existing businesses resulting from incremental revenues including price increases, merger integration savings and productivity improvements including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. The increase also resulted from $48 million of lower cost of revenues charges, primarily merger-related, and from $7 million of lower restructuring and other costs in 2008, principally due to a curtailment gain in 2008 associated with a pension plan in the U.S. These increases were offset in part by a $32 million increase in amortization expense as a result of acquisition-related intangible assets from 2007 and 2008 acquisitions. The company’s effective tax rate was 14.0% and 11.5% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by $28 million or 2.4 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of a change in the apportionment of state tax rates and newly enacted reductions in tax rates in Switzerland. Aside from the impact of these items, the tax rate was unfavorably affected by an increase in income in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2007 was favorably affected by $32 million or 3.6 percentage points resulting from enacted reductions in tax rates in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Canada and Germany on the company’s deferred tax balances. Income from continuing operations increased to $989 million in 2008 from $780 million in 2007, primarily due to the items discussed above that increased operating income in 2008 offset in part by the higher tax rate in 2008. During 2008, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $1.42 billion, compared with $1.48 billion for 2007. The decrease resulted from higher payments for income taxes and an increased investment in working capital items offset in part by improved cash flow at existing businesses. Cash flow from operations in 2007 was net of $78 million in merger-related operating cash outflows, including severance and retirement benefits as well as transaction costs incurred by Fisher that were paid subsequent to 2006. As of December 31, 2008, the company’s outstanding debt totaled $2.06 billion, of which approximately $969 million is convertible debt, at conversion prices ranging from $23.73 to $40.20 per share. As of February 27, 2009, $295 million of the convertible debt was currently convertible. Although the company’s experience is that convertible debentures are not normally converted by investors until close to their maturity date, it is possible, particularly in the current uncertain financial climate, that debentures could be converted prior to their maturity date if, for example, a holder perceives the market for the debentures to be weaker than the market for the common stock. Upon an investor’s election to convert, the company is required to pay the original principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the company's election. Should holders elect to convert or exercise their put rights, the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund substantially all of these principal payments. The facility is an unsecured revolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $950 million at December 31, 2008. The company believes that its existing cash and short-term investments of $1.29 billion as of December 31, 2008, and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to equity investments, bad debts, sales returns, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets, warranty obligations, Financial Statement Index 34 Table of Contents income taxes, pension costs, contingencies and litigation, stock-based compensation, restructuring and sale of businesses. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: (a) Accounts Receivable The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such allowances totaled $43 million at December 31, 2008. The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. (b) Inventories The company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence for differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required. (c) Intangible Assets and Goodwill The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. A significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets that require the use of significant judgment in determining (i) fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Amortizable intangible assets totaled $5.10 billion at December 31, 2008. The company reviews other intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $8.68 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2008. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. Financial Statement Index 35 Table of Contents The company’s market capitalization decreased from September 2008 to approximately book value in the three business days before and after year-end. Management believes that the decrease occurred primarily due to economic uncertainty affecting the broader financial markets and concern about companies’ ability to reach their financial goals. The company’s businesses, however, were not materially adversely affected by the significant global downturn during 2008. Projections of profitability for 2009 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at December 31, 2008. There can be no assurance, however, that further deterioration of the financial markets will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary. (d) Other Long-Lived Assets The company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Other long-lived assets totaled $1.64 billion at December 31, 2008, including $1.28 billion of fixed assets. In testing a long-lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset-related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long-lived assets may be necessary. (e) Revenues In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change, the company’s revenue recognition would be affected. If fair value is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed. In instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing. The company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or “elements.” The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately. The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required. Financial Statement Index 36 Table of Contents (f) Warranty Obligations At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for warranty obligations of the company’s continuing operations totaled $44 million at December 31, 2008. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary. (g) Income Taxes In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized. The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income. The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Following the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) in 2009, any such reversals will be recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $161 million at December 31, 2008. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Accrued income taxes totaled $33 million at December 31, 2008. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the company’s tax provision would result. (h) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Reserves of Fisher as of the merger date, including environmental reserves, were initially recorded at their fair value and as such were discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. Financial Statement Index 37 Table of Contents (i) Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Several of the company’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled income of $7 million in 2008, including $19 million of income from curtailment of pension plans. The company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $303 million at year-end 2008 compared with $170 million at year-end 2007. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $82 million. The decrease in the funded status in 2008 resulted primarily from a downturn that affected financial markets. The company expects to contribute $20 to $30 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2009. (j) Stock-based Compensation The fair value of each stock option granted by the company is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock. The expected lives of grants through 2007 were estimated using the simplified method for “plain vanilla” options as permitted by SAB 107. Thereafter, historical data on exercise patterns became the basis for determining the expected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock-based compensation. The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures. If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required. (k) Restructuring Costs The company records restructuring charges for the cost of vacating facilities based on future lease obligations and expected sub-rental income. The company’s accrued restructuring costs for abandoned facilities in continuing operations totaled $6 million at December 31, 2008. Should actual cash flows associated with sub-rental income from vacated facilities vary from estimated amounts, adjustments may be required. Financial Statement Index 38 Table of Contents (l) Assets Held for Sale The company estimates the expected proceeds from any assets held for sale and, when necessary, records losses to reduce the carrying value of these assets to estimated realizable value. Should the actual or estimated proceeds, which would include post-closing purchase price adjustments, vary from current estimates, results could differ from expected amounts. Results of Operations 2008 Compared With 2007 Continuing Operations Sales in 2008 were $10.50 billion, an increase of $752 million from 2007. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $113 million in 2008. Sales increased $186 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effect of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $453 million primarily due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, price increases, as described by segment below. Growth was very strong in Asia, moderate in North America and modest in Europe although in the fourth quarter of 2008, growth slowed in Asia and improved in Europe. Although the company did not experience a material adverse impact on its revenues or profitability in 2008 as a result of the current business environment, no assurances can be given that these poor economic conditions will not continue in 2009 or beyond, and cause certain customers to delay or cancel orders for the company’s products or services. In the latter part of 2008, the U.S. dollar strengthened against other major currencies in which the company sells product and services. Strengthening of the dollar had a negative effect on the amount of revenues the company reported in U.S. dollars of approximately 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Were the currency exchange rates in effect in early 2009, to remain during 2009, translation would negatively affect revenues in 2009 by approximately 4%. The lower revenues would unfavorably affect earnings per share by approximately $.15. In 2008, operating income and operating income margin were $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, compared with $974 million and 10.0%, respectively, in 2007. The increase in operating income was due to higher profitability at existing businesses resulting from incremental revenues including price increases, merger integration savings and productivity improvements including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. The increase also resulted from $48 million of lower cost of revenues charges, primarily merger-related, and from $7 million of lower restructuring and other costs in 2008, principally due to a curtailment gain in 2008 associated with a pension plan in the U.S. These increases were offset in part by a $32 million increase in amortization expense as a result of acquisition-related intangible assets from 2007 and 2008 acquisitions. Restructuring and other costs were recorded during 2008 and 2007. In 2008, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $37 million, including $2 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $38 million of cash costs primarily for severance to reduce headcount at several businesses in response to economic uncertainty and a decline in financial markets and for abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded a $7 million charge for the impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets associated with a small business unit acquired as part of Fisher, a $5 million loss from a litigation-related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher, a $3 million net loss on the sale of businesses and a $3 million charge for in-process research and development at an acquired business. These charges were offset by a $19 million gain on the curtailment of part of a pension plan in the U.S. (Note 14). In 2007, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $91 million, including $49 million of charges to cost of revenues, substantially all related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of Financial Statement Index 39 Table of Contents acquisition (principally Fisher). The company incurred $40 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. The company also recorded $2 million of loss on sale of a small business unit. As of February 27, 2009, the company has identified actions totaling approximately $7 million that will be undertaken in 2009 and expects to identify additional actions during 2009. The restructuring actions initiated in 2008 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of 2008 and early 2009 of approximately $34 million, including $26 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $8 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. Segment Results (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Change Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,471.2 $ 4,181.7 7% Laboratory Products and Services 6,453.3 5,911.1 9% Eliminations (426.5 ) (346.4 ) 23% Consolidated Revenues $ 10,498.0 $ 9,746.4 8% Operating Income Analytical Technologies $ 957.1 $ 825.4 16% Laboratory Products and Services 912.0 811.5 12% Subtotal Reportable Segments 1,869.1 1,636.9 14% Cost of Revenues Charges (1.5 ) (49.2 ) Restructuring and Other Costs, Net (35.4 ) (42.2 ) Amortization of Acquisition-related Intangible Assets (602.8 ) (571.1 ) Consolidated Operating Income $ 1,229.4 $ 974.4 26% The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges to cost of revenues, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; and charges for the acceleration of stock-based compensation following the merger with Fisher. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Income from the company’s reportable segments increased 14% to $1.87 billion in 2008 due primarily to higher profitability at existing businesses, resulting from incremental revenues including price increases and productivity improvements including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. This improvement was offset in part by higher commodity prices. Analytical Technologies (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Change Revenues $ 4,471.2 $ 4,181.7 7% Operating Income Margin 21.4% 19.7% 1.7 pts. Financial Statement Index 40 Table of Contents Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $290 million to $4.47 billion in 2008. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase of $74 million in 2008. Sales increased $42 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $174 million primarily due to higher demand and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. The higher demand was due, in part, to the introduction of new products. Growth was particularly strong in sales of scientific instruments and specialty diagnostics. Sales growth slowed in the latter part of 2008 due to lower fourth quarter sales of environmental monitoring equipment and process instruments which were unfavorably affected by a downturn in industrial markets. Operating income margin was 21.4% in 2008 and 19.7% in 2007. The increase resulted from profit on incremental revenues and, to a lesser extent, price increases and productivity improvements, including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Change Revenues $ 6,453.3 $ 5,911.1 9% Operating Income Margin 14.1% 13.7% 0.4 pts. Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $542 million to $6.45 billion in 2008. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase of $39 million in 2008. Sales increased $163 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $340 million primarily due to higher demand and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. Sales made through the segment’s research market and healthcare market channels and revenues from the company’s biopharma services were particularly strong. These increases in revenue were offset in part by lower sales in early 2008 made through the segment’s safety market channel. The safety market channel sales are in part dependent on expenditures for homeland security that vary based on government spending priorities. In July 2008, the company and a supplier of its healthcare market channel extended an existing agreement for two years through 2010. Under the revised agreement, the company expects its sales volume in 2009 of products purchased from the supplier to decrease by approximately $60 million from 2008. Operating income margin increased to 14.1% in 2008 from 13.7% in 2007, primarily due to profit on incremental revenue and, to a lesser extent, price increases and productivity improvements, including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring actions, offset in part by the impact of inflation on commodities such as raw resin, steel and plastics as well as higher fuel and freight costs. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $80 million and $93 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively (Note 4). Other expense, net, includes interest income, interest expense, gain on investments, net, equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and other items, net. The decrease was primarily due to $10 million of lower interest expense as a result of reduced market rates on variable rate debt and redemption of $129 million of long-term debt due in October 2008. See discussion below concerning a recent accounting pronouncement that will increase non-cash interest expense in 2009. Financial Statement Index 41 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes The company’s effective tax rate was 14.0% and 11.5% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by $28 million or 2.4 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of a change in the apportionment of state tax rates and newly enacted reductions in tax rates in Switzerland. Aside from the impact of these items, the tax rate was unfavorably affected by an increase in income in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2007 was favorably affected by $32 million or 3.6 percentage points resulting from enacted reductions in tax rates in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Canada and Germany on the company’s deferred tax balances. Contingent Liabilities At year-end 2008, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. See “Litigation and Related Contingencies” in Note 10. An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the matters described therein could materially affect the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This statement does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 was effective for the company’s monetary assets and liabilities in the first quarter of 2008 and for non-financial assets and liabilities beginning January 1, 2009 (Note 12). The company does not believe the impact of adopting the fair value guidance outlined in SFAS No. 157 to its non-financial assets and liabilities will have a material impact on its financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.” SFAS No. 159 permits entities to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The company adopted SFAS No. 159 beginning January 1, 2008. Adoption of the standard did not result in any change in the valuation of the company’s assets and liabilities. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, “Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141R does the following: requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and requires the acquirer to disclose certain information to enable users to understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. The statement requires that cash outflows such as transaction costs and post-acquisition restructuring be charged to expense instead of capitalized as a cost of the acquisition. Contingent purchase price will be recorded at its initial fair value and then re-measured as time passes through adjustments to net income. SFAS No. 141R is effective for the company, on a prospective basis, beginning January 1, 2009. The company expects no material effect at the adoption date; however, upon adoption, this statement may materially affect the accounting for any future business combinations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements.” SFAS No. 160 will change the accounting for minority interests, which will be reclassified as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. SFAS No. 160 is effective for the company beginning January 1, 2009. The company does not expect a material effect from adoption of this standard. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 161 requires disclosures of how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for; and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for the company beginning January 1, 2009. The company does not expect a material effect from adoption of this standard. Financial Statement Index 42 Table of Contents In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP APB No. 14-1, “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement).” FSP APB No. 14-1 requires the issuers of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components in a manner that reflects the issuer's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. FSP ABP No. 14-1 is effective for the company beginning January 1, 2009. Prior periods will be restated as if the new rule had been in effect in those periods. Early adoption is not permitted. While the company’s cash payments for interest will not be affected, based on current debt outstanding, the adoption of FSP APB No. 14-1 will increase the company’s reported interest expense in a manner that reflects interest rates of similar non-convertible debt. The company expects that annual interest expense will increase by approximately $23 million, which will unfavorably affect earnings per share by approximately $.03 per year following adoption of the rule. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF 03-6-1, “Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities.” FSP EITF 03-6-1 clarifies that share-based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive nonforfeitable dividends before vesting should be considered participating securities. As participating securities, these instruments should be included in the calculation of basic earnings per share. FSP EITF 03-6-1 is effective for the company beginning January 1, 2009. The company does not expect a material effect from adoption of this rule. In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets.” FSP No. 132(R)-1 requires additional disclosures about an employer’s plan assets of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. This rule expands current disclosures of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan assets to include information regarding the fair value measurements of plan assets similar to the company’s current SFAS No. 157 disclosures. FSP No. 132(R)-1 is effective for the company beginning in January 2009. Discontinued Operations During 2008, the company recorded additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after-tax gain of $6 million. The note was collected in July 2008. In 2007, the company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $29 million on a business held for sale and subsequently sold. The loss primarily represented the carrying value of the business in excess of the estimated disposal value. Aside from the impairment loss, the company had after-tax gains of $10 million in 2007 from discontinued operations, primarily from the receipt of additional proceeds from the sale of a business in 2000 and a revision to the company’s estimate of loss from litigation related to a divested business. 2007 Compared With 2006 Continuing Operations Sales in 2007 were $9.75 billion, an increase of $5.95 billion from 2006. Sales increased principally due to the merger with Fisher as well as other acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, increased demand and the favorable effect of currency translation. If the merger with Fisher had occurred on January 1, 2006, revenues would have increased $876 million (10%) over pro forma 2006 revenues, including increases of a) $128 million due to acquisitions made by the combined companies, net of divestitures, b) $241 million due to the favorable effect of currency translation and c) $507 million due to higher revenues at existing businesses as a result of increased demand and, to a lesser extent, price increases. Growth was particularly strong in Asia and, to a lesser extent, North America and more moderate in Europe. Financial Statement Index 43 Table of Contents In 2007, operating income and operating income margin were $974 million and 10.0%, respectively, compared with $242 million and 6.4%, respectively, in 2006. The increase in operating income was due to the inclusion of the Fisher businesses for a full year in 2007, $125 million of pre-tax charges associated with the Fisher merger incurred in 2006 and, to a lesser extent, higher profitability at existing businesses resulting from incremental revenues, price increases and productivity improvements. These increases were offset in part by $400 million of higher amortization expense as a result of acquisition-related intangible assets from the Fisher merger and other acquisitions. Restructuring and other costs were recorded during 2007 and 2006. Restructuring costs in 2007 primarily included merger-related exit costs at existing businesses. The cost of actions at Fisher businesses was charged to the cost of the acquisition, while the cost of actions at existing businesses being integrated with Fisher was charged to restructuring expense. In 2007, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $91 million, including $49 million of charges to cost of revenues, substantially all related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition (principally Fisher). The company incurred $40 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. The company also recorded $2 million of loss on sale of a small business unit. The restructuring actions initiated in 2007 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $11 million, primarily in the Analytical Technologies segment. In 2006, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $123 million, including $78 million of charges to cost of revenues, primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition (principally Fisher) and $30 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. In addition, the company recorded a charge of $15 million for in-process research and development at Fisher on the merger date. The company substantially finalized its plan for restructuring actions at Fisher or within existing businesses with which Fisher was being integrated by the end of 2007. Such actions included rationalization of product lines, consolidation of facilities and reductions in staffing levels. The restructuring actions initiated in 2006 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $11 million, including $6 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $5 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.

Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $1.81 billion to $4.18 billion in 2007 primarily due to the merger with Fisher and other acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, increased revenues at existing businesses and favorable currency translation. Had the Fisher merger occurred on January 1, 2006, revenues would have increased $507 million (14%) over pro forma 2006 revenues, including increases of a) $103 million due to acquisitions made by the combined companies, net of divestitures, b) $133 million due to the favorable effect of currency translation and c) $271 million due to increased revenue at existing businesses as a result of increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. The increase in demand was from life science and industrial customers due in part to strong market response to new products. Growth was particularly strong in sales of scientific instruments as well as environmental monitoring equipment and, to a lesser extent, process instruments and specialty diagnostic tools. Operating income margin was 19.7% in 2007 and 15.6% in 2006. The increase resulted from profit on incremental revenues and, to a lesser extent, price increases and productivity improvements, including cost-reduction measures following restructuring actions. Had the merger with Fisher occurred on January 1, 2006, operating income margin would have been 17.1% in 2006. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 Change Revenues $ 5,911.1 $ 1,463.9 304% Operating Income Margin 13.7% 13.8% (0.1) pts. Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $4.45 billion to $5.91 billion in 2007, primarily due to the merger with Fisher and other acquisitions. Had the Fisher merger occurred on January 1, 2006, revenues would have increased $407 million (7%) over pro forma 2006 revenues, including increases of a) $30 million due to acquisitions made by the combined companies, net of divestitures, b) $109 million due to the favorable effect of currency translation and c) $268 million due to increased revenue at existing businesses as a result of increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher prices. Sales made through the segment’s research market channel, which includes the Fisher catalog, and revenues from the company’s biopharma outsourcing offerings were strong. Operating income margin decreased to 13.7% in 2007 from 13.8% in 2006, primarily due to the inclusion of Fisher revenues, which have a slightly lower operating margin than the company’s legacy laboratory equipment business offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including restructuring actions. Had the merger with Fisher occurred on January 1, 2006, operating income margin would have been 12.3% in 2006. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $93 million and $33 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Interest income increased to $47 million in 2007 from $16 million in the same period of 2006, primarily due to higher invested cash balances from operating cash flow and, to a lesser extent, increased market interest rates. Interest expense increased to $140 million in 2007 from $52 million in 2006, primarily as a result of debt assumed in the merger with Fisher. Financial Statement Index 45 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes The company’s effective tax rate was 11.5% and 20.6% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The tax provision in 2007 was favorably affected by a one-time benefit of $32 million, or 3.6 percentage points, discussed below. In addition to the impact of this item, the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to geographic changes in profits, in particular lower income in the United States due to charges and amortization associated with the Fisher merger, together with the impact of an increased U.S. tax credit for foreign taxes, an enhanced tax credit for qualifying U.S. research costs, growth in lower tax regions such as Asia and, to a lesser extent, a tax gain in excess of the related book gain on the sale of a product line in 2006. In 2007, the United Kingdom enacted new tax legislation that became effective on April 1, 2008, lowering its corporate tax rate. Denmark, Canada and Germany also enacted new tax legislation, with various effective dates, that reduced the corporate tax rate. As a result of these changes in tax rates, the deferred tax balances of all the company’s entities in these countries were adjusted to reflect the new tax rates in 2007. Discontinued Operations Subsequent to the 2006 acquisition of GV Instruments Limited (GVI), the UK Competition Commission initiated an investigation of the transaction and concluded that the acquisition would lead to a substantial lessening of competition in the UK in certain markets. The Competition Commission further concluded that a divestiture remedy was appropriate and required the company to divest of either GVI as a whole, or its principal product lines to purchasers approved by the Competition Commission. As a result of this divestiture requirement, the company recorded after-tax impairment charges in 2007 totaling $29 million. The loss primarily represents non-cash charges to reduce the carrying value of the business to estimated disposal value. Due to the immateriality of the operating results of this business relative to consolidated results, the company has not reclassified the historical results and accounts of this business to discontinued operations. In February 2008, the company completed the sale. Aside from the impairment loss related to the divestiture of GVI, the company had after-tax gains of $10 million in 2007 from discontinued operations, primarily from the receipt of additional proceeds from the sale of a business in 2000 and a revision to the company’s estimate of loss from litigation related to a divested business. The company had after-tax gains of $2 million in 2006 from the disposal of discontinued operations. The gains represent additional proceeds from the sale of several businesses prior to 2004, net of a charge for the settlement of an indemnification claim that arose from a divested business. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $2.81 billion at December 31, 2008, compared with $1.76 billion at December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to increases in cash and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in current liabilities including accounts payable and accrued expenses and current maturities of long-term debt. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short-term available-for-sale investments of $1.29 billion at December 31, 2008, compared with $639 million at December 31, 2007. 2008 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.42 billion during 2008. A decrease in accounts payable used $124 million of cash due to the timing of payments at year-end. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $51 million and $50 million, respectively, representing working capital increases associated with the growth in revenues. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $292 million in 2008 compared with $125 million in 2007, primarily as a result of no longer having tax loss carryforwards in the U.S. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $36 million during 2008. Financial Statement Index 46 Table of Contents During 2008, the company’s primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $201 million for acquisitions and $264 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities used $228 million of cash during 2008, principally for the repurchase of $187 million of the company’s common stock and repayment of $151 million of debt, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $85 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $25 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. On September 11, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company’s common stock through September 10, 2009. At December 31, 2008, $415 million was available for future repurchases of the company’s common stock under this authorization. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2009, such expenditures will approximate $230 - $250 million. As of December 31, 2008, the company’s outstanding debt totaled $2.06 billion, of which approximately $969 million is convertible debt, at conversion prices ranging from $23.73 to $40.20 per share. As of February 27, 2009, $295 million of the convertible debt was currently convertible. Although the company’s experience is that convertible debentures are not normally converted by investors until close to their maturity date, it is possible, particularly in the current uncertain financial climate, that debentures could be converted prior to their maturity date if, for example, a holder perceives the market for the debentures to be weaker than the market for the common stock. Upon an investor’s election to convert, the company is required to pay the original principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the company's election. Should holders elect to convert, the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund substantially all of these principal payments. The facility is an unsecured revolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $950 million at December 31, 2008. The company believes that its existing cash and short-term investments of $1.29 billion as of December 31, 2008, and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2007 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.48 billion during 2007. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $125 million in 2007. The company did not make significant U.S. estimated tax payments in 2007, primarily due to tax deductions for merger-related stock-based compensation and net operating loss carryforwards. The company made $78 million of merger related payments in 2007, which reduced operating cash. Payments for restructuring actions of the company’s continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $40 million during 2007. During 2007, the primary investing activities of the company’s continuing operations were acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $497 million on acquisitions and $176 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company collected a note receivable from Newport Corporation totaling $48 million and had proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $19 million, principally real estate. The company’s discontinued operations provided cash of $31 million from investing activities, principally the sale of Genevac Limited. The company’s financing activities used $929 million of cash during 2007, principally for the repayment of $464 million of short-term debt and the repurchase of $898 million of the company’s common stock, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $345 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $97 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Financial Statement Index 47 Table of Contents 2006 Cash provided by operating activities was $406 million during 2006, including $407 million provided by continuing operations. A reduction in current liabilities used cash of $80 million, primarily as a result of merger-related payments made following completion of the transaction totaling $157 million, including executive severance and retirement benefits, and transaction costs incurred by Fisher, offset in part by an increase in other accrued expenses. Cash of $32 million was provided by collections on accounts receivable. Payments for restructuring actions of the company’s continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $30 million during 2006. During 2006, the primary investing activities of the company’s continuing operations, excluding available-for-sale investment activities, included acquisitions, the purchase of property, plant and equipment and the sale of product lines. Cash acquired in the merger with Fisher totaled $360 million, net of transaction costs. The company expended $132 million on acquisitions and $77 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company partially liquidated assets totaling $40 million in a Fisher retirement trust to fund payments that were due to former Fisher executives following the merger. The company had proceeds from the sale of product lines of $9 million. Investing activities of the company’s discontinued operations provided $5 million of cash during 2006, primarily additional proceeds from a business divested prior to 2004. The company’s financing activities used $260 million of cash during 2006, principally for the repurchase of $300 million of the company’s common stock and the repayment of $335 million of debt, offset in part by short-term borrowing and proceeds of stock option exercises. The company increased short-term borrowings by $177 million in 2006. The company had proceeds of $180 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $17 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2006 - 2008 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $3 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the company’s own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the company’s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2008.

(b) For the purpose of this calculation, amounts assume interest rates on floating rate obligations remain unchanged from levels at December 31, 2008, throughout the life of the obligation. (c) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (d) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $70 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2009, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $230 - $250 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business – Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Financial Statement Index 49 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward contracts to manage certain exposures to currencies. The company enters into forward currency-exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than its subsidiaries’ local currencies. The company does not engage in extensive currency hedging activities; however, the purpose of the company’s currency hedging activities is to protect the company’s local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The company’s forward currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euros, U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Danish krone and Australian dollars. Income and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative currency agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2008, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s long-term debt at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 was $2.131 billion and $3.004 billion, respectively. Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s long-term debt at December 31, 2008 would increase by approximately $52 million. In 2007, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of the company’s debt by approximately $61 million. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments. A 100-basis-point increase in 90-day LIBOR at December 31, 2008 and 2007, would increase the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by $3.4 million and $4.7 million, respectively. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the company’s reporting currency as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros, British pounds sterling and Japanese yen. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2008 and 2007 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $306 million and $297 million, respectively. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2008 and 2007 currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $24 million and $22 million, respectively. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Financial Statement Index 50 Table of Contents Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2008 and 2007 currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $8 million and $26 million, respectively, on the company’s net income. Equity Prices The company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in price. In addition, the company’s convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the company’s common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company’s available-for-sale investments and convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year-end 2008 and 2007 market equity prices would increase the fair value of the company’s convertible obligations by $81 million and $180 million, respectively.",2023-12-30 17:37:57.129045
97745,TMO,THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.,2010,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reference is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report. Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s continuing operations fall into two business segments: Analytical Technologies and Laboratory Products and Services. During each of the first quarters of 2009 and 2008, the company transferred management responsibility and related financial reporting and monitoring for a small product line between segments. The company has historically moved a product line between segments when a shift in strategic focus of either the product line or a segment more closely aligns the product line with a segment different than that in which it had previously been reported. Segment information for all periods presented has been reclassified to reflect these transfers. Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government customers. (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,153.9 41.1% $ 4,468.6 42.6% Laboratory Products and Services 6,426.6 63.6% 6,455.2 61.5% Eliminations (470.8 ) (4.7)% (425.8 ) (4.1)% $ 10,109.7 100% $ 10,498.0 100% Sales in 2009 were $10.11 billion, a decrease of $388 million from 2008. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures (discussed in total and by segment below), revenues decreased from 2008 revenues by $342 million (3%) due to lower revenues at existing businesses as a result of decreased demand, offset in part by price increases. Sales of equipment and, to a lesser extent, services were particularly affected as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global market downturn. Sales of consumables grew modestly, however, and were not as significantly affected by the severe economic conditions. The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2009 and 2008. The principal acquisitions in 2009 were Biolab, an Australia-based provider of analytical instruments, life science consumables and laboratory equipment in April 2009 and B.R.A.H.M.S. AG, a leading provider of specialty diagnostic tests based on patented biomarkers for sepsis, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, as well as intensive care treatments and prenatal screening in October 2009. Biolab broadened the geographic reach of the company’s customer channels. BRAHMS increased the breadth of the company’s specialty diagnostics portfolio and provided a significant reagent manufacturing center in Europe. In 2009, operating income and operating income margin were $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, compared with $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, in 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to lower profitability at existing businesses resulting from decreased revenues offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. In addition, restructuring and other costs increased $32 million in 2009 due primarily to a pension plan curtailment gain in the 2008 period and, to a lesser extent, increased cost reduction measures in 2009 due to the economic downturn. Financial Statement Index 33 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) The company’s effective tax rates were 8.2% and 13.5% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of newly enacted tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2010 will be between 17% and 19% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by $28 million or 2.5 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of a change in the apportionment of state rates and newly enacted reductions in tax rates in Switzerland. Income from continuing operations decreased to $851 million in 2009, from $975 million in 2008, primarily due to the items discussed above that decreased operating income, offset in part by a lower tax rate. During 2009, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $1.66 billion, compared with $1.42 billion for 2008. The increase resulted primarily from decreased investment in working capital items, particularly accounts receivable and inventories. As of December 31, 2009, the company’s outstanding debt totaled $2.18 billion, of which approximately $0.66 billion is convertible debt, at conversion prices ranging from $23.73 to $40.20 per share. As of December 31, 2009, $340 million of the convertible debt was currently convertible. During 2009 and early 2010, holders of debentures totaling $68 million in par value exercised conversion rights. Upon an investor’s election to convert, the company is required to pay the original principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the company's election. For any holders electing to convert in 2010, the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $113 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The facility is an unsecured revolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $946 million at December 31, 2009. The company believes that its existing cash and short-term investments of $1.57 billion as of December 31, 2009, and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to equity investments, bad debts, sales returns, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, warranty obligations, income taxes, pension costs, contingencies and litigation, stock-based compensation, restructuring and sale of businesses. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Financial Statement Index 34 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: (a) Accounts Receivable The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such allowances totaled $47 million at December 31, 2009. The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. (b) Inventories The company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required. (c) Intangible Assets and Goodwill The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. A significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets that require the use of significant judgment in determining (i) fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Amortizable intangible assets totaled $5.01 billion at December 31, 2009. The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $8.98 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2009. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. Financial Statement Index 35 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company’s businesses were adversely affected in 2009 by the global economic downturn, although results progressively improved during the year. Projections of profitability for 2010 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at December 31, 2009. There can be no assurance, however, that indicators of economic recovery will continue into 2010 and that a prolonged downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary. (d) Other Long-lived Assets The company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Other long-lived assets totaled $1.77 billion at December 31, 2009, including $1.33 billion of fixed assets. In testing a long-lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset-related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long-lived assets may be necessary. (e) Revenues In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change, the company’s revenue recognition would be affected. If fair value is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements is completed. In instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing. The company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or “elements.” The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately. The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required. Financial Statement Index 36 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) (f) Warranty Obligations At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for warranty obligations of the company’s continuing operations totaled $45 million at December 31, 2009. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary. (g) Income Taxes In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized. The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income. The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $164.8 million at December 31, 2009. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Accrued income taxes totaled $28 million at December 31, 2009. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the company’s tax provision would result. Financial Statement Index 37 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) (h) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Reserves of acquired businesses, including environmental reserves, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. (i) Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Several of the company’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $16 million in 2009. The company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $225 million at year-end 2009 compared with $303 million at year-end 2008. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $85 million. The company expects to contribute between $20 and $30 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2010. (j) Stock-based Compensation The fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock. The expected lives of option grants through 2007 were estimated using the simplified method for “plain vanilla” options. Thereafter, historical data on exercise patterns became the basis for determining the expected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock-based compensation. The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures. If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required. Financial Statement Index 38 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) (k) Restructuring Costs The company records restructuring charges for the cost of vacating facilities based on future lease obligations net of expected sub-rental income. The company’s accrued restructuring costs for abandoned facilities totaled $7 million at December 31, 2009. Should actual cash flows associated with sub-rental income from vacated facilities vary from estimated amounts, adjustments may be required. (l) Assets Held for Sale The company estimates the expected proceeds from any assets held for sale and, when necessary, records losses to reduce the carrying value of these assets to estimated realizable value. Should the actual or estimated proceeds, which would include post-closing purchase price adjustments, vary from current estimates, results could differ from expected amounts. Results of Operations 2009 Compared With 2008 Continuing Operations Sales in 2009 were $10.11 billion, a decrease of $388 million from 2008. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $211 million in 2009. Sales increased $165 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $342 million (3%) primarily a result of decreased demand which the company believes was due to economic uncertainty offset in part by price increases, as described by segment below. Sales of equipment and, to a lesser extent, services were particularly affected as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global market downturn. Sales of consumables grew modestly, however, and were not as significantly affected by the severe economic conditions. Sales were down in North America and Europe but grew modestly in Asia. In the latter part of 2009, the dollar weakened against other major currencies in which the company sells products and services. Weakening of the dollar had a favorable effect on revenues of the company of approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. In 2009, operating income and operating income margin were $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, compared with $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, in 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to lower profitability at existing businesses resulting from decreased revenues offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. In addition, restructuring and other costs increased $32 million in 2009 due primarily to a pension plan curtailment gain in the 2008 period and, to a lesser extent, increased cost reduction measures in 2009 due to the economic downturn. In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Biolab and B.R.A.H.M.S. on April 30, and October 1, 2009, respectively, offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain pre-merger Fisher product liability-related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge Financial Statement Index 39 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations (continued) for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation-related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006 (Note 14). In 2008, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $37 million, including $2 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $38 million of cash costs primarily for severance to reduce headcount at several businesses in response to economic uncertainty and a decline in financial markets and for abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded a $7 million charge for the impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets associated with a small business unit acquired as part of Fisher, a $5 million loss from a litigation-related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher, a $3 million net loss on the sale of businesses and a $3 million charge for in-process research and development at an acquired business. These charges were offset by a $19 million gain on the curtailment of part of a pension plan in the U.S. As of February 26, 2010, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $38 million in 2010 and expects to identify additional actions during 2010. The restructuring actions initiated in 2009 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $107 million, including $59 million for actions taken through the end of 2009 and $48 million for actions that have been approved and will be completed in 2010. Of the $107 million of total savings, $63 million is in the Analytical Technologies segment and $44 million is in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions initiated in 2008 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of 2008 and early 2009 of approximately $34 million, including $26 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $8 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The company's revenues and profitability decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 although results progressively improved during 2009. The company believes the decreases were primarily due to the global economic downturn. There can be no assurance that indicators of economic recovery will continue into 2010 and that a prolonged downturn will not affect the company's projections of profitability for 2010 and future years. If actual results decrease materially from projected results, impairment of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets could occur. These assets totaled $8.98 billion and $6.34 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2009. Segment Results The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses these measures because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis. Financial Statement Index 40 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations (continued) (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Change Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,153.9 $ 4,468.6 (7)% Laboratory Products and Services 6,426.6 6,455.2 0% Eliminations (470.8 ) (425.8 ) 11% Consolidated Revenues $ 10,109.7 $ 10,498.0 (4)% Segment Income Analytical Technologies $ 837.3 $ 955.3 (12)% Laboratory Products and Services 877.6 913.8 (4)% Subtotal Reportable Segments 1,714.9 1,869.1 (8)% Cost of Revenues Charges (6.7 ) (1.5 ) Selling, General and Administrative Charges, Net (1.5 ) — Restructuring and Other Costs, Net (60.8 ) (35.4 ) Amortization of Acquisition-related Intangible Assets (597.0 ) (602.8 ) Consolidated Operating Income $ 1,048.9 $ 1,229.4 (15)% Income from the company’s reportable segments decreased 8% to $1.71 billion in 2009 due primarily to lower profitability at existing businesses, resulting from decreased revenues offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income. Analytical Technologies (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Change Revenues $ 4,153.9 $ 4,468.6 (7)% Operating Income Margin 20.2% 21.4% (1.2) Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment decreased $315 million to $4.15 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $92 million in 2009. Sales increased $44 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $267 million (6%) primarily due to lower demand offset in part by increased prices. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control instruments was particularly weak, which the company believes was due to the global economic downturn. The decrease in sales of these products was offset in part by higher demand for bioscience offerings and diagnostic products, including flu tests. Operating income margin was 20.2% in 2009 and 21.4% in 2008. The decrease resulted from lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Financial Statement Index 41 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations (continued) Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Change Revenues $ 6,426.6 $ 6,455.2 0% Operating Income Margin 13.7% 14.2% (0.5) Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment decreased $29 million to $6.43 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $128 million in 2009. Sales increased $121 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $22 million primarily due to a decrease in sales of products purchased from a supplier discussed below, offset in part by increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment was weak as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global economic downturn, however, this was more than offset by higher demand for products purchased through the company’s research market and healthcare market channels. In July 2008, the company and a significant supplier of its healthcare market channel extended an existing agreement for two years through 2010. Under the revised agreement, the company’s revenues from the sale of products purchased from the supplier decreased $61 million in 2009 to $205 million. In November 2009, the supplier notified the company that it intended to cease the current arrangement. The company believes this was in part a response to the company’s strategic decision to expand its product offerings to provide its customers with a broader menu of diagnostic solutions. As a result of the supplier terminating this agreement, the company expects sales of related products to be approximately $75 million in 2010 and none thereafter. The company has signed an agreement with an alternative supplier of laboratory products and expects to sell approximately $40 million of these and other products from the new supplier in 2010, offsetting a portion of the anticipated drop in revenue. Operating income margin decreased to 13.7% in 2009 from 14.2% in 2008, primarily due to lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $122 million and $101 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively (Note 4). Interest income decreased to $16 million in 2009 from $52 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances. Interest expense decreased to $118 million from $152 million in 2008 primarily as a result of a reduction in average debt and lower interest rates on variable rate debt. In 2009, other expense, net, includes a $15 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 9). Provision for Income Taxes The company’s effective tax rates were 8.2% and 13.5% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of newly enacted tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2010 will be between 17% and 19% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by $28 million or 2.5 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of a change in the apportionment of state rates and newly enacted reductions in tax rates in Switzerland. Financial Statement Index 42 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations (continued) Contingent Liabilities At the end of 2009, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the matters described under “Litigation and Related Contingencies” in Note 10 could materially affect the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued a pronouncement concerning fair value measurement accounting. This guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The rule applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements but does not require any new fair value measurements. The pronouncement was effective for the company’s monetary assets and liabilities in the first quarter of 2008 and for non-financial assets and liabilities beginning January 1, 2009. There was no material effect from adoption. In December 2007, the FASB revised the accounting rules concerning business combinations. This revised guidance does the following: requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; and requires the acquirer to disclose certain information to enable users to understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. The rules require that cash outflows such as transaction costs and post-acquisition restructuring be charged to expense instead of capitalized as a cost of the acquisition. Contingent purchase price is recorded at its initial fair value and then re-measured periodically through adjustments to net income. The revised guidance was effective for the company, on a prospective basis, beginning January 1, 2009. There was no impact upon adoption; however, the rule changes may materially affect the accounting for any future business combinations. In December 2007, the FASB issued new rules on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. The noncontrolling interest guidance changed the accounting for minority interests, which are reclassified as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. This guidance was effective for the company beginning January 1, 2009, and there was no effect from adoption. In March 2008, the FASB issued a pronouncement pertaining to disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities. This guidance requires disclosures of how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for; and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The rule was effective for the company beginning January 1, 2009, and there was no material effect from adoption. In May 2008, the FASB issued new rules on the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion, including partial cash settlement of such debt instruments. The rules require the issuers of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components in a manner that reflects the issuer's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. The new guidance was effective for the company beginning January 1, 2009. The rules required adjustment of prior periods to conform to current accounting. The company’s cash payments for interest have not been affected, but adoption increased the company’s reported interest expense for all periods presented in a manner that reflects interest rates of similar non-convertible debt. Interest expense in 2008 and 2007, as adjusted for adoption of this rule, increased $22 million and $21 million, respectively, over the previously reported amounts. Financial Statement Index 43 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations (continued) In June 2008, the FASB issued guidance on determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities. This guidance clarifies that share-based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive nonforfeitable dividends before vesting should be considered participating securities. The guidance was effective for the company beginning January 1, 2009. The rule required adjustment of prior periods to conform to current accounting. Adoption had a nominal effect on the numerator and, for diluted presentation, the denominator in the calculation of earnings per share for all periods presented. In December 2008, the FASB issued guidance which requires additional disclosures about an employer’s plan assets of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. This rule expands current disclosures of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan assets to include information regarding the fair value measurements of plan assets. The guidance was effective for the company beginning in January 2009 and the additional disclosures have been made. In April 2009, the FASB issued guidance on the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments. This guidance amends the prior other-than-temporary impairment guidance for certain debt securities and will require the investor to assess the likelihood of selling the debt security prior to recovery of its cost basis. If an investor is able to meet the criteria to assert that it does not intend to sell the debt security and more likely than not will not be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery, impairment charges related to credit losses would be recognized in earnings whereas impairment charges related to non-credit losses would be reflected in other comprehensive income. The company elected early adoption of this rule in the first quarter of 2009. Adoption did not materially affect the company’s financial statements. In April 2009, the FASB issued guidance on providing interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments. This new guidance requires the fair value disclosures that were previously disclosed only annually to be disclosed now on an interim basis. This guidance was effective for the company in the second quarter of 2009, and the additional disclosures have been made. In May 2009, the FASB issued a pronouncement on subsequent event accounting that establishes the period after the balance sheet date during which management shall evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements; the circumstances under which an entity shall recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements; and the disclosures that an entity shall make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The pronouncement was effective for the company’s second quarter 2009, and there was no effect from adoption. In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance on the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles. The FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or the Codification, is the single source of authoritative nongovernmental generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP). The Codification was effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption of the Codification had no impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations. In September 2009, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued new rules pertaining to the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple customer deliverables and for software-enabled products. The new rule pertaining to arrangements under which the company has multiple customer deliverables provides an alternative method for establishing the fair value of a deliverable when vendor specific objective evidence does not exist. The guidance requires the determination of the best estimate of selling price to separate deliverables and allows the allocation of the customer’s consideration using this relative Financial Statement Index 44 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations (continued) selling price model. The new guidance pertaining to software-enabled products revised the existing software accounting guidance to exclude equipment where the software is more than incidental to the value of the product. Upon adoption of the new standard, such equipment will be accounted for under revenue recognition criteria applicable to equipment instead of that applicable to software. Both of these new rules can be prospectively applied beginning January 1, 2011 or can be early or retrospectively adopted. The company expects to adopt both of these new rules effective January 1, 2010. Adoption of these new standards is not expected to materially affect the company’s financial statements. Discontinued Operations During 2008, the company recorded additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after-tax gain of $6 million. The note was collected in July 2008. 2008 Compared With 2007 Continuing Operations Sales in 2008 were $10.50 billion, an increase of $752 million from 2007. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $113 million in 2008. Sales increased $186 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effect of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $453 million primarily due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, price increases, as described by segment below. Growth was very strong in Asia, moderate in North America and modest in Europe although in the fourth quarter of 2008, growth slowed in Asia and improved in Europe. In the latter part of 2008, the U.S. dollar strengthened against other major currencies in which the company sells product and services. Strengthening of the dollar had a negative effect on the amount of revenues the company reported in U.S. dollars of approximately 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008. In 2008, operating income and operating income margin were $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, compared with $974 million and 10.0%, respectively, in 2007. The increase in operating income was due to higher profitability at existing businesses resulting from incremental revenues including price increases, merger integration savings and productivity improvements including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. The increase also resulted from $48 million of lower cost of revenues charges, primarily merger-related, and from $7 million of lower restructuring and other costs in 2008, principally due to a curtailment gain in 2008 associated with a pension plan in the U.S. These increases were offset in part by a $32 million increase in amortization expense as a result of acquisition-related intangible assets from 2007 and 2008 acquisitions. Restructuring and other costs were recorded during 2008 and 2007. In 2008, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $37 million, including $2 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $38 million of cash costs primarily for severance to reduce headcount at several businesses in response to economic uncertainty and a decline in financial markets and for abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded a $7 million charge for the impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets associated with a small business unit acquired as part of Fisher, a $5 million loss from a litigation-related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher, a $3 million net loss on the sale of businesses and a $3 million charge for in-process research and development at an acquired business. These charges were offset by a $19 million gain on the curtailment of part of a pension plan in the U.S. In 2007, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $91 million, Financial Statement Index 45 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations (continued) including $49 million of charges to cost of revenues, substantially all related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition (principally Fisher). The company incurred $40 million of cash costs, primarily for severance, abandoned facilities and relocation expenses at businesses that have been consolidated. The company also recorded $2 million of loss on sale of a small business unit. The restructuring actions initiated in 2007 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $11 million, primarily in the Analytical Technologies segment. Segment Results (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Change Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,468.6 $ 4,179.1 7% Laboratory Products and Services 6,455.2 5,913.1 9% Eliminations (425.8 ) (345.8 ) 23% Consolidated Revenues $ 10,498.0 $ 9,746.4 8% Segment Income Analytical Technologies $ 955.3 $ 823.6 16% Laboratory Products and Services 913.8 813.3 12% Subtotal Reportable Segments 1,869.1 1,636.9 14% Cost of Revenues Charges (1.5 ) (49.2 ) Restructuring and Other Costs, Net (35.4 ) (42.2 ) Amortization of Acquisition-related Intangible Assets (602.8 ) (571.1 ) Consolidated Operating Income $ 1,229.4 $ 974.4 26% Income from the company’s reportable segments increased 14% to $1.87 billion in 2008 due primarily to higher profitability at existing businesses, resulting from incremental revenues including price increases and productivity improvements including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. This improvement was offset in part by higher commodity prices. Analytical Technologies (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Change Revenues $ 4,468.6 $ 4,179.1 7% Operating Income Margin 21.4% 19.7% 1.7 Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $290 million to $4.47 billion in 2008. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase of $74 million in 2008. Sales increased $42 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $174 million primarily due to higher demand and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. The higher demand was due, in part, to the introduction of new products. Growth was particularly strong in sales of scientific instruments and specialty diagnostics. Sales growth slowed in the latter part of 2008 due to lower fourth quarter sales of environmental monitoring equipment and process instruments which were unfavorably affected by a downturn in industrial markets. Financial Statement Index 46 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations (continued) Operating income margin was 21.4% in 2008 and 19.7% in 2007. The increase resulted from profit on incremental revenues and, to a lesser extent, price increases and productivity improvements, including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 Change Revenues $ 6,455.2 $ 5,913.1 9% Operating Income Margin 14.2% 13.8% 0.4 Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $542 million to $6.46 billion in 2008. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase of $39 million in 2008. Sales increased $163 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $340 million primarily due to higher demand and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. Sales made through the segment’s research market and healthcare market channels and revenues from the company’s biopharma services were particularly strong. These increases in revenue were offset in part by lower sales in early 2008 made through the segment’s safety market channel. The safety market channel sales are in part dependent on expenditures for homeland security that vary based on government spending priorities. Operating income margin increased to 14.2% in 2008 from 13.8% in 2007, primarily due to profit on incremental revenue and, to a lesser extent, price increases and productivity improvements, including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring actions, offset in part by the impact of inflation on commodities such as raw resin, steel and plastics as well as higher fuel and freight costs. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $101 million and $114 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Other expense, net, includes interest income, interest expense, gain on investments, net, equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and other items, net. The decrease was primarily due to $9 million of lower interest expense as a result of reduced market rates on variable rate debt and redemption of $129 million of long-term debt due in October 2008. Provision for Income Taxes The company’s effective tax rate was 13.5% and 10.9% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by $28 million or 2.5 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of a change in the apportionment of state tax rates and newly enacted reductions in tax rates in Switzerland. Aside from the impact of these items, the tax rate was unfavorably affected by an increase in income in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2007 was favorably affected by $32 million or 3.7 percentage points resulting from enacted reductions in tax rates in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Canada and Germany on the company’s deferred tax balances. Financial Statement Index 47 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations (continued) Discontinued Operations During 2008, the company recorded additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after-tax gain of $6 million. The note was collected in July 2008. In 2007, the company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $29 million on a business held for sale and subsequently sold. The loss primarily represented the carrying value of the business in excess of the estimated disposal value. Aside from the impairment loss, the company had after-tax gains of $10 million in 2007 from discontinued operations, primarily from the receipt of additional proceeds from the sale of a business in 2000 and a revision to the company’s estimate of loss from litigation related to a divested business. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $2.89 billion at December 31, 2009, compared with $2.81 billion at December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.57 billion at December 31, 2009 and $1.29 billion at December 31, 2008. 2009 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.66 billion during 2009. Decreases in accounts receivable and inventory provided cash of $127 million and $108 million, respectively. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $45 million. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted primarily from improved collections and the decrease in inventories resulted primarily from increased fourth quarter shipments in 2009 over the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $51 million during 2009. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $330 million and $292 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, the company’s primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $637 million for acquisitions and $208 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. In January and February 2010, the company entered agreements to acquire three businesses for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $225 million and future contingent consideration of up to an additional $30 million. The company’s financing activities used $558 million of cash during 2009, principally for the extinguishment of debt and the repurchase of $415 million of the company’s common stock, offset in part by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $748 million. In December 2009, the company redeemed all of the $300 million principal outstanding on its 6.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 at a redemption price of 103.375% for a total cash outlay of $317 million including accrued interest. Also in December 2009, the company repurchased in a tender offer $282 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.50% convertible Senior Notes due 2023 at $2,072.4743 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $587 million including accrued and unpaid interest (Note 9). The company’s financing activities also included $54 million of proceeds of employee stock option exercises. On September 11, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of the company’s common stock through September 10, 2009. At December 31, 2009, no remaining authorization existed for repurchases of the company’s common stock. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2010, such expenditures will approximate $275 to $300 million. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) As of December 31, 2009, the company’s outstanding debt totaled $2.18 billion, of which approximately $0.66 billion is convertible debt, at conversion prices ranging from $23.73 to $40.20 per share. As of December 31, 2009, $340 million of the convertible debt was currently convertible. During 2009 and early 2010, holders of debentures totaling $68 million in par value exercised conversion rights. Upon an investor’s election to convert, the company is required to pay the original principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the company's election. For any holders electing to convert in 2010, the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $113 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The facility is an unsecured revolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $946 million at December 31, 2009. The company believes that its existing cash and short-term investments of $1.57 billion as of December 31, 2009, and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2008 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.42 billion during 2008. A decrease in accounts payable used $124 million of cash due to the timing of payments at year-end. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $51 million and $50 million, respectively, representing working capital increases associated with the growth in revenues. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $292 million in 2008 compared with $125 million in 2007, primarily as a result of no longer having tax loss carryforwards in the U.S. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $36 million during 2008. During 2008, the company’s primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $201 million for acquisitions and $264 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities used $228 million of cash during 2008, principally for the repurchase of $187 million of the company’s common stock and repayment of $151 million of debt, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $85 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $25 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. 2007 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.48 billion during 2007. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $125 million in 2007. The company did not make significant U.S. estimated tax payments in 2007, primarily due to tax deductions for merger-related stock-based compensation and net operating loss carryforwards. The company made $78 million of merger related payments in 2007, which reduced operating cash. Payments for restructuring actions of the company’s continuing operations, principally severance, lease costs and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $40 million during 2007. During 2007, the primary investing activities of the company’s continuing operations were acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $497 million on acquisitions and $176 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company collected a note receivable from Newport Corporation totaling $48 million and had proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $19 million, principally real estate. The company’s discontinued operations provided cash of $31 million from investing activities, principally the sale of Genevac Limited. Financial Statement Index 49 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company’s financing activities used $929 million of cash during 2007, principally for the repayment of $464 million of short-term debt and the repurchase of $898 million of the company’s common stock, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $345 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $97 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2007 - 2009 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $3.5 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the company’s own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the company’s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2009. Payments due by Period or Expiration of Commitment (In millions) 2010 2011 and 2012 2013 and 2014 2015 and Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments Debt principal, including short-term debt (a) $ 117.0 $ 354.4 $ 411.7 $ 1,317.8 $ 2,200.9 Interest (b) 62.2 122.3 116.5 119.1 420.1 Capital lease obligations 0.9 0.9 0.1 — 1.9 Operating lease obligations 99.8 138.4 68.2 67.5 373.9 Unconditional purchase obligations (c) 155.7 13.7 2.8 — 172.2 Letters of credit and bank guarantees 76.9 11.6 0.4 11.8 100.7 Surety bonds and other guarantees 38.7 7.2 — — 45.9 Pension obligations on balance sheet 23.5 51.3 57.6 95.9 228.3 Asset retirement obligations 5.1 3.7 2.7 11.0 22.5 Other (d) 7.7 — — — 7.7 $ 587.5 $ 703.5 $ 660.0 $ 1,623.1 $ 3,574.1 (a) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for debt and do not include any deferred issuance costs. (b) For the purpose of this calculation, amounts assume interest rates on floating rate obligations remain unchanged from levels at December 31, 2009, throughout the life of the obligation. (c) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (d) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. Financial Statement Index 50 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $76.2 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2010, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $275 to $300 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business – Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts to manage certain exposures to currencies and commodities. The company enters into these derivative contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than its subsidiaries’ local currencies or impacted by commodity price movement. The company engages in limited hedging activities primarily to protect the company’s cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and from volatility in commodity prices. The company’s currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Euros, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen and Australian dollars. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2009, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the Financial Statement Index 51 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) company’s debt at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 was $2.56 billion and $2.15 billion, respectively. Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2009 would increase by approximately $68 million. In 2008, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of the company’s debt by approximately $52 million. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. A 100-basis-point increase in 90-day LIBOR at December 31, 2009 and 2008, would increase the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $8 million and $3 million, respectively. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the company’s reporting currency as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in Euros, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Chinese yuan and British pounds sterling. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2009 and 2008 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $374 million and $306 million, respectively. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2009 and 2008 currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $39 million and $24 million, respectively. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2009 and 2008 currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $7 million and $8 million, respectively, on the company’s net income. Equity Prices The company’s available-for-sale investment portfolio includes equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in price. In addition, the company’s convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the company’s common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company’s available-for-sale investments and convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year-end 2009 and 2008 market equity prices would increase the fair value of the company’s convertible obligations by $87 million and $81 million, respectively.",2023-12-30 17:37:42.932392
97745,TMO,THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.,2011,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reference is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report. Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s continuing operations fall into two business segments: Analytical Technologies and Laboratory Products and Services. Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to capital spending patterns of customers. (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,611.8 42.7% $ 4,153.9 41.1% Laboratory Products and Services 6,693.0 62.0% 6,426.6 63.6% Eliminations (516.1) (4.7)% (470.8) (4.7)% $ 10,788.7 100% $ 10,109.7 100% Sales in 2010 were $10.79 billion, an increase of $679 million from 2009. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures (discussed in total and by segment below), revenues increased from 2009 revenues by $433 million (4%) due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher stimulus-funded spending by customers and price increases. Sales rebounded from a weak 2009 when the company believes a global economic slowdown reduced demand. The increase in revenues was offset by lower sales resulting from cessation of a supply contract and a milder flu season than in 2009, as discussed below. These factors decreased sales by approximately 2 percentage points. The company estimates that stimulus-funded spending increased revenues by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010, primarily in the first quarter. The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2010 and 2009. The company’s principal acquisitions are described below. · Fermentas, a manufacturer and global distributor of enzymes, reagents and kits for molecular and cellular biology research, was acquired in July 2010 to expand the company’s ability to provide complete workflows for genomics research. · Finnzymes, a provider of integrated tools for molecular biology analysis, including reagents, instruments, consumables and kits, was acquired in March 2010 to expand the company’s portfolio of reagents and other consumables for the molecular biology research and diagnostics markets. · Ahura Scientific, a provider of handheld spectroscopy instruments that are used worldwide in the identification of chemicals for safety, security and pharmaceutical applications, was acquired in February 2010 to expand the company’s portfolio of portable analytical devices. · B.R.A.H.M.S. AG, a leading provider of specialty diagnostic tests based on patented biomarkers for sepsis, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, as well as intensive care treatments and prenatal screening, was acquired in October 2009 to increase the breadth of the company’s specialty diagnostics portfolio and provide a significant reagent manufacturing center in Europe. · Biolab, an Australia-based provider of analytical instruments, life science consumables and laboratory equipment, was acquired in April 2009 to broaden the geographic reach of the company’s customer channels. Financial Statement Index 34 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) On December 13, 2010, the company and Dionex Corporation, a leading manufacturer and marketer of chromatography systems, announced that their Boards of Directors unanimously approved a transaction under which Thermo Fisher will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Dionex for $118.50 per share in cash, or a total purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion. Dionex, headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, is a global leader in the manufacturing and marketing of liquid chromatography and sample preparation systems, consumables, and software for chemical analysis. Dionex systems are used worldwide in environmental analysis and by the life sciences, chemical, petrochemical, food and beverage, power generation, and electronics industries. Their expertise in applications and instrumentation helps analytical scientists to evaluate and develop pharmaceuticals, establish environmental regulations, and produce better industrial products. The transaction is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. In 2010, operating income and operating income margin were $1.26 billion and 11.7%, respectively, compared with $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, in 2009. The increases in operating income and operating margin were due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. In addition, amortization expense decreased by $25 million in 2010, primarily due to the completion of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles from a 2005 acquisition. The company’s effective tax rates were 11.3% and 8.2% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by $17.4 million or 1.5 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2011 will be between 15.5% and 17.5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. Income from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010, from $851 million in 2009, primarily due to the items discussed above that increased operating income, offset in part by a higher tax rate. During 2010, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $1.50 billion, compared with $1.66 billion for 2009. The decrease resulted primarily from increases in working capital items, particularly accounts receivable and inventories to support the growth in sales. As of December 31, 2010, the company’s outstanding debt totaled $2.14 billion, of which approximately $0.33 billion is convertible debt, at a conversion price of $40.20 per share. Upon an investor’s election to convert, the company is required to pay the principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the company's election. For any holders electing to convert in the next 12 months or electing to put the debt to the company at the first date on which this is permitted (March 2011), the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $100 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The facility is an unsecured revolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $952 million at December 31, 2010. In December 2010, the company obtained short-term financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund $1.5 billion of the purchase price of Dionex. However, in February 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion of senior notes with maturities of 3 – 10 years, primarily to fund the purchase of Dionex, and subsequently terminated the short-term financing commitment. If the company does not consummate the Dionex acquisition by September 30, 2011, the company will be required to redeem these notes in whole at a redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Financial Statement Index 35 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) The company believes that its existing cash and short-term investments of $926 million as of December 31, 2010, and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, equity investments, sales returns, warranty obligations, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, pension costs and stock-based compensation. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: (a) Accounts Receivable The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such allowances totaled $40 million at December 31, 2010. The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. (b) Inventories The company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required. (c) Intangible Assets and Goodwill The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. A significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets that require the use of significant judgment in determining (i) fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Amortizable intangible assets totaled $4.71 billion at December 31, 2010. The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. Financial Statement Index 36 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $9.27 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The company’s businesses were adversely affected in 2009 by the global economic downturn, although results progressively improved during the year and in 2010. Projections of profitability for 2011 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at December 31, 2010. There can be no assurance, however, that an economic recovery will continue into 2011 and that a downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary. (d) Other Long-lived Assets The company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Other long-lived assets totaled $1.90 billion at December 31, 2010, including $1.41 billion of fixed assets. In testing a long-lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset-related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long-lived assets may be necessary. (e) Revenues In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change, the company’s revenue recognition would be affected. Financial Statement Index 37 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) In instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing. The company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or “elements.” The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately. The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required. (f) Warranty Obligations At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for warranty obligations of the company’s continuing operations totaled $42 million at December 31, 2010. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary. (g) Income Taxes In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. The company’s reserve for these matters totaled $62 million at December 31, 2010. Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized. The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income. Financial Statement Index 38 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $156 million at December 31, 2010. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Accrued income taxes totaled $59 million at December 31, 2010. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the company’s tax provision would result. (h) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Reserves of acquired businesses, including environmental reserves, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. (i) Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Several of the company’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $14 million in 2010. The company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $244 million at year-end 2010 compared with $225 million at year-end 2009. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $4 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $84 million. The company expects to contribute between $20 and $30 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2011. Financial Statement Index 39 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) (j) Stock-based Compensation The fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for determining the expected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock-based compensation. The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures. If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required. Results of Operations 2010 Compared With 2009 Continuing Operations Total Currency Acquisitions/ (In millions) 2010 2009 Change Translation Divestitures Operations Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 $ 457.9 $ (21.0 ) $ 232.0 $ 246.9 Laboratory Products and Services 6,693.0 6,426.6 266.4 — 34.0 232.4 Eliminations (516.1 ) (470.8 ) (45.3 ) 1.0 — (46.3 ) Consolidated Revenues $ 10,788.7 $ 10,109.7 $ 679.0 $ (20.0 ) $ 266.0 $ 433.0 Sales in 2010 were $10.79 billion, an increase of $679 million from 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $20 million in 2010. Sales increased $266 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $433 million (4%) due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher stimulus-funded spending by customers and price increases. Sales rebounded from a weak 2009 when the company believes a global economic slowdown reduced demand. Sales growth was strong in Asia, moderate in North America and modest in Europe in 2010. The increase in revenues was offset in part by cessation of a supply contract and a milder flu season in 2010 which together unfavorably affected revenue growth by 2 percentage points in 2010. The company estimates that stimulus-funded spending increased revenues by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010, primarily in the first quarter. In 2010, operating income and operating income margin were $1.26 billion and 11.7%, respectively, compared with $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, in 2009. The increases in operating income and operating margin were due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. In addition, amortization expense decreased by $25 million in 2010, primarily due to the completion of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles from a 2005 acquisition. Financial Statement Index 40 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations (continued) In 2010, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $79 million, including: $16 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $3 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs, net, primarily related to the pending acquisition of Dionex and revisions of estimated contingent consideration, principally related to the acquisition of Ahura Scientific, offset in part by a gain of $11 million on settlement with product liability insurers. The company incurred $34 million of cash costs, primarily for actions initiated in 2009 and, to a lesser extent, 2010 in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company recorded impairment charges of $17 million for intangible assets associated with several small business units. The company also recorded a $6 million charge on a patent infringement claim initiated prior to a business unit’s acquisition by the company and $3 million of asset write-downs associated with abandoned facilities held for sale (Note 14). In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Biolab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain product liability-related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation-related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006. As of February 24, 2011, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $35 million in 2011 and expects to identify additional actions during 2011. The restructuring actions initiated in 2010 will result in annual cost savings of approximately $50 million beginning primarily in 2011, including $15 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $35 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions initiated in 2009 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of 2009 and early 2010 of approximately $60 million, including $40 million in the Analytical Technologies segment and $20 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. Segment Results The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses these measures because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis. Financial Statement Index 41 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations (continued) (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 11% Laboratory Products and Services 6,693.0 6,426.6 4% Eliminations (516.1 ) (470.8 ) 10% Consolidated Revenues $ 10,788.7 $ 10,109.7 7% Segment Income Analytical Technologies $ 984.2 $ 837.3 18% Laboratory Products and Services 931.8 877.6 6% Subtotal Reportable Segments 1,916.0 1,714.9 12% Cost of Revenues Charges (16.0 ) (6.7 ) Selling, General and Administrative Charges, Net (3.0 ) (1.5 ) Restructuring and Other Costs, Net (60.4 ) (60.8 ) Amortization of Acquisition-related Intangible Assets (571.7 ) (597.0 ) Consolidated Operating Income $ 1,264.9 $ 1,048.9 21% Reportable Segments Operating Income Margin 17.8% 17.0% Consolidated Operating Income Margin 11.7% 10.4% Income from the company’s reportable segments increased 12% to $1.92 billion in 2010 due primarily to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income. Analytical Technologies (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues $ 4,611.8 $ 4,153.9 11% Operating Income Margin 21.3% 20.2% 1.1 Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $458 million to $4.61 billion in 2010. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $21 million in 2010. Sales increased $232 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $247 million (6%) primarily due to increased demand including higher stimulus-funded spending by customers, particularly in the first quarter. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control equipment improved in 2010. Demand was also strong for mass spectrometry instruments, bioscience offerings and clinical diagnostic consumables. Operating income margin was 21.3% in 2010 and 20.2% in 2009. The increase resulted from profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions. Financial Statement Index 42 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations (continued) Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues $ 6,693.0 $ 6,426.6 4% Operating Income Margin 13.9% 13.7% 0.2 Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $266 million to $6.69 billion in 2010. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a nominal decrease in revenues in 2010. Sales increased $34 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $232 million (4%) primarily due to stronger demand and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment, which had been particularly weak in 2009, and consumables improved in 2010. The increase in revenues was offset in part by a $102 million, net reduction in sales due to termination and transition of a supply contract discussed below and, to a lesser extent, lower revenues associated with flu due to milder flu conditions in 2010. In November 2009, a significant supplier of the company’s healthcare market channel notified the company that it intended to cease an existing supply arrangement in mid-2010. The company believes this was in part a response to the company’s strategic decision to expand its product offerings to provide its customers with a broader menu of diagnostic solutions. The company has signed an agreement with an alternative supplier of laboratory products and has begun selling these and other products from the new supplier offsetting a portion of the drop in revenue. As a result of these events, sales were unfavorably affected by $102 million, net, in 2010 compared with 2009. The company expects that cessation of the supply contract will continue to unfavorably affect revenue growth by approximately $55 million in the first half of 2011. Operating income margin increased to 13.9% in 2010 from 13.7% in 2009, primarily due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and lower operating costs following restructuring actions, offset in part by strategic investments including expansion of sales and marketing staff in the Asia/Pacific region and information technology initiatives in Europe. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $100 million and $122 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively (Note 4). Interest expense decreased to $85 million from $118 million in 2009 primarily as a result of lower interest rates on variable rate debt following refinancings completed in late 2009 and the first half of 2010. In 2010 and 2009, other expense, net, includes losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $17 million and $15 million, respectively (Note 9) and in 2010, $8 million of fees associated with short-term financing commitments for the pending Dionex acquisition. Provision for Income Taxes The company’s effective tax rates were 11.3% and 8.2% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by $17.4 million or 1.5 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2011 will be between 15.5% and 17.5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 43 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations (continued) In the third quarter of 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation that the company expects will reduce the amount of foreign tax credits available to the company beginning in 2011. While complete detailed regulations have yet to be issued, the company is studying the possible effect of the legislation and has identified tax planning and mitigating actions it will undertake which are expected to offset the adverse impact on the company’s tax provision of a loss of foreign tax credits. Contingent Liabilities At the end of 2010, the company was contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the matters described under “Litigation and Related Contingencies” in Note 10 could materially affect the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Discontinued Operations During 2010, the company recorded additional proceeds related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after-tax gain of $2.5 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2009, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued new rules pertaining to the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple customer deliverables and for software-enabled products. The new rule pertaining to arrangements under which the company has multiple customer deliverables provides an alternative method for establishing the fair value of a deliverable when vendor specific objective evidence or third-party evidence is not available. The guidance requires the determination of the best estimate of selling price to separate deliverables and allows the allocation of the customer’s consideration using this relative selling price model. The new guidance pertaining to software-enabled products revised the existing software accounting guidance to exclude equipment where the software is more than incidental to the value of the product. Under the new standard, such equipment is accounted for under revenue recognition criteria applicable to tangible products instead of that applicable to software. The company adopted the rules prospectively on January 1, 2010. Adoption did not materially affect the company’s results of operations or financial position. Effective January 1, 2010, the company adopted new accounting guidance pertaining to the consolidation assessment of variable interest entities. The new guidance requires the company to determine whether its variable interests in third party entities give the company a controlling financial interest in the entities. This amended guidance replaces the previous quantitative approach for identifying when enterprises should consolidate variable interest entities with a qualitative analysis, based on which enterprise has both (1) the power to direct the economic activities of a variable interest entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that could be significant to the variable interest entity. Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the company’s results of operations or financial position. Financial Statement Index 44 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations (continued) 2009 Compared With 2008 Continuing Operations Total Currency Acquisitions/ (In millions) 2009 2008 Change Translation Divestitures Operations Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,153.9 $ 4,468.6 $ (314.7 ) $ (92.2 ) $ 43.8 $ (266.3 ) Laboratory Products and Services 6,426.6 6,455.2 (28.6 ) (127.5 ) 121.4 (22.5 ) Eliminations (470.8 ) (425.8 ) (45.0 ) 8.6 (0.5 ) (53.1 ) Consolidated Revenues $ 10,109.7 $ 10,498.0 $ (388.3 ) $ (211.1 ) $ 164.7 $ (341.9 ) Sales in 2009 were $10.11 billion, a decrease of $388 million from 2008. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $211 million in 2009. Sales increased $165 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $342 million (3%) primarily a result of decreased demand which the company believes was due to economic uncertainty offset in part by price increases, as described by segment below. Sales of equipment and, to a lesser extent, services were particularly affected as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global market downturn. Sales of consumables grew modestly, however, and were not as significantly affected by the severe economic conditions. Sales were down in North America and Europe but grew modestly in Asia. In the latter part of 2009, the dollar weakened against other major currencies in which the company sells products and services. Weakening of the dollar had a favorable effect on revenues of the company of approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. In 2009, operating income and operating income margin were $1.05 billion and 10.4%, respectively, compared with $1.23 billion and 11.7%, respectively, in 2008. The decrease in operating income was due to lower profitability at existing businesses resulting from decreased revenues offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. In addition, restructuring and other costs increased $32 million in 2009 due primarily to a pension plan curtailment gain in the 2008 period and, to a lesser extent, increased cost reduction measures in 2009 due to the economic downturn. In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $69 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Biolab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain pre-merger Fisher product liability-related matters. The company incurred $62 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation-related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006 (Note 14). In 2008, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $37 million, including $2 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations. The company incurred $38 million of cash costs primarily for severance to reduce headcount at several businesses in response to economic uncertainty and a decline in financial markets and for abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded a $7 million charge for the impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets associated with a small business unit acquired as part of Fisher, a $5 million loss from a litigation-related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher, a $3 million net loss on the sale of businesses and a $3 million charge for in-process research and development at an acquired business. These charges were offset by a $19 million gain on the curtailment of part of a pension plan in the U.S. Financial Statement Index 45 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations (continued) Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment decreased $315 million to $4.15 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $92 million in 2009. Sales increased $44 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $267 million (6%) primarily due to lower demand offset in part by increased prices. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control instruments was particularly weak, which the company believes was due to the global economic downturn. The decrease in sales of these products was offset in part by higher demand for bioscience offerings and diagnostic products, including flu tests. Operating income margin was 20.2% in 2009 and 21.4% in 2008. The decrease resulted from lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 Change Revenues $ 6,426.6 $ 6,455.2 0% Operating Income Margin 13.7% 14.2% (0.5) Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment decreased $29 million to $6.43 billion in 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $128 million in 2009. Sales increased $121 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $22 million primarily due to a decrease in sales of products purchased from a supplier discussed below, offset in part by increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment was weak as the company believes customers reduced purchases due to the global economic downturn, however, this was more than offset by higher demand for products purchased through the company’s research market and healthcare market channels. In July 2008, the company and a significant supplier of its healthcare market channel extended an existing agreement for two years through 2010. Under the revised agreement, the company’s revenues from the sale of products purchased from the supplier decreased $61 million in 2009 to $205 million. Operating income margin decreased to 13.7% in 2009 from 14.2% in 2008, primarily due to lower profitability from decreased revenues, offset in part by price increases and productivity improvements, including lower operating costs following restructuring actions and global sourcing initiatives. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $122 million and $101 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively (Note 4). Interest income decreased to $16 million in 2009 from $52 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates on invested cash balances. Interest expense decreased to $118 million from $152 million in 2008 primarily as a result of a reduction in average debt and lower interest rates on variable rate debt. In 2009, other expense, net, includes a $15 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 9). Provision for Income Taxes The company’s effective tax rates were 8.2% and 13.5% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The tax provision in 2008 was favorably affected by $28 million or 2.5 percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 47 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations (continued) Discontinued Operations During 2008, the company recorded additional proceeds and the reversal of a reserve on a note receivable related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after-tax gain of $6 million. The note was collected in July 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $2.43 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $2.89 billion at December 31, 2009. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $0.93 billion at December 31, 2010 and $1.57 billion at December 31, 2009. The decreases resulted primarily from cash used for repurchases of company common stock and acquisitions, as discussed below. 2010 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.50 billion during 2010. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $90 million and $28 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Increases in other assets used cash of $81 million primarily due to the timing of value added tax (VAT) refunds and prepaid expenses. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $370 million in 2010, compared with $330 million in 2009 due to an increase in taxable income. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $48 million during 2010. During 2010, the company’s primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $606 million for acquisitions and $266 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. In December 2010, the company entered an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. In February 2011, the company entered separate agreements to sell both its Athena Diagnostics and Lancaster Laboratories businesses for aggregate consideration of $940 million in cash. The transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. The company’s financing activities used $1.30 billion of cash during 2010, principally for the extinguishment of debt and repurchase of $1.01 billion of the company’s common stock, offset in part by the net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $741 million. The company used the net proceeds from the issuance of debt and existing cash balances to convert all of the $326 million principal outstanding on its Floating Rate Convertible Debentures due 2033 for a total cash outlay of $573 million and to redeem all of its $500 million principal outstanding 6 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes at a redemption price of $1,030.63 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $515 million (Note 9). The company’s financing activities also included $77 million of proceeds of employee stock option exercises. On April 19, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of the company’s common stock through April 19, 2011. On September 8, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the company’s common stock through September 8, 2011. At December 31, 2010, $487.5 million was available for future repurchases of the company’s common stock under these authorizations. On February 23, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the company's common stock through February 22, 2012. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment and expects that for all of 2011, such expenditures will approximate $285 to $310 million. As of December 31, 2010, the company’s outstanding debt totaled $2.14 billion, of which approximately $0.33 billion is convertible debt, at a conversion price of $40.20 per share. Upon an investor’s election to convert, the company is required to pay the principal portion of these debentures in cash, and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock, at the company's election. For any holders electing to convert in the next 12 months or electing to put the debt to the company at the first date on which this is permitted (March 2011), the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund any principal payments in excess of $100 million which has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying balance sheet. The facility is an unsecured revolving credit agreement expiring in 2012 with available capacity of $952 million at December 31, 2010. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) In December 2010, the company obtained short-term financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund $1.5 billion of the purchase price of Dionex. However, in February 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion of senior notes with maturities of 3 – 10 years, primarily to fund the purchase of Dionex, and subsequently terminated the short-term financing commitment. If the company does not consummate the Dionex acquisition by September 30, 2011, the company will be required to redeem these notes in whole at a redemption price of 101% of the aggregate principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The company believes that its existing cash and short-term investments of $926 million as of December 31, 2010, and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2009 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.66 billion during 2009. Decreases in accounts receivable and inventory provided cash of $127 million and $108 million, respectively. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $45 million. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted primarily from improved collections and the decrease in inventories resulted primarily from increased fourth quarter shipments in 2009 over the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $51 million during 2009. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $330 million and $292 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009, the company’s primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $637 million for acquisitions and $208 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities used $558 million of cash during 2009, principally for the extinguishment of debt and the repurchase of $415 million of the company’s common stock, offset in part by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $748 million. In December 2009, the company redeemed all of the $300 million principal outstanding on its 6.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 at a redemption price of 103.375% for a total cash outlay of $317 million including accrued interest. Also in December 2009, the company repurchased in a tender offer $282 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.50% convertible Senior Notes due 2023 at $2,072.4743 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $587 million including accrued and unpaid interest (Note 9). The company’s financing activities also included $54 million of proceeds of employee stock option exercises. 2008 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.42 billion during 2008. A decrease in accounts payable used $124 million of cash due to the timing of payments at year-end. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $51 million and $50 million, respectively, representing working capital increases associated with the growth in revenues. Cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $292 million in 2008 compared with $125 million in 2007, primarily as a result of no longer having tax loss carryforwards in the U.S. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $36 million during 2008. Financial Statement Index 49 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) During 2008, the company’s primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $201 million for acquisitions and $264 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities used $228 million of cash during 2008, principally for the repurchase of $187 million of the company’s common stock and repayment of $151 million of debt, offset in part by proceeds of stock option exercises. The company had proceeds of $85 million from the exercise of employee stock options and $25 million of tax benefits from the exercise of stock options. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2008 - 2010 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $3.9 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the company’s own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 50 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the company’s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010. Payments due by Period or Expiration of Commitment (In millions) 2011 2012 and 2013 2014 and 2015 2016 and Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments Debt principal, including short-term debt (a) $ 104.9 $ 355.9 $ 1,110.4 $ 530.9 $ 2,102.1 Interest (b) 48.6 94.5 77.1 148.4 368.6 Capital lease obligations 0.8 0.6 0.1 — 1.5 Operating lease obligations 103.9 144.1 80.9 68.6 397.5 Unconditional purchase obligations (c) 197.9 13.1 — — 211.0 Letters of credit and bank guarantees 68.4 7.7 0.1 20.2 96.4 Surety bonds and other guarantees 36.5 10.2 — — 46.7 Pension obligations on balance sheet 24.0 53.2 59.7 109.6 246.5 Asset retirement obligations 4.0 4.9 2.3 11.4 22.6 Acquisition-related contingent consideration accrued on balance sheet 27.5 1.2 — — 28.7 Other (d) 6.2 — — — 6.2 $ 622.7 $ 685.4 $ 1,330.6 $ 889.1 $ 3,527.8 (a) Amounts represent the expected cash payments for debt and do not include any deferred issuance costs. (b) For the purpose of this calculation, amounts assume interest rates on floating rate obligations remain unchanged from levels at December 31, 2010, throughout the life of the obligation. (c) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (d) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $62 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. In December 2010, the company entered into an agreement to acquire Dionex Corporation for $2.1 billion in cash. Completion of the acquisition is subject to a majority of the outstanding shares of Dionex having been tendered and certain regulatory approvals. Financial Statement Index 51 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2011, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $285 to $310 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business – Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain operational and balance sheet exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates or commodity prices. Such exposures result from purchases, sales and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations or commodity price movement. The company engages in limited hedging activities primarily to protect the company’s cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and from volatility in commodity prices. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Indian rupees, Canadian dollars and Chilean pesos. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2010, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2010 was $2.29 billion. Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2010 would increase by approximately $77 million. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. A 100-basis-point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2010, would increase the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $12 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the company’s reporting currency as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Swedish kronor, and Swiss francs. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2010 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $441 million. Financial Statement Index 52 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2010 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $41 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2010 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $12 million on the company’s net income. Equity Prices The company’s convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the company’s common stock. Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company’s convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument. A 10% increase in year-end 2010 market equity prices would increase the fair value of the company’s convertible obligations by $45 million.",2023-12-30 17:37:32.996914
97745,TMO,THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.,2012,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reference is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report. Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. Beginning in the third quarter of 2011, the company’s continuing operations fall into three business segments (see Note 3): Analytical Technologies, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services. Prior period segment results have been adjusted to conform to this presentation. The results of two businesses sold on April 4, 2011, have been classified and presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements. Prior period results have been adjusted to conform to this presentation. The results discussed below refer to the company’s continuing operations unless otherwise noted. (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 3,845.4 32.8% $ 3,238.2 30.6% Specialty Diagnostics 2,465.8 21.0% 2,149.0 20.3% Laboratory Products and Services 5,935.4 50.6% 5,650.9 53.5% Eliminations (520.7 ) (4.4)% (467.9 ) (4.4)% $ 11,725.9 100% $ 10,570.2 100% Sales in 2011 were $11.73 billion, an increase of $1.16 billion from 2010. The increase was due to acquisitions, including Phadia and Dionex, and, to a lesser extent, higher sales at existing businesses and the favorable effects of currency translation. Had Phadia, Dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of 2010, pro forma revenues would have increased $787 million (7%) over pro forma 2010 revenues. Aside from the effects of currency translation and other acquisitions, net of divestitures, pro forma revenues increased $389 million (3%) over pro forma 2010 revenues (discussed in total and by segment below). The increase in pro forma revenues was primarily due to increased demand, offset in part by lower sales resulting from cessation of a supply contract, discussed below, and lower stimulus-funded sales in Japan as compared to 2010, which together decreased sales by approximately one percentage point. The company had lower sales to academic and government markets in the second half of 2011 which it believes may be due to uncertainty in funding expectations in the U.S. and Europe. These markets represent approximately a quarter of the company’s revenues and the decrease in sales to this customer base reduced the company’s overall growth in the second half of 2011 by approximately one percentage point, although the decline moderated in the fourth quarter. The company currently expects weakness in academic and government markets will continue into 2012. The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2011 and 2010. The company’s principal recent acquisitions are described below. • Phadia, a global leader in the development, manufacturing and marketing of complete blood-test systems to support the clinical diagnosis and monitoring of allergy and autoimmune diseases, was acquired in August 2011 to expand the company’s specialty diagnostics offerings. • Dionex, a global leader in the manufacturing and marketing of ion and liquid chromatography and sample preparation systems, consumables, and software for chemical analysis, was acquired in May 2011 to expand the company’s chromatography systems portfolio. Financial Statement Index 28 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) • Fermentas, a manufacturer and global distributor of enzymes, reagents and kits for molecular and cellular biology research, was acquired in July 2010 to expand the company’s ability to provide complete workflows for genomics research. • Finnzymes, a provider of integrated tools for molecular biology analysis, including reagents, instruments, consumables and kits, was acquired in March 2010 to expand the company’s portfolio of reagents and other consumables for the molecular biology research and diagnostics markets. • Ahura Scientific, a provider of handheld spectroscopy instruments that are used worldwide in the identification of chemicals for safety, security and pharmaceutical applications, was acquired in February 2010 to expand the company’s portfolio of portable analytical devices. In 2011, operating income and operating income margin were $1.25 billion and 10.6%, respectively, compared with $1.21 billion and 11.4%, respectively, in 2010. The decrease in operating income margin was primarily due to $124 million of higher acquisition-related charges and an increase in amortization expense of $93 million in 2011 primarily related to the acquisitions of Phadia and Dionex. The decrease in operating margin was offset in part by productivity improvements and profit on incremental sales from acquisitions and existing businesses. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) processes, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives and a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities. The company’s effective tax rates were 9.5% and 9.8% in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions including the effect of the Phadia acquisition. The tax provision in 2011 was unfavorably affected by $12 million, or 1.0 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, offset in part by $8 million, or 0.7 percentage points, by the ability to use tax loss carryforwards as a result of the Phadia acquisition. The tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by $17 million or 1.6 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2012 will be between 11.5% to 13.5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. Income from continuing operations increased to $1.02 billion in 2011, from $997 million in 2010, primarily due to increased operating income, offset in part by higher other expense, net, primarily interest expense as a result of borrowings to partially fund acquisitions. On April 4, 2011, the company sold, in separate transactions, its Athena Diagnostics business (Athena) for $740 million in cash and its Lancaster Laboratories business (Lancaster) for $180 million in cash and escrowed proceeds of $20 million, due in October 2012. The sale of these businesses resulted in an after-tax gain in discontinued operations of $304 million or $0.79 per diluted share. During 2011, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $1.69 billion (including $13 million from discontinued operations), compared with $1.50 billion (including $45 million from discontinued operations) for 2010. The increase resulted primarily from higher income before amortization and depreciation, offset in part by growth in working capital items in 2011 compared to 2010. As of December 31, 2011, the company’s short-term debt totaled $1.27 billion, principally commercial paper obligations and $354 million of senior notes, due December 2012. Under its principal unsecured revolving credit agreement, expiring in August 2012, the company has available capacity of $951 million at December 31, 2011. In addition, the company has a $1 billion short-term revolving credit agreement expiring in June 2012, the purpose of which is to provide short-term funds in the event access to commercial paper markets is not available. The company expects to renew these facilities before their expiration, for all or a portion of the available borrowings thereunder. At December 31, 2011, the company had $900 million of commercial paper indebtedness outstanding and accordingly, the company had $100 million of borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program revolver. Financial Statement Index 29 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) The company believes that its existing cash and short-term investments of $1.02 billion as of December 31, 2011, and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under both its principal and commercial paper revolving credit agreements and the expected renewals thereof, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, equity investments, sales returns, warranty obligations, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, pension costs and stock-based compensation. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: (a) Accounts Receivable The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such allowances totaled $67 million at December 31, 2011. The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. (b) Inventories The company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required. (c) Intangible Assets and Goodwill The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $6.47 billion at December 31, 2011. The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. Financial Statement Index 30 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $11.99 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2011. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The company’s businesses were adversely affected in 2009 by the global economic downturn, although results progressively improved during the year and in 2010. Growth at some of the company’s businesses also slowed in 2011 which the company believes was in part due to uncertainty in funding expectations of customers in academic and government markets. Projections of profitability for 2012 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2011, the date of the company’s impairment testing. There can be no assurance, however, that the slowing of growth experienced in 2011 at some businesses will not continue or worsen in 2012 and that a downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary. (d) Other Long-lived Assets The company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Other long-lived assets totaled $2.21 billion at December 31, 2011, including $1.66 billion of fixed assets. In testing a long-lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset-related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long-lived assets may be necessary. (e) Revenues In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change, the company’s revenue recognition would be affected. Financial Statement Index 31 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) In instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing. The company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or “elements.” The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements other than post-contract support is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately. The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required. (f) Warranty Obligations At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for warranty obligations of the company’s continuing operations totaled $42 million at December 31, 2011. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary. (g) Income Taxes In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. The company’s reserve for these matters totaled $120 million at December 31, 2011. Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized. The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income. Financial Statement Index 32 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $142 million at December 31, 2011. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the company’s tax provision would result. (h) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Reserves of acquired businesses, including environmental reserves, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. (i) Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Several of the company’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $17 million in 2011. The company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $346 million at year-end 2011 compared with $244 million at year-end 2010. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $79 million. The company expects to contribute between $20 and $30 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2012. Financial Statement Index 33 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) (j) Stock-based Compensation The fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for determining the expected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock-based compensation. The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures. If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required. Results of Operations 2011 Compared With 2010 Continuing Operations Sales in 2011 were $11.73 billion, an increase of $1.16 billion from 2010. The increase was due to acquisitions, including Phadia and Dionex, and, to a lesser extent, higher revenues at existing businesses and the favorable effects of currency translation. Had Phadia, Dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of 2010, pro forma revenues would have increased $787 million (7%) over pro forma 2010 revenues, including $132 million due to other acquisitions, net of divestitures, $266 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation and $389 million (3%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The increase in pro forma revenues at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand, offset in part by lower sales resulting from cessation of a supply contract, discussed below, and lower stimulus-funded sales in Japan as compared to 2010, which together decreased sales by approximately 1 percentage point. Sales growth was strong in Asia and modest in Europe and North America. The results in North America and Asia were affected by the cessation of the supply contract and the lower stimulus-funded sales in Japan, respectively. The company had lower sales to academic and government markets in the second half of 2011 which it believes may be due to uncertainty in funding expectations in the U.S. and Europe. These markets represent approximately a quarter of the company’s revenues and the decrease in sales to this customer base reduced the company’s overall growth in the second half of 2011 by approximately one percentage point, although the decline moderated in the fourth quarter. The company currently expects weakness in academic and government markets will continue into 2012. In 2011, operating income and operating income margin were $1.25 billion and 10.6%, respectively, compared with $1.21 billion and 11.4%, respectively, in 2010. The decrease in operating income margin was primarily due to $124 million of higher acquisition-related charges and an increase in amortization expense of $93 million in 2011 primarily related to the acquisitions of Phadia and Dionex. The decrease in operating margin was offset in part by productivity improvements and profit on incremental sales from acquisitions and existing businesses. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) processes, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives and a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities. In 2011, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $235 million, including $73 million of charges to cost of revenues related primarily to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $62 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for cash transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Phadia and Dionex. The company incurred $85 million of other cash costs, including $21 million of cash compensation from monetizing equity awards held by Dionex employees at the date of acquisition. The cash costs also include continuing costs associated with headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, such as the following: the consolidation of facilities of acquired businesses in Finland and Australia with existing facilities in those countries; the consolidation of facilities in the U.S. and Mexico; and the restructuring of the commercial organization of a business across six European countries to increase productivity and efficiency in serving customers. The company also recorded $15 million of non-cash costs, net, primarily for the impairment of intangible assets at several small business units and, to a lesser extent, a loss on sale of a business (see Note 14). Financial Statement Index 34 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) In 2010, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $79 million, including $16 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $3 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs, net, primarily related to the acquisition of Dionex and revisions of estimated contingent consideration, principally related to the acquisition of Ahura Scientific, offset in part by a gain of $11 million on settlement with product liability insurers. The company incurred $34 million of cash costs, primarily for actions initiated in 2009 and, to a lesser extent, 2010 in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company recorded impairment charges of $17 million for intangible assets associated with several small business units. The company also recorded a $6 million charge on a patent infringement claim initiated prior to a business unit’s acquisition by the company and $3 million of asset writedowns associated with abandoned facilities held for sale. As of February 29, 2012, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $60 million in 2012 and expects to identify additional actions during 2012. The restructuring projects for which actions commenced in 2011 will result in annual cost savings of approximately $85 million beginning in part in 2011 and, to a greater extent, in 2012, including $30 million in the Analytical Technologies segment, $15 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $40 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The additional actions approved in 2011 and commencing in 2012 will result in $30 million of additional annual savings following their completion. The restructuring actions initiated in 2010 resulted in annual cost savings beginning primarily in 2011 of approximately $50 million, including $5 million in the Analytical Technologies segment, $10 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $35 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. On February 3, 2012, the Internal Revenue Service issued proposed regulations that provide guidance on the excise tax imposed on the sale of medical devices under Internal Revenue Code Section 4191. The tax applies to the sale of certain medical devices by a manufacturer, producer or importer of the device. The tax is in the amount of 2.3% of the sale price and will apply to all devices that are sold beginning January 1, 2013. Based on the company’s estimate of product revenue that is expected to be subject to the regulations, the company currently expects that imposition of the tax will cost $20-30 million annually, beginning in 2013. Segment Results The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis. Financial Statement Index 35 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Analytical Technologies (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 Change Revenues $ 3,845.4 $ 3,238.2 19% Operating Income Margin 18.7% 17.0% 1.7 Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $607 million to $3.85 billion in 2011. The increase was due to acquisitions, including Dionex, higher revenue at existing businesses and, to a lesser extent, the favorable effects of currency translation. Had Dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of 2010, pro forma revenues would have increased $349 million (10%) over pro forma 2010 revenues, including increases of $47 million due to other acquisitions, $95 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation and $207 million (6%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The increase in pro forma revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand. Demand was particularly strong for instruments serving industrial and applied markets. The increase in revenues was offset in part by lower stimulus-funded sales in Japan in the first quarter of 2011 which decreased pro forma growth by 1 percentage point. Financial Statement Index 36 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Operating income margin was 18.7% in 2011 and 17.0% in 2010. The increase resulted from productivity improvements and, to a lesser extent, accretive acquisitions, price increases and profit on incremental sales at existing businesses. These increases were offset in part by higher spending on research and development initiatives. Specialty Diagnostics (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 Change Revenues $ 2,465.8 $ 2,149.0 15% Operating Income Margin 24.2% 22.7% 1.5 Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $317 million to $2.47 billion in 2011. The increase was due to acquisitions, including Phadia, higher revenue at existing businesses and the favorable effects of currency translation. Had Phadia and the company been combined from the beginning of 2010, pro forma revenues would have increased $206 million (8%) over pro forma 2010 revenues, including increases of $19 million due to other acquisitions, $68 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation and $120 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The increase in pro forma revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand. Demand was particularly strong for immunodiagnostics and clinical diagnostics products. The increase in demand was offset in part by cessation of a supply contract, discussed below, which decreased pro forma growth by 2 percentage points. In November 2009, a significant supplier of the company’s healthcare market channel notified the company that it intended to cease an existing supply arrangement in mid-2010. The company believes this was in part a response to the company’s strategic decision to expand its product offerings to provide its customers with a broader menu of diagnostic solutions. The company signed an agreement with an alternative supplier of laboratory products and is selling these and other products from the new supplier, offsetting a portion of the drop in revenue. As a result of these events, sales were unfavorably affected by $54 million, net, in the first half of 2011. Operating income margin was 24.2% in 2011 and 22.7% in 2010. The increase resulted from productivity improvements and, to a lesser extent, profit on incremental sales at existing businesses and accretive acquisitions. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 Change Revenues $ 5,935.4 $ 5,650.9 5% Operating Income Margin 13.7% 14.2% (0.5 ) Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $285 million to $5.94 billion in 2011. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $107 million in 2011. Sales increased $66 million due to acquisitions. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $112 million (2%) primarily due to increased demand. Demand for biopharma outsourcing services was particularly strong. Operating income margin decreased to 13.7% in 2011 from 14.2% in 2010, primarily due to inflationary pressures on costs, particularly oil-based raw materials such as plastic resin, and, to a lesser extent, commercial investments including expansion of sales and marketing staff in the Asia/Pacific region and information technology initiatives in Europe. These decreases were offset in part by productivity improvements. Financial Statement Index 37 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $119 million and $100 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively (Note 4). The increase was primarily due to a $91 million increase in interest expense, offset in part by higher other items, net and higher interest income. The increase in interest expense was related to the debt issued to fund the Phadia and Dionex acquisitions, offset in part by having refinanced higher-rate debt during 2010. In 2011, other items, net includes a $28 million gain on currency exchange contracts associated with the Phadia acquisition and repayment of its multi-currency debt and an $18 million gain on the sale of an investment accounted for under the cost method, offset in part by $10 million of fees associated with short-term financing commitments to fund the Phadia acquisition. In 2010, other items, net includes a $17 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt and $8 million of fees associated with short-term financing commitments for the Dionex acquisition. Provision for Income Taxes The company’s effective tax rates were 9.5% and 9.8% in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions including the effect of the Phadia acquisition. The tax provision in 2011 was unfavorably affected by $12 million, or 1.0 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, offset in part by $8 million, or 0.7 percentage points, by the ability to use tax loss carryforwards as a result of the Phadia acquisition. The tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by $17 million or 1.6 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2012 will be between 11.5% to 13.5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. Discontinued Operations On April 4, 2011, the company sold, in separate transactions, its Athena Diagnostics business (Athena) for $740 million in cash and its Lancaster Laboratories business (Lancaster) for $180 million in cash and escrowed proceeds of $20 million, due in October 2012. The sale of these businesses resulted in an after-tax gain of $304 million or $0.79 per diluted share. Revenues and operating income of the two businesses aggregated approximately $225 million and $60 million, respectively, in 2010. Athena provides diagnostic testing for neurological and other diseases, with an emphasis on gene-based tests. Lancaster is a contract-testing laboratory that provides analytical laboratory services. The results of both businesses have been included in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented (Note 2). After-tax income from discontinued operations was $5.5 million and $36.1 million, in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The company also received additional proceeds from a previously divested business in the second quarter of 2011, resulting in an after-tax gain of $1 million. During the first quarter of 2010, the company recorded additional proceeds related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after-tax gain of $2.5 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2011, the FASB issued new guidance which requires enhanced disclosures on offsetting amounts within the balance sheet, including disclosing gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset or subject to a master netting or similar agreement. The guidance is effective for the company beginning January 1, 2013 and is to be applied retrospectively. The adoption of this guidance, which is related to disclosure only, will not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2011, the FASB issued revised guidance requiring entities to provide additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures about an employer’s participation and financial obligations in a multiemployer pension plan. The new rule is intended to increase transparency about an employer’s participation in a multiemployer pension plan. The new guidance was effective in 2011. Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the company’s results of operations or financial position. Financial Statement Index 38 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) In September 2011, the FASB modified existing rules to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment. The revised guidance permits an entity to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If impairment is deemed more likely than not, management would perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. This guidance will be effective for the company on January 1, 2012. Adoption of this standard will not have an impact on the company’s results of operations or financial position. In June 2011, the FASB issued new guidance pertaining to the presentation of comprehensive income. The new rule eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. The standard is intended to provide a more consistent method of presenting non-owner transactions that affect the company’s equity. Under the new guidance, an entity can elect to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements. The new guidance will be effective for the company on January 1, 2012 and will not have an impact on the company’s results of operations or financial position. In May 2011, the FASB amended existing rules covering fair value measurement and disclosure to clarify guidance and minimize differences between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The new guidance requires entities to provide information about valuation techniques and unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements and provide a narrative description of the sensitivity of Level 3 measurements to changes in unobservable inputs. The guidance will be effective for the company on January 1, 2012 and is not expected to have a material impact on its financial statements. Contingent Liabilities The company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome in one or more of the matters described under “Litigation and Related Contingencies” in Note 10 could materially affect the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. 2010 Compared With 2009 Continuing Operations Sales in 2010 were $10.57 billion, an increase of $659 million from 2009. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $19 million in 2010. Sales increased $267 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $411 million (4%) due to increased demand and, to a lesser extent, higher stimulus-funded spending by customers and price increases. Sales rebounded from a weak 2009 when the company believes a global economic slowdown reduced demand. Sales growth was strong in Asia, moderate in North America and modest in Europe in 2010. The increase in revenues was offset in part by cessation of a supply contract and a milder flu season in 2010 which together unfavorably affected revenue growth by 2 percentage points in 2010. The company estimates that stimulus-funded spending increased revenues by approximately 1 percentage point in 2010, primarily in the first quarter. In 2010, operating income and operating income margin were $1.21 billion and 11.4%, respectively, compared with $1.00 billion and 10.1%, respectively, in 2009. The increases in operating income and operating income margin were due to profit on incremental sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements. In addition, amortization expense decreased by $25 million in 2010, primarily due to the completion of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles from a 2005 acquisition. Financial Statement Index 39 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) In 2010, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $79 million, including: $16 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $3 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs, net, primarily related to the acquisition of Dionex and revisions of estimated contingent consideration, principally related to the acquisition of Ahura Scientific, offset in part by a gain of $11 million on settlement with product liability insurers. The company incurred $34 million of cash costs, primarily for actions initiated in 2009 and, to a lesser extent, 2010 in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company recorded impairment charges of $17 million for intangible assets associated with several small business units. The company also recorded a $6 million charge on a patent infringement claim initiated prior to a business unit’s acquisition by the company and $3 million of asset writedowns associated with abandoned facilities held for sale. In 2009, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $67 million, including $7 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Biolab and B.R.A.H.M.S. offset in part by a gain primarily for settlement of certain product liability-related matters. The company incurred $60 million of cash costs, primarily for actions in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also incurred a $2 million loss on an abandoned facility held for sale that was sold in July 2009 and a $3 million charge for pension termination benefits, offset by a $7 million gain on the settlement of a litigation-related matter assumed as part of the merger with Fisher in 2006. The restructuring actions initiated in 2009 resulted in annual cost savings beginning in the second half of 2009 and early 2010 of approximately $60 million, including $30 million in the Analytical Technologies segment, $10 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $20 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.

The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $15 million in 2010. Sales increased $123 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $211 million (7%) primarily due to increased demand including higher stimulus-funded spending by customers, particularly in the first quarter. Demand in industrial markets for environmental and process control equipment improved in 2010. Demand was also strong for mass spectrometry instruments and bioscience offerings. Operating income margin was 17.0% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009. The increase resulted from productivity improvements and, to a lesser extent, profit on incremental sales.

The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenue of $7 million in 2010. Sales increased $110 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues decreased $104 million (5%) primarily due to a $102 million, net reduction in sales due to termination and transition of a supply contract discussed above. In addition, the segment’s revenues decreased due to milder flu conditions in 2010 than 2009, offset in part by increased demand for clinical diagnostic products. Operating income margin was 22.7% in 2010 and 21.3% in 2009. The increase resulted from productivity improvements and to a lesser extent, sales of higher margin products. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenues $ 5,650.9 $ 5,244.5 8% Operating Income Margin 14.2% 14.0% 0.2 Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $406 million to $5.65 billion in 2010.

In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues increased $371 million (7%) primarily due to stronger demand and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. Demand for laboratory equipment, which had been particularly weak in 2009, and consumables improved in 2010. Operating income margin increased to 14.2% in 2010 from 14.0% in 2009, primarily due to productivity improvements offset in part by inflationary pressures on supply costs and, to a lesser extent, strategic investments including expansion of sales and marketing staff in the Asia/Pacific region and information technology initiatives in Europe. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $100 million and $122 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively Interest expense decreased to $85 million from $118 million in 2009 primarily as a result of lower interest rates on variable rate debt following refinancings completed in late 2009 and the first half of 2010. In 2010 and 2009, other expense, net, includes losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $17 million and $15 million, respectively and in 2010, $8 million of fees associated with short-term financing commitments for the Dionex acquisition. Provision for Income Taxes The company’s effective tax rates were 9.8% and 6.5% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by $17 million or 1.6 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. The tax provision in 2009 was favorably affected by $5.5 million or 0.6 percentage points resulting from the reversal of a tax reserve established at acquisition and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. Financial Statement Index 42 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Discontinued Operations As described above and in Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements, the company sold two businesses on April 4, 2011. The results of both businesses have been included in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented. After-tax income from discontinued operations was $36.1 million and $28.1 million, in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in income was primarily due to incremental profit on higher revenues of the discontinued businesses. During 2010, the company recorded additional proceeds related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after-tax gain of $2.5 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $1.71 billion at December 31, 2011, compared with $2.43 billion at December 31, 2010. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.02 billion at December 31, 2011 and $0.93 billion at December 31, 2010. The decrease in working capital is primarily due to short-term borrowings under the company’s U.S. commercial paper program, used to partially fund the acquisition of Phadia (Note 9), offset in part by increases in accounts receivable and inventories resulting from the acquisitions of Phadia and Dionex. 2011 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.69 billion during 2011. Increases in accounts receivable and inventory used cash of $107 million and $33 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. An increase in other assets used cash of $124 million primarily due to the timing of tax refunds. An increase in accounts payable provided cash of $31 million, primarily due to higher inventory purchases. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $72 million during 2011. During 2011, the company’s primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $5.70 billion for acquisitions and $267 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company’s continuing operations had cash proceeds from a divestiture of $14 million and the company’s discontinued operations had net cash proceeds of $760 million, primarily from the sale of Athena and Lancaster. The company’s financing activities provided $3.55 billion of cash during 2011, principally $5.15 billion from the issuance of debt to fund acquisitions, offset in part by the repurchase of $1.34 billion of the company’s common stock. Following issuance of a redemption notice for the remaining $329 million principal outstanding of the company’s 3.25% Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2024, all of the balance was converted or redeemed for a total cash outlay of $452 million. The company’s financing activities also included $158 million of proceeds of employee stock option exercises. On September 8, 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of the company’s common stock through September 8, 2011. On February 23, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the company’s common stock through February 22, 2012. On November 10, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of the company’s common stock through November 9, 2012. At December 31, 2011, $650 million was available for future repurchases of the company’s common stock under these authorizations. Financial Statement Index 43 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) As of December 31, 2011, the company’s short-term debt totaled $1.27 billion, principally commercial paper obligations and $354 million of senior notes, due December 2012. Under its principal unsecured revolving credit agreement, expiring in August 2012, the company has available capacity of $951 million at December 31, 2011. In addition, the company has a $1 billion short-term revolving credit agreement expiring in June 2012, the purpose of which is to provide short-term funds in the event access to commercial paper markets is not available. The company expects to renew these facilities before their expiration, for all or a portion of the available borrowings thereunder. At December 31, 2011, the company had $900 million of commercial paper indebtedness outstanding and accordingly, the company had $100 million of borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program revolver. The company believes that its existing cash and short-term investments of $1.02 billion as of December 31, 2011, and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under both its principal and commercial paper revolving credit agreements and the expected renewals thereof, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2010 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.50 billion during 2010. Increases in accounts receivable and inventory used cash of $80 million and $28 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Increases in other assets used cash of $81 million, primarily due to the timing of value added tax (VAT) refunds and prepaid expenses. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $370 million in 2010, compared with $330 million in 2009 due to an increase in taxable income. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $47 million during 2010. During 2010, the company’s primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $606 million for acquisitions and $258 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities used $1.30 billion of cash during 2010, principally for the extinguishment of debt and repurchase of $1.01 billion of the company’s common stock, offset in part by the net proceeds for the issuance of long-term debt of $741 million. The company used the net proceeds from the issuance of debt and existing cash balances to convert all of the $326 million principal outstanding on its Floating Rate Convertible Debentures due 2033 for a total cash outlay of $573 million and to redeem all of its $500 million outstanding 6 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes at a redemption price of $1,030.63 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $515 million. The company’s financing activities in 2010 also included $77 million of proceeds of employee stock option exercises. 2009 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.66 billion during 2009. Decreases in accounts receivable and inventory provided cash of $125 million and $108 million, respectively. A decrease in accounts payable used cash of $45 million. The decrease in accounts receivable resulted primarily from improved collections and the decrease in inventories resulted primarily from increased fourth quarter shipments in 2009 over the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $51 million during 2009. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $330 million in 2009. During 2009, the company’s primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $637 million for acquisitions and $200 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. Financial Statement Index 44 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company’s financing activities used $558 million of cash during 2009, principally for the extinguishment of debt and the repurchase of $415 million of the company’s common stock, offset in part by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $748 million. In December 2009, the company redeemed all of the $300 million principal outstanding on its 6.75% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 at a redemption price of 103.375% for a total cash outlay of $317 million including accrued interest. Also in December 2009, the company repurchased in a tender offer $282 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.50% convertible Senior Notes due 2023 at $2,072.4743 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $587 million including accrued and unpaid interest. The company’s financing activities also included $54 million of proceeds of employee stock option exercises. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2009 - 2011 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $3.7 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the company’s own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the company’s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011.

(b) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (c) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. Financial Statement Index 45 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $120 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2012, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $300 to $325 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and related legal fees. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business – Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Australian dollars and Japanese yen. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2011, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised of a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2011 was $7.39 billion (see Note 12). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2011 would increase by approximately $342 million. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2011 would decrease by approximately $321 million. Financial Statement Index 46 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euro, Swedish krona, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Danish krone, and Swiss francs. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2011 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $761 million. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2011 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $30 million. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2011 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $30 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2011 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $10 million on the company’s net income.",2023-12-30 17:37:44.000949
97745,TMO,THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.,2013,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reference is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report. Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s continuing operations fall into three business segments (see Note 3): Analytical Technologies, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services. The results of two businesses sold in April 2011 and a business sold in October 2012, have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements. Prior period results have been adjusted to conform to this presentation. The results discussed below refer to the company’s continuing operations unless otherwise noted. (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,123.7 33.0 % $ 3,845.4 33.3 % Specialty Diagnostics 2,962.3 23.7 % 2,469.9 21.4 % Laboratory Products and Services 5,990.0 47.9 % 5,762.9 49.9 % Eliminations (566.1 ) (4.6 )% (519.4 ) (4.6 )% $ 12,509.9 100 % $ 11,558.8 100 % Sales in 2012 were $12.51 billion, an increase of $951 million from 2011. The increase was due to acquisitions, including Phadia and Dionex, and higher sales at existing businesses, offset in part by the unfavorable effects of currency translation. Had Phadia, Dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of 2011, revenues would have increased $403 million (3%) over pro forma 2011 revenues. Aside from the effects of currency translation and other acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues in 2012 increased $474 million (4%) over pro forma 2011 revenues (discussed in total and by segment below). The pro forma increase in revenues was primarily due to increased demand. Demand from customers in academic and government markets slowed such that growth was nominal in 2012 and demand from customers in industrial markets slowed such that growth was nominal in the second half of 2012. The company expects weakness in academic and government markets will continue in the near term due in part to uncertainty in government funding expectations in the U.S. and Europe. The company expects slowness in industrial markets will continue in the near term due to global economic uncertainty. The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2012 and 2011. The company’s principal recent acquisitions are described below. · One Lambda, a provider of transplant diagnostics, was acquired in September 2012 to enhance the company’s presence in specialty in vitro diagnostics and add new capabilities to the company’s transplant-testing workflow. · Doe & Ingalls, a channel for specialty production chemicals and provider of customized supply-chain services to life sciences and microelectronics industries, was acquired in May 2012 to expand the company’s products and services that address the production market. · Phadia, a global leader in the development, manufacturing and marketing of complete blood-test systems to support the clinical diagnosis and monitoring of allergy and autoimmune diseases, was acquired in August 2011 to expand the company’s specialty diagnostics offerings. Financial Statement Index 28 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) · Dionex, a global leader in the manufacturing and marketing of ion and liquid chromatography and sample preparation systems, consumables, and software for chemical analysis, was acquired in May 2011 to expand the company’s chromatography systems portfolio. In 2012, total company operating income and operating income margin were $1.48 billion and 11.8%, respectively, compared with $1.25 billion and 10.8%, respectively, in 2011. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on incremental sales from acquisitions and existing businesses and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and $84 million of lower acquisition-related charges in 2012. The increase was offset in part by commercial investments and an increase in amortization expense of $100 million in 2012, primarily related to the acquisitions of Phadia and Dionex. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) processes, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives and a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities. The company’s effective tax rates were 0.9% and 9.7% in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization, the company’s cash payments for income taxes for its continuing operations were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $331 million and $353 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due in part to increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions including the effect of the Phadia acquisition. The tax provision in 2012 was favorably affected by $53 million, or 4.1 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, particularly a lower tax rate in Sweden. The tax provision in 2011 was unfavorably affected by $12 million, or 1.0 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, offset in part by $8 million, or 0.7 percentage points, by the ability to use tax loss carryforwards as a result of the Phadia acquisition. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2013 will be between 5% and 7% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax provision in 2013 will benefit from an estimated $13 million of U.S. tax credits for research and development activities in both 2012 and 2013 as a result of legislation enacted in January 2013. Income from continuing operations increased to $1.26 billion in 2012, from $1.02 billion in 2011, primarily due to increased operating income and lower income taxes, offset in part by higher interest expense associated with debt to fund acquisitions. During 2012, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $2.04 billion (after deducting $28 million used by discontinued operations), compared with $1.69 billion (including $14 million from discontinued operations) for 2011. The increase resulted primarily from higher income before amortization and depreciation in 2012 compared to 2011. As of December 31, 2012, the company’s short-term debt totaled $93 million, including $50 million of commercial paper obligations. The company has revolving credit facilities with a bank group that provide up to $2.0 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The credit facilities include a $1 billion 5-year credit agreement, with the ability to request an additional $500 million, plus a $500 million 364-day credit agreement. If the company borrows under these facilities, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2012, no borrowings were outstanding under either facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $50 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. The company believes that its existing cash and short-term investments of $855 million as of December 31, 2012, and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreements are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Financial Statement Index 29 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, equity investments, sales returns, warranty obligations, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, pension costs and stock-based compensation. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: (a) Accounts Receivable The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such allowances totaled $56 million at December 31, 2012. The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. (b) Inventories The company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required. (c) Intangible Assets and Goodwill The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $6.46 billion at December 31, 2012. The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. Financial Statement Index 30 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $12.47 billion and $1.34 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2012. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. Growth at some of the company’s businesses slowed in 2011 and 2012 which the company believes was in part due to uncertainty in funding expectations of customers in academic and government markets and economic uncertainty including a slow-down in Southern Europe. Projections of profitability for 2013 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2012, the date of the company’s impairment testing. There can be no assurance, however, that the slowing of growth experienced in 2011 and 2012 at some businesses will not continue or worsen in 2013 and that a downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary. The company’s ImmunoDiagnostics reporting unit was created with the acquisition of the Phadia Group in August 2011. Because this reporting unit consists solely of the acquired business, its book value equaled its fair value as of the acquisition date and thus, no cushion of fair value over book value existed at that date. During its 2012 goodwill impairment testing, the company determined that the ImmunoDiagnostics reporting unit’s cushion of fair value over book value had increased from 0% at the acquisition date to 9% as of November 2, 2012. Despite this favorable increase, given that the fair value is not substantially in excess of the book value, relatively small decreases in future cash flows from forecasted results or changes in discount rates or other assumptions could result in impairment of goodwill. The key variables that drive the cash flows of the reporting unit are levels of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) rate applied. The estimates used for these assumptions represent management's best estimates, which the company believes are reasonable. These assumptions, however, are subject to uncertainty, including the degree to which the acquired business will grow revenue and profitability levels. The ImmunoDiagnostics reporting unit had $1.78 billion of goodwill, and had an overall carrying value of $3.30 billion as of December 31, 2012. (d) Other Long-lived Assets The company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Other long-lived assets totaled $2.33 billion at December 31, 2012, including $1.73 billion of fixed assets. In testing a long-lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset-related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long-lived assets may be necessary. Financial Statement Index 31 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) (e) Revenues In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change, the company’s revenue recognition would be affected. In instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing. The company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or “elements.” The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements other than post-contract support is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately. The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required. (f) Warranty Obligations At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of standard product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for warranty obligations of the company’s continuing operations totaled $49 million at December 31, 2012. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary. (g) Income Taxes In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. The company’s reserve for these matters totaled $165 million at December 31, 2012. Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes. Financial Statement Index 32 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income. The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $114 million at December 31, 2012. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the company’s tax provision would result. (h) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Reserves of acquired businesses, including product liability and environmental reserves, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. (i) Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Several of the company’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $17 million in 2012. The company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $408 million at year-end 2012 compared with $346 million at year-end 2011. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $11 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $77 million. The company expects to contribute between $60 and $70 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2013. Financial Statement Index 33 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) (j) Stock-based Compensation The fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for determining the expected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The dividend yield is based on the company’s most recent quarterly dividend rate. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock-based compensation. The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures. If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required. Results of Operations 2012 Compared With 2011 Continuing Operations Sales in 2012 were $12.51 billion, an increase of $951 million from 2011. The increase was due to acquisitions, including Phadia and Dionex, and, higher sales at existing businesses, offset in part by the unfavorable effects of currency translation. Had Phadia, Dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of 2011, revenues would have increased $403 million (3%) over pro forma 2011 revenues, including $474 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $156 million due to other acquisitions, net of divestitures, offset in part by $227 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The pro forma increase in revenues was primarily due to increased demand. Sales growth was strong in Asia and moderate in North America and Europe. Demand from customers in academic and government markets slowed such that growth was nominal in 2012 and demand from customers in industrial markets slowed such that growth was nominal in the second half of 2012. The company expects weakness in academic and government markets will continue in the near term due in part to uncertainty in government funding expectations in the U.S. and Europe. The company expects slowness in industrial markets will continue in the near term due to global economic uncertainty. In 2012, total company operating income and operating income margin were $1.48 billion and 11.8%, respectively, compared with $1.25 billion and 10.8%, respectively, in 2011. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on incremental sales from acquisitions and existing businesses and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and $84 million of lower acquisition-related charges in 2012. The increase was offset in part by commercial investments and an increase in amortization expense of $100 million in 2012, primarily related to the acquisitions of Phadia and Dionex. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) processes, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives and a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities. In 2012, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $150 million, including $56 million of charges to cost of revenues related primarily to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and $13 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses consisting primarily of transaction costs related to the acquisition of One Lambda. The company incurred $67 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, such as the consolidation of several facilities in the U.S. and Europe (see Note 14). The company also recorded $15 million of non-cash expense, net, primarily for the impairment of intangible assets at several small business units and, to a lesser extent, real estate writedowns related to facility consolidations partially offset by a $6 million gain from the settlement of pre-acquisition litigation. Financial Statement Index 34 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) In 2011, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $231 million, including $73 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and $62 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Dionex and Phadia. The company incurred $81 million of cash restructuring costs, including $21 million of cash compensation from monetizing equity awards held by Dionex employees at the date of acquisition. The cash costs also include continuing costs associated with headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded $15 million of non-cash expense, net, primarily for the impairment of intangible assets at several small business units and, to a lesser extent, a loss on sale of a heating equipment business. As of February 27, 2013, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $80 million in 2013 and expects to identify additional actions during 2013. The restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2012 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $85 million beginning in part in 2012 and, to a greater extent, in 2013, including $40 million in the Analytical Technologies segment, $20 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $25 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2011 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $80 million beginning in part in 2011 and to a greater extent in 2012, including $30 million in the Analytical Technologies segment, $15 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $35 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. On February 3, 2012, the Internal Revenue Service issued proposed regulations that provide guidance on the excise tax imposed on the sale of medical devices under Internal Revenue Code Section 4191. The tax applies to the sale in the U.S. of certain medical devices by a manufacturer, producer or importer of the device. The tax is in the amount of 2.3% of the sale price and will apply to all devices that are sold beginning January 1, 2013. Based on the company’s estimate of product revenue that is expected to be subject to the regulations, the company currently expects that imposition of the tax will result in an increase in cost of product revenues of approximately $20 to $25 million annually, beginning in 2013. Segment Results The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis. Financial Statement Index 35 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Had Dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of 2011, revenues would have increased $104 million (3%) over pro forma 2011 revenues, including an increase of $184 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $2 million due to acquisitions, net of a disposition, offset in part by $82 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The pro forma increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand across the segment’s range of analytical instruments and for bioscience products, offset in part by lower sales to customers in academic and government markets. Financial Statement Index 36 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Operating income margin was 18.7% in both 2012 and 2011. Profit on incremental sales at existing businesses and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases were substantially offset by higher spending on commercial initiatives and unfavorable currency translation. Specialty Diagnostics (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Change Revenues $ 2,962.3 $ 2,469.9 20 % Operating Income Margin 25.7 % 24.2 % 1.5 Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $492 million to $2.96 billion in 2012. The increase was due to acquisitions, including Phadia, and higher revenue at existing businesses, offset in part by the unfavorable effects of currency translation. Had Phadia and the company been combined from the beginning of 2011, revenues would have increased $118 million (4%) over pro forma 2011 revenues, including increases of $103 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $80 million due to other acquisitions, offset in part by $65 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The pro forma increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for clinical diagnostic products and, to a lesser extent, microbiology products. Operating income margin was 25.7% in 2012 and 24.2% in 2011. The increase resulted primarily from the accretive Phadia acquisition and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and profit on incremental sales at existing businesses. The increases were offset in part by higher spending on commercial initiatives. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Change Revenues $ 5,990.0 $ 5,762.9 4 % Operating Income Margin 14.1 % 14.1 % — Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $227 million to $5.99 billion in 2012. Sales increased $74 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $88 million in 2012. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $242 million (4%) primarily due to increased demand for laboratory consumables and, to a lesser extent, clinical trial logistics services. The increase in demand was offset in part by lower sales of laboratory equipment, particularly to customers in academic and government markets. Operating income margin was 14.1% in both 2012 and 2011. The unfavorable effects of lower sales of higher margin laboratory equipment and higher spending on commercial initiatives were offset by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $213 million and $118 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively (Note 4). The increase was primarily due to an increase of $66 million in interest expense related to the debt issued to fund the Phadia and Dionex acquisitions. In 2011, other items, net included a $28 million gain on currency exchange contracts associated with the Phadia acquisition and repayment of its multi-currency debt and an $18 million gain on the sale of an investment accounted for under the cost method, offset in part by $10 million of fees associated with short-term financing commitments to fund the Phadia acquisition. Financial Statement Index 37 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Provision for Income Taxes The company’s effective tax rates were 0.9% and 9.7% in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization, the company’s cash payments for income taxes for its continuing operations were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $331 million and $353 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due in part to increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions including the effect of the Phadia acquisition. The tax provision in 2012 was favorably affected by $53 million, or 4.1 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, particularly a lower tax rate in Sweden. The tax provision in 2011 was unfavorably affected by $12 million, or 1.0 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, offset in part by $8 million, or 0.7 percentage points, by the ability to use tax loss carryforwards as a result of the Phadia acquisition. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2013 will be between 5% and 7% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax provision in 2013 will benefit from an estimated $13 million of U.S. tax credits for research and development activities in both 2012 and 2013 as a result of legislation enacted in January 2013. Discontinued Operations On June 22, 2012, in an effort to exit a non-core business, the company’s senior management made a decision to pursue a sale of its laboratory workstations business, part of the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The company completed the sale in October 2012 for nominal proceeds. The results of the laboratory workstations business have been classified and presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements. Prior period results have been adjusted to conform to this presentation. Revenues of the laboratory workstations business were $147 million in the 2012 period prior to the sale, compared to $180 million in 2011. The business incurred a pre-tax loss of $30 million in 2012 compared with a pre-tax loss of $6 million in 2011 due to inventory write-offs, higher manufacturing costs and restructuring and other transition costs associated with relocation of the business. In 2012, the company recorded after-tax charges aggregating $63 million as the loss on the divestiture. (Note 15). In addition, the company recorded an after-tax gain of $2 million in 2012 for additional proceeds from a prior divestiture. On April 4, 2011, the company sold, in separate transactions, its Athena Diagnostics business (Athena) for $740 million in cash and its Lancaster Laboratories business (Lancaster) for $180 million in cash and escrowed proceeds of $20 million, substantially all of which was received in October 2012. The sale of these businesses resulted in an after-tax gain of $304 million or $0.79 per diluted share. Revenues and operating income of the two businesses aggregated approximately $225 million and $60 million, respectively, in 2010. The results of both businesses have been included in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The company also received additional proceeds from a previously divested business in 2011, resulting in an after-tax gain of $1 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2013, the FASB issued new guidance which requires disclosure of information about significant reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in a single note or on the face of the financial statements. This guidance will be effective for the company in 2013. Adoption of this standard, which is related to disclosure only, will not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Financial Statement Index 38 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) In July 2012, the FASB modified existing rules to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment. The revised standard allows an entity the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. An entity is not required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. This guidance will be effective for the company in 2013. Adoption of this standard will not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2011, the FASB issued new guidance which requires enhanced disclosures on offsetting amounts within the balance sheet, including disclosing gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset or subject to a master netting or similar agreement. The guidance is effective for the company beginning January 1, 2013 and is to be applied retrospectively. The adoption of this guidance, which is related to disclosure only, will not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2011, the FASB modified existing rules to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment. The revised guidance permits an entity to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If impairment is deemed more likely than not, management would perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. This guidance was effective for the company on January 1, 2012. Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2011, the FASB issued new guidance pertaining to the presentation of comprehensive income. The new rule eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. The standard is intended to provide a more consistent method of presenting non-owner transactions that affect the company’s equity. Under the new guidance, an entity can present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements. The new guidance was effective for the company on January 1, 2012 and did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2011, the FASB amended existing rules covering fair value measurement and disclosure to clarify guidance and minimize differences between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The new guidance requires entities to provide information about valuation techniques and unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements and provide a narrative description of the sensitivity of Level 3 measurements to changes in unobservable inputs. The guidance was effective for the company on January 1, 2012 and did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Contingent Liabilities The company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. In view of the company’s financial condition and the accruals established for these matters, management does not believe that the ultimate liability, if any, related to these matters will have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, an outcome that differs materially from current reserve estimates for one or more of the matters described in Note 10 could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. Financial Statement Index 39 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) 2011 Compared With 2010 Continuing Operations Sales in 2011 were $11.56 billion, an increase of $1.17 billion from 2010. The increase was due to acquisitions, including Phadia and Dionex, and, to a lesser extent, higher revenues at existing businesses and the favorable effects of currency translation. Had Phadia, Dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of 2010, pro forma revenues would have increased $797 million (7%) over pro forma 2010 revenues, including $125 million due to other acquisitions, net of divestitures, $266 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation and $406 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The increase in pro forma revenues at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand, offset in part by lower sales resulting from cessation of a supply contract, discussed below, and lower stimulus-funded sales in Japan as compared to 2010, which together decreased sales by approximately 1 percentage point. Sales growth was strong in Asia and modest in Europe and North America. The results in North America and Asia were affected by the cessation of the supply contract and the lower stimulus-funded sales in Japan, respectively. The company had lower sales to academic and government markets in the second half of 2011 which it believes may be due to uncertainty in funding expectations in the U.S. and Europe. These markets represent approximately a quarter of the company’s revenues and the decrease in sales to this customer base reduced the company’s overall growth in the second half of 2011 by approximately 1 percentage point, although the decline moderated in the fourth quarter. In 2011, operating income and operating income margin were $1.25 billion and 10.8%, respectively, compared with $1.19 billion and 11.4%, respectively, in 2010. The decrease in operating income margin was primarily due to $124 million of higher acquisition-related charges and an increase in amortization expense of $93 million in 2011 primarily related to the acquisitions of Phadia and Dionex. The decrease in operating margin was offset in part by productivity improvements and profit on incremental sales from acquisitions and existing businesses. In 2011, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $231 million, including $73 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and $62 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Dionex and Phadia. The company incurred $81 million of cash restructuring costs, including $21 million of cash compensation from monetizing equity awards held by Dionex employees at the date of acquisition. The cash costs also include continuing costs associated with headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, such as the following: the consolidation of facilities of acquired businesses in Finland and Australia with existing facilities in those countries; the consolidation of facilities in the U.S.; and the restructuring of the commercial organization of a business across six European countries to increase productivity and efficiency in serving customers. The company also recorded $15 million of non-cash expense, net, primarily for the impairment of intangible assets at several small business units and, to a lesser extent, a loss on sale of a heating equipment business. In 2010, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $76 million, including $13 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $3 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs, net, primarily related to the acquisition of Dionex and revisions of estimated contingent consideration, principally related to the acquisition of Ahura Scientific, offset in part by a gain of $11 million on settlement with product liability insurers. The company incurred $33 million of cash costs, primarily for actions initiated in 2009 and, to a lesser extent, 2010 in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company recorded impairment charges of $17 million for intangible assets associated with several small business units. The company also recorded a $6 million charge on a patent infringement claim initiated prior to a business unit’s acquisition by the company and $3 million of asset writedowns associated with abandoned facilities held for sale. Financial Statement Index 40 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2010 resulted in annual cost savings beginning primarily in 2011 of approximately $45 million, including $5 million in the Analytical Technologies segment, $10 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $30 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.

Analytical Technologies (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 Change Revenues $ 3,845.4 $ 3,238.2 19 % Operating Income Margin 18.7 % 17.0 % 1.7 Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $607 million to $3.85 billion in 2011. The increase was due to acquisitions, including Dionex, higher revenue at existing businesses and, to a lesser extent, the favorable effects of currency translation. Had Dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of 2010, pro forma revenues would have increased $349 million (10%) over pro forma 2010 revenues, including increases of $47 million due to other acquisitions, $95 million due to the favorable Financial Statement Index 41 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) effects of currency translation and $207 million (6%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The increase in pro forma revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand. Demand was particularly strong for instruments serving industrial and applied markets. The increase in revenues was offset in part by lower stimulus-funded sales in Japan in the first quarter of 2011 which decreased pro forma growth by 1 percentage point. Operating income margin was 18.7% in 2011 and 17.0% in 2010. The increase resulted from productivity improvements and, to a lesser extent, accretive acquisitions, price increases and profit on incremental sales at existing businesses. These increases were offset in part by higher spending on research and development initiatives. Specialty Diagnostics (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 Change Revenues $ 2,469.9 $ 2,149.0 15 % Operating Income Margin 24.2 % 22.7 % 1.5 Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $321 million to $2.47 billion in 2011. The increase was due to acquisitions, including Phadia, higher revenue at existing businesses and the favorable effects of currency translation. Had Phadia and the company been combined from the beginning of 2010, pro forma revenues would have increased $210 million (8%) over pro forma 2010 revenues, including increases of $21 million due to other acquisitions, $68 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation and $121 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The increase in pro forma revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand. Demand was particularly strong for immunodiagnostics and clinical diagnostics products. The increase in demand was offset in part by cessation of a supply contract, discussed below, which decreased pro forma growth by 2 percentage points. In November 2009, a significant supplier of the company’s healthcare market channel notified the company that it intended to cease an existing supply arrangement in mid-2010. The company believes this was in part a response to the company’s strategic decision to expand its product offerings to provide its customers with a broader menu of diagnostic solutions. The company signed an agreement with an alternative supplier of laboratory products and is selling these and other products from the new supplier, offsetting a portion of the drop in revenue. As a result of these events, sales were unfavorably affected by $54 million, net, in the first half of 2011. Operating income margin was 24.2% in 2011 and 22.7% in 2010. The increase resulted from productivity improvements and, to a lesser extent, profit on incremental sales at existing businesses and accretive acquisitions. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 Change Revenues $ 5,762.9 $ 5,473.0 5 % Operating Income Margin 14.1 % 14.3 % (0.2 ) Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $290 million to $5.76 billion in 2011. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $107 million in 2011. Sales increased $57 million due to acquisitions. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $126 million (2%) primarily due to increased demand. Demand for clinical trials logistics services was particularly strong. Financial Statement Index 42 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Operating income margin decreased to 14.1% in 2011 from 14.3% in 2010, primarily due to inflationary pressures on costs, particularly oil-based raw materials such as plastic resin, and, to a lesser extent, commercial investments including expansion of sales and marketing staff in the Asia/Pacific region and information technology initiatives in Europe. These decreases were offset in part by productivity improvements. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $118 million and $100 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively (Note 4). The increase was primarily due to a $91 million increase in interest expense, offset in part by higher other items, net and higher interest income. The increase in interest expense was related to the debt issued to fund the Phadia and Dionex acquisitions, offset in part by having refinanced higher-rate debt during 2010. In 2011, other items, net includes a $28 million gain on currency exchange contracts associated with the Phadia acquisition and repayment of its multi-currency debt and an $18 million gain on the sale of an investment accounted for under the cost method, offset in part by $10 million of fees associated with short-term financing commitments to fund the Phadia acquisition. In 2010, other items, net includes a $17 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt and $8 million of fees associated with short-term financing commitments for the Dionex acquisition. Provision for Income Taxes The company’s effective tax rates were 9.7% and 9.3% in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the items discussed below, offset in part by increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions including the effect of the Phadia acquisition. The tax provision in 2011 was unfavorably affected by $12 million, or 1.0 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, offset in part by $8 million, or 0.7 percentage points, by the ability to use tax loss carryforwards as a result of the Phadia acquisition. The tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by $17 million or 1.6 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates. Discontinued Operations As described above, the company sold two businesses in April 2011, and another business in October 2012. The results of these businesses have been included in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented (Note 15). After-tax income from discontinued operations was $1.7 million and $47.0 million, in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The sale of the two businesses sold in 2011 resulted in an after-tax gain of $304 million or $0.79 per diluted share. The company also received additional proceeds from a previously divested business in 2011, resulting in an after-tax gain of $1 million. During 2010, the company recorded additional proceeds related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after-tax gain of $2.5 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $2.74 billion at December 31, 2012, compared with $1.71 billion at December 31, 2011. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $855 million at December 31, 2012 and $1.02 billion at December 31, 2011. The increase in working capital is primarily due to earnings before amortization and depreciation, offset in part by the repurchase of the company’s common stock. Financial Statement Index 43 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) 2012 Cash provided by operating activities was $2.04 billion during 2012. An increase in inventories used cash of $60 million, primarily to support growth in sales. An increase in other assets used cash of $100 million primarily related to the timing of tax refunds. An increase in other liabilities provided cash of $127 million, primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation and income taxes. Cash payments for income taxes of continuing operations totaled $331 million during 2012, compared with $353 million in the prior year. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $64 million during 2012. During 2012, the company’s primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $1.08 billion for acquisitions and $315 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company’s discontinued operations provided $59 million of cash, primarily tax benefits from the loss on sale of the laboratory workstations business and receipt of escrowed proceeds from the 2011 sale of Lancaster Laboratories. The company’s financing activities used $918 million of cash during 2012, principally for the repurchase of $1.15 billion of the company’s common stock and to reduce commercial paper obligations by $849 million, offset in part by the issuance of $1.3 billion in senior notes (Note 9). The company’s financing activities also included the repayment of $355 million of long-term debt and $254 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises. In February 2012, the company initiated a quarterly cash dividend. Cash dividend payments totaled $142 million during 2012. On November 8, 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of the company’s common stock beginning January 1, 2013. As of December 31, 2012, the company’s short-term debt totaled $93 million, including $50 million of commercial paper obligations. The company has revolving credit facilities with a bank group that provide up to $2.0 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. The credit facilities include a $1 billion 5-year credit agreement, with the ability to request an additional $500 million, plus a $500 million 364-day credit agreement. If the company borrows under these facilities, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2012, no borrowings were outstanding under either facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $50 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. The company believes that its existing cash and short-term investments of $855 million as of December 31, 2012, and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreements are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2011 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.69 billion during 2011. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $101 million and $29 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. An increase in other assets used cash of $137 million primarily due to the timing of tax refunds. An increase in accounts payable provided cash of $34 million, primarily due to higher inventory purchases. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $69 million during 2011. During 2011, the company’s primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $5.69 billion for acquisitions and $261 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company’s continuing operations had cash proceeds from a divestiture of $14 million and the company’s discontinued operations had net cash proceeds of $746 million, primarily from the sale of Athena and Lancaster. Financial Statement Index 44 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) The company’s financing activities provided $3.55 billion of cash during 2011, principally $5.15 billion from the issuance of debt to fund acquisitions, offset in part by the repurchase of $1.34 billion of the company’s common stock. Following issuance of a redemption notice for the remaining $329 million principal outstanding of the company’s 3.25% Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2024, all of the balance was converted or redeemed for a total cash outlay of $452 million. The company’s financing activities in 2011 also included $158 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises. 2010 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.50 billion during 2010. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $71 million and $24 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Increases in other assets used cash of $78 million, primarily due to the timing of value added tax (VAT) refunds and prepaid expenses. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $370 million in 2010, compared with $330 million in 2009 due to an increase in taxable income. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $47 million during 2010. During 2010, the company’s primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $606 million for acquisitions and $245 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities used $1.30 billion of cash during 2010, principally for the extinguishment of debt and repurchase of $1.01 billion of the company’s common stock, offset in part by the net proceeds for the issuance of long-term debt of $741 million. The company used the net proceeds from the issuance of debt and existing cash balances to convert all of the $326 million principal outstanding on its Floating Rate Convertible Debentures due 2033 for a total cash outlay of $573 million and to redeem all of its $500 million outstanding 6 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes at a redemption price of $1,030.63 per $1,000 principal amount for a total cash outlay of $515 million. The company’s financing activities in 2010 also included $77 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2010 - 2012 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, a build-to-suit lease arrangement entered in 2012, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table or discussed below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $35.6 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the company’s own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 45 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

(b) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (c) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $165 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2013, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $300 to $325 million. A guarantee of residual value under a build-to-suit lease arrangement for a facility that will be leased upon completion of construction has not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantee may require payment. Upon completion of construction in 2014, a five-year lease will commence with options to purchase the facility or renew the lease for up to three 5-year terms. The residual value guarantee becomes operative at the end of the lease for up to a maximum of $58 million. Financial Statement Index 46 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and related legal fees. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business – Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Swedish krona and Australian dollars. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2012, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2012 was $7.56 billion (see Note 12). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2012 would increase by approximately $386 million. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2012 would decrease by approximately $363 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euro, Swedish krona, British pounds sterling, Danish krone and Canadian dollars. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2012 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $757 million. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in Financial Statement Index 47 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) year-end 2012 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $54 million. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2012 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $54 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2012 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $14 million on the company’s net income.",2023-12-30 17:37:55.378083
97745,TMO,THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.,2014,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reference is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report. Overview The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s continuing operations fall into three business segments (see Note 3): Analytical Technologies, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services. Recent and Pending Acquisitions and Divestitures The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2012 and its 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies. The company’s principal 2012 acquisitions are described below. · One Lambda, a provider of transplant diagnostics, was acquired in September 2012 to enhance the company’s presence in specialty in vitro diagnostics and to increase access to the transplant diagnostics market. · Doe & Ingalls, a channel for specialty production chemicals and provider of customized supply-chain services to the life sciences and microelectronics industries, was acquired in May 2012 to expand the company’s products and services that address the production market. In addition, on April 14, 2013, the company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Life Technologies providing for the acquisition of Life Technologies by the company (the “Life Technologies Acquisition”) at a price of approximately $13.6 billion in cash ($76.1311786 per share), plus the assumption of certain Life Technologies indebtedness (Note 2). Life Technologies provides innovative products and services to customers conducting scientific research and genetic analysis, as well as those in applied markets, such as forensics and food safety testing. Life Technologies’ revenues totaled $3.9 billion in 2013. The acquisition was completed on February 3, 2014. Life Technologies will be reported in a new segment, Life Sciences Solutions, together with most of the company’s existing biosciences businesses. The company completed its permanent financing arrangements for the Life Technologies Acquisition in December 2013. The financing consists of a term loan agreement (the “Term Credit Facility”), proceeds from issuance of senior debt and commercial paper, proceeds from equity forward agreements and cash on hand. These arrangements are discussed below under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources”. In December 2013, the company entered an agreement to sell its sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses to GE Healthcare for approximately $1.06 billion. The businesses fall principally in the Analytical Technologies segment. Divestiture of these businesses was a condition to obtaining antitrust approval for the Life Technologies Acquisition. As of December 31, 2013, the agreement to sell the businesses was contingent on, among other things, obtaining antitrust approval for the acquisition of Life Technologies. That approval was obtained in January 2014 at which time these businesses were designated as held for sale. Revenues and operating income in 2013 of the businesses to be sold were approximately $250 million and $80 million, respectively. The sale is subject to additional regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity In February 2013, in connection with a change in management responsibility for two product lines with aggregate annual revenues of approximately $100 million, the company transferred its water analysis and research serum and media product lines to the Laboratory Products and Services segment from the Analytical Technologies segment. The company has historically moved a product line between segments when a shift in strategic focus of either the product line or a segment more closely aligns the product line with a segment different than that in which it had previously been reported. Prior period segment information has been reclassified to reflect these transfers. Financial Statement Index 31 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 Revenues Analytical Technologies $ 4,125.1 31.5 % $ 4,017.9 32.1 % Specialty Diagnostics 3,191.7 24.4 % 2,962.3 23.7 % Laboratory Products and Services 6,350.5 48.5 % 6,053.7 48.4 % Eliminations (577.0 ) (4.4 )% (524.0 ) (4.2 )% $ 13,090.3 100 % $ 12,509.9 100 % Sales in 2013 were $13.09 billion, an increase of $580 million from 2012. Sales increased $188 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $36 million in 2013. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $429 million (3%) primarily due to increased demand offset in part by modestly lower sales to customers in academic and government markets which the company believes was due in part to uncertainty in government funding expectations in the U.S. Sales remained strong to customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries while sales to customers in industrial markets grew modestly. Sales growth was strong in Asia and modest in Europe and North America. In 2013, total company operating income and operating income margin were $1.61 billion and 12.3%, respectively, compared with $1.48 billion and 11.8%, respectively, in 2012. The increase in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and, to a lesser extent, profit on incremental sales from acquisitions. The increase was offset in part by strategic growth investments, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and, to a lesser extent, $24 million of higher acquisition-related charges in 2013, an increase in amortization expense of $16 million in 2013 primarily related to the acquisitions of One Lambda and Doe & Ingalls and imposition of a medical device excise tax in 2013. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. The company’s effective tax rates were 3.1% and 0.9% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization, the company’s cash payments (net of refunds) for income taxes for its continuing operations were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $230 million and $331 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Tax payments decreased in 2013 due primarily to refunds of taxes paid in 2012. In 2013, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the U.S. which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $160 million offset by additional U.S. income taxes of $56 million on the related foreign income. The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $104 million and reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 7.9 percentage points in 2013. In addition, the effective tax rate in 2013 was also reduced by the U.S. Congress’ renewal in January 2013 of a tax credit for research and development activities for 2012 and 2013 and, to a lesser extent, increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions and financing costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies that are deductible in the U.S. The tax credit for 2012 and 2013 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2013 by $15.4 million, or 1.2 percentage points. The tax provision in the 2013 period was unfavorably affected by $5.4 million, or 0.4 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates and audit settlements. The tax provision in 2012 was favorably affected by $53 million, or 4.1 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, particularly a lower tax rate in Sweden. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2014 will be between 2% and 5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax credit for research and development activities has not been extended by the U.S. Congress as of February 26, 2014. Financial Statement Index 32 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) Income from continuing operations increased to $1.28 billion in 2013, from $1.26 billion in 2012, primarily due to improved operating performance, offset in part by $126 million of costs related to the acquisition and financing of Life Technologies. During 2013, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $2.01 billion (after deducting $5 million used by discontinued operations), compared with $2.04 billion (after deducting $28 million from discontinued operations) for 2012. The decrease resulted in part from cash disbursements for fees paid to obtain bridge financing commitments and other transaction costs, totaling $108 million, related to the acquisition of Life Technologies. In addition, higher increases in working capital items than in 2012 were partially offset in part by higher income before amortization and depreciation in 2013 compared to 2012. As of December 31, 2013, the company’s short-term debt totaled $988 million, including $250 million of commercial paper obligations and $706 million of senior notes, due in 2014. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $1.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2013, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $43 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Of the company’s existing cash and short-term investments of $5.83 billion as of December 31, 2013, $5.18 billion was available to partially fund the acquisition of Life Technologies in February 2014. The company believes that the remaining balance of approximately $650 million and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing and Life Technologies businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, equity investments, sales returns, warranty obligations, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, pension costs and stock-based compensation. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: (a) Accounts Receivable The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such allowances totaled $54 million at December 31, 2013. The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. Financial Statement Index 33 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) (b) Inventories The company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required. (c) Intangible Assets and Goodwill The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $5.73 billion at December 31, 2013. The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $12.50 billion and $1.34 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2013. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. Growth at some of the company’s businesses slowed in 2011 – 2013 which the company believes was in part due to uncertainty in funding expectations of customers in academic and government markets and economic uncertainty including a slow-down in Southern Europe. Projections of profitability for 2014 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2013, the date of the company’s impairment testing. There can be no assurance, however, that the slowing of growth experienced in 2011 - 2013 at some businesses will not continue or worsen in 2014 and that a downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary. Financial Statement Index 34 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company’s ImmunoDiagnostics reporting unit was created with the acquisition of the Phadia Group in August 2011. Because this reporting unit consists solely of the acquired business, its book value equaled its fair value as of the acquisition date and thus, no cushion of fair value over book value existed at that date. During its 2013 goodwill impairment testing, the company determined that the ImmunoDiagnostics reporting unit’s cushion of fair value over book value had increased from 0% at the acquisition date to 11% as of November 1, 2013. Despite this favorable increase, given that the fair value is not substantially in excess of the book value, relatively small decreases in future cash flows from forecasted results or changes in discount rates or other assumptions could result in impairment of goodwill. The key variables that drive the cash flows of the reporting unit are levels of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) rate applied. The estimates used for these assumptions represent management's best estimates, which the company believes are reasonable. These assumptions, however, are subject to uncertainty, including the degree to which the acquired business will grow revenue and profitability levels. The ImmunoDiagnostics reporting unit had $1.80 billion of goodwill, and had an overall carrying value of $3.31 billion as of December 31, 2013. (d) Other Long-lived Assets The company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Other long-lived assets totaled $2.41 billion at December 31, 2013, including $1.77 billion of fixed assets. In testing a long-lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset-related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long-lived assets may be necessary. (e) Revenues In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale. Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change, the company’s revenue recognition would be affected. In instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing. The company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or “elements.” The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements other than post-contract support is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately. The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required. Financial Statement Index 35 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) (f) Warranty Obligations At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of standard product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for warranty obligations of the company’s continuing operations totaled $50 million at December 31, 2013. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary. (g) Income Taxes In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. The company’s reserve for these matters totaled $134 million at December 31, 2013. Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes. The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income. The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $77 million at December 31, 2013. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the company’s tax provision would result. Financial Statement Index 36 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) (h) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Reserves of acquired businesses, including product liability and environmental reserves, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. (i) Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Several of the company’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $29 million in 2013. The company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $301 million at year-end 2013 compared with $408 million at year-end 2012. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $3 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $85 million. As of December 31, 2013, the company expects to contribute between $30 and $40 million to its existing defined benefit pension plans in 2014. (j) Stock-based Compensation The fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for determining the expected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The dividend yield is based on the company’s most recent quarterly dividend rate. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock-based compensation. The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures. If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required. Financial Statement Index 37 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Sales increased $188 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $36 million in 2013. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $429 million (3%) primarily due to increased demand offset in part by modestly lower sales to customers in academic and government markets which the company believes was due in part to uncertainty in government funding expectations in the U.S. Sales remained strong to customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries while sales growth was modest to customers in industrial markets. Sales growth was strong in Asia and modest in Europe and North America. In 2013, total company operating income and operating income margin were $1.61 billion and 12.3%, respectively, compared with $1.48 billion and 11.8%, respectively, in 2012. The increase in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and, to a lesser extent, profit on incremental sales from acquisitions. The increase was offset in part by strategic growth investments, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and, to a lesser extent, $24 million of higher acquisition-related charges in 2013, an increase in amortization expense of $16 million in 2013 primarily related to the acquisitions of One Lambda and Doe & Ingalls and imposition of a medical device excise tax in 2013. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. In 2013, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $180 million, including $29 million of charges to cost of revenues related primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $74 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses consisting primarily of transaction costs related to the acquisition of Life Technologies, revisions of estimated contingent consideration for a recent acquisition and a charge associated with product liability litigation. The company incurred $78 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, such as the consolidation of several facilities in the U.S. and Europe (see Note 14). The cash costs also included $4 million of transaction expenses related to the agreement to sell its sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses (see Note 2). In 2012, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $150 million, including $56 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and $13 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consisting of transaction costs related to the acquisition of One Lambda. The company incurred $67 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded $15 million of non-cash expense, net, primarily for the impairment of intangible asset at several small business units and, to a lesser extent, real estate writedowns related to facility consolidations partially offset by a $6 million gain from the settlement of pre-acquisition litigation. Financial Statement Index 38 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) As of February 27, 2014, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $50 million in 2014 and expects to identify additional actions during 2014, including some related to the acquisition of Life Technologies. The restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2013 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $80 million beginning in part in 2013 and, to a greater extent, in 2014, including $35 million in the Analytical Technologies segment, $20 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $25 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2012 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $85 million beginning in part in 2012 and to a greater extent in 2013, including $40 million in the Analytical Technologies segment, $20 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $25 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The company expects significant restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2014 in connection with the acceleration of certain equity awards held by Life Technologies’ employees and severance obligations payable to former Life Technologies’ executives. Segment Results The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis. Financial Statement Index 39 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Sales increased $123 million (3%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $9 million due to acquisitions. These increases were offset in part by a decrease of $25 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments as well as bioscience products, offset in part by lower sales of chemical analysis products which the company believes were affected by macro economic conditions facing customers in industrial markets. Operating income margin was 18.6% in 2013 compared to 18.6% in 2012. Operating margin was favorably affected by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset by strategic growth investments and unfavorable foreign currency exchange.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Specialty Diagnostics (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 Change Revenues $ 3,191.7 $ 2,962.3 8 % Operating Income Margin 27.2 % 25.7 % 1.5pt Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $229 million to $3.19 billion in 2013. Sales increased $143 million due to an acquisition and $92 million (3%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. These increases were offset in part by a decrease of $5 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand, particularly for clinical diagnostics products and, to a lesser extent, microbiology and allergy products in part as a result of strong flu and pollen seasons, partially offset by weakness from reduced healthcare utilization and lower sales of instruments to diagnostic laboratories due in part to lower healthcare reimbursement rates in the U.S. for anatomical pathology tests. Operating income margin was 27.2% in 2013 and 25.7% in 2012. The increase resulted from profit on incremental sales from an acquisition and, to a lesser extent, at existing businesses as well as productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. The increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments and imposition of the medical device excise tax in 2013. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 Change Revenues $ 6,350.5 $ 6,053.7 5 % Operating Income Margin 14.5 % 14.4 % 0.1pt Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $297 million to $6.35 billion in 2013. Sales increased $267 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $36 million due to an acquisition. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $6 million in 2013. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for laboratory products and clinical trial logistics services. Sales of laboratory equipment increased only modestly due to weakness in demand from customers in academic and government markets. Operating income margin was 14.5% in 2013 and 14.4% in 2012. The increase was primarily due to productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, price increases, offset in part by strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $290 million and $213 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively (Note 4). In the first quarter of 2013, the company irrevocably contributed appreciated available-for-sale investments that had a fair value of $27 million to two of its U.K. defined benefit plans, resulting in realization of a previously unrecognized gain of $11 million. In 2013, other items, net also includes $74 million of charges related to amortization of fees paid to obtain bridge financing commitments related to the Life Technologies Acquisition, offset in part by gains totaling $5 million from sales of equity investments. Interest expense increased $21 million primarily due to the debt issued to fund the One Lambda and Life Technologies acquisitions. Financial Statement Index 41 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Provision for Income Taxes The company’s effective tax rates were 3.1% and 0.9% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization, the company’s cash payments (net of refunds) for income taxes for its continuing operations were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $230 million and $331 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Tax payments decreased in 2013 due primarily to refunds of taxes paid in 2012. In 2013, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the U.S. which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $160 million offset by additional U.S. income taxes of $56 million on the related foreign income. The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $104 million and reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 7.9 percentage points in 2013. In addition, the effective tax rate in 2013 was also reduced by the U.S. Congress’ renewal in January 2013 of a tax credit for research and development activities for 2012 and 2013 and, to a lesser extent, increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions and financing costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies that are deductible in the U.S. The tax credit for 2012 and 2013 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2013 by $15.4 million, or 1.2 percentage points. The tax provision in the 2013 period was unfavorably affected by $5.4 million, or 0.4 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates and audit settlements. The tax provision in 2012 was favorably affected by $53 million, or 4.1 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, particularly a lower tax rate in Sweden. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2014 will be between 2% and 5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The tax credit for research and development activities has not been extended by the U.S. Congress as of February 26, 2014. The company has operations and a taxable presence in nearly 50 countries outside of the U.S. All of these countries except three have a lower tax rate than the U.S. The countries in which the company has a material presence that have significantly lower tax rates than the U.S. include Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate. Discontinued Operations On June 22, 2012, in an effort to exit a non-core business, the company’s senior management made a decision to pursue a sale of its laboratory workstations business, part of the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The company completed the sale in October 2012 for nominal proceeds. Revenues of the laboratory workstations business were $147 million in the 2012 period prior to the sale. The business incurred a pre-tax loss of $30 million in 2012 due to inventory write-offs, higher manufacturing costs and restructuring and other transition costs associated with relocation of the business. In 2012, the company recorded after-tax charges aggregating $63 million as the loss on the divestiture. The loss in 2013 for discontinued operations primarily represents a charge for the cost of razing abandoned facilities of the business prior to sale of the land. The results of the laboratory workstations business have been included in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2013, the FASB issued new guidance which requires disclosure of information about significant reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in a single note or on the face of the financial statements. This guidance became effective for the company in 2013. Adoption of this standard, which is related to disclosure only, did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Financial Statement Index 42 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) In July 2012, the FASB modified existing rules to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The revised standard allows an entity the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. An entity is not required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. This guidance became effective for the company in 2013. Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2011, the FASB issued new guidance which requires enhanced disclosures on offsetting amounts within the balance sheet, including disclosing gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset or subject to a master netting or similar agreement. This guidance became effective for the company in 2013. Adoption of this standard, which is related to disclosure only, did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Contingent Liabilities The company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An outcome that differs materially from current reserve estimates for one or more of the matters described in Note 10 or Item 3 of this Form 10-K could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. 2012 Compared With 2011 Continuing Operations Sales in 2012 were $12.51 billion, an increase of $951 million from 2011. The increase was due to acquisitions, including Phadia and Dionex, and, higher sales at existing businesses, offset in part by the unfavorable effects of currency translation. Had Phadia, Dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of 2011, revenues would have increased $403 million (3%) over pro forma 2011 revenues, including $474 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $156 million due to other acquisitions, net of divestitures, offset in part by $227 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The pro forma increase in revenues was primarily due to increased demand. Sales growth was strong in Asia and moderate in North America and Europe. Demand from customers in academic and government markets slowed such that growth was nominal in 2012 and demand from customers in industrial markets slowed such that growth was nominal in the second half of 2012. In 2012, total company operating income and operating income margin were $1.48 billion and 11.8%, respectively, compared with $1.25 billion and 10.8%, respectively, in 2011. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on incremental sales from acquisitions and existing businesses and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and $84 million of lower acquisition-related charges in 2012. The increase was offset in part by strategic growth investments and an increase in amortization expense of $100 million in 2012, primarily related to the acquisitions of Phadia and Dionex. In 2012, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $150 million, including $56 million of charges to cost of revenues related primarily to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and $13 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses consisting primarily of transaction costs related to the acquisition of One Lambda. The company incurred $67 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, such as the consolidation of several facilities in the U.S. and Europe. The company also recorded $15 million of non-cash expense, net, primarily for the impairment of intangible assets at several small business units and, to a lesser extent, real estate writedowns related to facility consolidations partially offset by a $6 million gain from the settlement of pre-acquisition litigation. Financial Statement Index 43 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) In 2011, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $231 million, including $73 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and $62 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Dionex and Phadia. The company incurred $81 million of cash restructuring costs, including $21 million of cash compensation from monetizing equity awards held by Dionex employees at the date of acquisition. The cash costs also include continuing costs associated with headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded $15 million of non-cash expense, net, primarily for the impairment of intangible assets at several small business units and, to a lesser extent, a loss on sale of a heating equipment business. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2011 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $80 million beginning in part in 2011 and to a greater extent in 2012, including $30 million in the Analytical Technologies segment, $15 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $35 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.

The increase was due to acquisitions, including Dionex, and higher revenue at existing businesses, offset in part by the unfavorable effects of currency translation. Had Dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of 2011, revenues would have increased $104 million (3%) over pro forma 2011 revenues, including an increase of $183 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $2 million due to acquisitions, net of a disposition, offset in part by $81 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The pro forma increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand across the segment’s range of analytical instruments and for bioscience products, offset in part by lower sales to customers in academic and government markets. Financial Statement Index 45 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Operating income margin was 18.6% in both 2012 and 2011. Profit from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, from incremental sales at existing businesses was substantially offset by higher spending on commercial initiatives and unfavorable currency translation. Specialty Diagnostics (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Change Revenues $ 2,962.3 $ 2,469.9 20 % Operating Income Margin 25.7 % 24.2 % 1.5 Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $492 million to $2.96 billion in 2012. The increase was due to acquisitions, including Phadia, and higher revenue at existing businesses, offset in part by the unfavorable effects of currency translation. Had Phadia and the company been combined from the beginning of 2011, revenues would have increased $118 million (4%) over pro forma 2011 revenues, including increases of $103 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $80 million due to other acquisitions, offset in part by $65 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The pro forma increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for clinical diagnostic products and, to a lesser extent, microbiology products. Operating income margin was 25.7% in 2012 and 24.2% in 2011. The increase resulted primarily from the accretive Phadia acquisition and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and profit on incremental sales at existing businesses. The increases were offset in part by higher spending on commercial initiatives. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2012 2011 Change Revenues $ 6,053.7 $ 5,831.2 4 % Operating Income Margin 14.4 % 14.3 % 0.1 Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $223 million to $6.05 billion in 2012. Sales increased $74 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $89 million in 2012. In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $238 million (4%) primarily due to increased demand for laboratory consumables and, to a lesser extent, clinical trial logistics services. The increase in demand was offset in part by lower sales of laboratory equipment, particularly to customers in academic and government markets. Operating income margin was 14.4% in 2012 and 14.3% in 2011. The increase resulted from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by lower sales of higher margin laboratory equipment and higher spending on commercial initiatives. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $213 million and $118 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $66 million in interest expense related to the debt issued to fund the Phadia and Dionex acquisitions. In 2011, other items, net included a $28 million gain on currency exchange contracts associated with the Phadia acquisition and repayment of its multi-currency debt and an $18 million gain on the sale of an investment accounted for under the cost method, offset in part by $10 million of fees associated with short-term financing commitments to fund the Phadia acquisition. Financial Statement Index 46 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Provision for Income Taxes The company’s effective tax rates were 0.9% and 9.7% in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization, the company’s cash payments for income taxes for its continuing operations were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $331 million and $353 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due in part to increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions including the effect of the Phadia acquisition. The tax provision in 2012 was favorably affected by $53 million, or 4.1 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, particularly a lower tax rate in Sweden. The tax provision in 2011 was unfavorably affected by $12 million, or 1.0 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, offset in part by $8 million, or 0.7 percentage points, by the ability to use tax loss carryforwards as a result of the Phadia acquisition. Discontinued Operations The company placed its laboratory workstations business for sale in June 2012 and reclassified its accounts and results to discontinued operations for all periods presented. Revenues of the laboratory workstations business were $147 million in the 2012 period prior to the sale, compared to $180 million in 2011. The business incurred a pre-tax loss of $30 million in 2012 compared with a pre-tax loss of $6 million in 2011 due to inventory write-offs, higher manufacturing costs and restructuring and other transition costs associated with relocation of the business. In 2012, the company recorded after-tax charges aggregating $63 million as the loss on the divestiture. The business was sold in October 2012 for nominal proceeds. On April 4, 2011, the company sold, in separate transactions, its Athena Diagnostics business (Athena) for $740 million in cash and its Lancaster Laboratories business (Lancaster) for $180 million in cash and escrowed proceeds of $20 million, substantially all of which was received in October 2012. The sale of these businesses resulted in an after-tax gain of $304 million or $0.79 per diluted share. Revenues and operating income of the two businesses aggregated approximately $225 million and $60 million, respectively, in 2010. The results of both businesses have been included in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $6.75 billion at December 31, 2013, compared with $2.74 billion at December 31, 2012. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $5.83 billion at December 31, 2013 and $810 million at December 31, 2012. The increase in working capital is primarily due to the issuance of $3.20 billion of long-term debt to fund the acquisition of Life Technologies and, to a lesser extent, earnings before amortization and depreciation and proceeds from the issuance of the company’s common stock under employees’ stock plans, offset in part by the payment of dividends and the repurchase of the company’s common stock. 2013 Cash provided by operating activities was $2.01 billion during 2013. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $148 million and $72 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. A decrease in other assets provided cash of $169 million primarily due to the timing of income tax refunds. An increase in accounts payable provided cash of $47 million, primarily due to higher inventory purchases. An increase in other liabilities provided cash of $163 million primarily due to the timing of payments for income taxes and incentive compensation. In 2013, the company paid fees to obtain bridge financing commitments and other transaction costs totaling $108 million related to the acquisition of Life Technologies. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $38 million during 2013. Cash payments for income taxes of continuing operations decreased to $230 million during 2013, compared with $331 million in the prior year, primarily related to refunds due from 2012. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $69 million during 2013. Financial Statement Index 47 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) During 2013, the company’s primary investing activities were the purchase of $282 million of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities provided $3.31 billion of cash during 2013. To partially fund the acquisition of Life Technologies, the company issued $3.20 billion of senior notes. The company’s financing activities also included $230 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises offset by the repurchase of $90 million of the company’s common stock and the payment of $216 million in cash dividends. On November 8, 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.00 billion of the company’s common stock beginning January 1, 2013. At December 31, 2013, $910 million was available for future repurchases of the company’s common stock under this authorization. In connection with the acquisition of Life Technologies, the company suspended repurchases of its common stock at the end of the first quarter of 2013. As of December 31, 2013, the company’s short-term debt totaled $988 million, including $250 million of commercial paper obligations and $706 million of senior notes, due in 2014. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $1.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2013, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $43 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. In January 2014, the company borrowed $5.00 billion under its Term Credit Facility and committed to make scheduled repayments through 2017. In addition, in January and February 2014, the company issued 34.9 million shares under equity forward and subscription agreements for aggregate proceeds of $2.94 billion. Proceeds from the Term Credit Facility and the equity forward agreements and cash on hand were used to fund the $13.6 billion cash purchase price of Life Technologies. The financial covenants of the Term Credit Facility and revolving credit facility require the company to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of debt to EBITDA (as defined in the agreements) below 5.5 to 1.0 during the first six months after the closing date of the Life Technologies Acquisition and decreasing, based on the passage of time, to 3.5 to 1.0, after 18 months. The company must also maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0. Approximately half of the company’s cash balances, aside from approximately $5.18 billion of cash held at year-end to fund the Life Technologies Acquisition, and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the U.S. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. foreign tax credit equals or exceeds any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. Of the company’s existing cash and short-term investments of $5.83 billion as of December 31, 2013, $5.18 billion was available to partially fund the acquisition of Life Technologies in February 2014. The company believes that the remaining balance of approximately $650 million and the company’s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing and Life Technologies businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) 2012 Cash provided by operating activities was $2.04 billion during 2012. An increase in inventories used cash of $60 million, primarily to support growth in sales. An increase in other assets used cash of $100 million primarily related to the timing of tax refunds. An increase in other liabilities provided cash of $127 million, primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation and income taxes. Cash payments for income taxes of continuing operations totaled $331 million during 2012. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $64 million during 2012. During 2012, the company’s primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $1.08 billion for acquisitions and $315 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company’s investing activities also included a $45 million increase in restricted cash to collateralize short-term borrowings in Asia. The company’s discontinued operations provided $59 million of cash, primarily tax benefits from the loss on sale of the laboratory workstations business and receipt of escrowed proceeds from the 2011 sale of Lancaster Laboratories. The company’s financing activities used $918 million of cash during 2012, principally for the repurchase of $1.15 billion of the company’s common stock and to reduce commercial paper obligations by $849 million, offset in part by the issuance of $1.3 billion in senior notes. The company’s financing activities in 2012 also included the repayment of $355 million of long-term debt and the receipt of $254 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Cash dividend payments totaled $142 million during 2012. 2011 Cash provided by operating activities was $1.69 billion during 2011. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $101 million and $29 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. An increase in other assets used cash of $137 million primarily due to the timing of tax refunds. An increase in accounts payable provided cash of $34 million, primarily due to higher inventory purchases. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $69 million during 2011. During 2011, the company’s primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $5.69 billion for acquisitions and $261 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company’s continuing operations had cash proceeds from a divestiture of $14 million and the company’s discontinued operations had net cash proceeds of $746 million, primarily from the sale of Athena and Lancaster. The company’s financing activities provided $3.55 billion of cash during 2011, principally $5.15 billion from the issuance of debt to fund acquisitions, offset in part by the repurchase of $1.34 billion of the company’s common stock. Following issuance of a redemption notice for the remaining $329 million principal outstanding of the company’s 3.25% Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2024, all of the balance was converted or redeemed for a total cash outlay of $452 million. The company’s financing activities in 2011 also included $158 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2011 - 2013 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, a build-to-suit lease arrangement entered in 2012, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table or discussed below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $4.8 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the company’s own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 49 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the company’s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2013.

(b) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (c) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. The contractual obligation at December 31, 2013 to purchase Life Technologies for $13.6 billion plus the assumption of debt has been omitted from the above table. The acquisition was completed on February 3, 2014. Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $134 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2014, such expenditures for its existing and Life Technologies businesses will approximate $470 to $490 million. Financial Statement Index 50 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) A guarantee of residual value under a build-to-suit lease arrangement for a facility that will be leased upon completion of construction has not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantee may require payment. Upon completion of construction in 2014, a five-year lease will commence with options to purchase the facility or renew the lease for up to three 5-year terms. The residual value guarantee becomes operative at the end of the lease for up to a maximum of $58 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and related legal fees. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business – Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Australian dollars and Swedish krona. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2013, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2013 was $10.60 billion (see Note 12). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2013 would increase by approximately $523 million. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2013 would decrease by approximately $482 million. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. A 100-basis -point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2013 would increase the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $9 million. Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in Swedish krona, euro, British pounds sterling, Danish krone and Canadian dollars. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2013 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $758 million. Financial Statement Index 51 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2013 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $85 million. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2013 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $85 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2013 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $16 million on the company’s net income.",2023-12-30 17:37:56.291522

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Reference is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report. Overview The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s continuing operations fall into four business segments (see Note 3): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services. Recent Acquisitions and Divestitures The company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as its 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies. On February 3, 2014, the company completed the acquisition of Life Technologies Corporation for a total purchase price of $15.30 billion, net of cash acquired, including the assumption of $2.28 billion of debt. The company issued debt and common stock in late 2013 and early 2014 to partially fund the acquisition discussed below under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources”. Life Technologies was integrated into the Life Sciences Solutions segment and provides innovative products and services to customers conducting scientific research and genetic analysis, as well as those in applied markets, such as forensics and food safety testing. Life Technologies’ revenues totaled $3.87 billion in 2013. On March 21, 2014, the company sold its legacy sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses to GE Healthcare for $1.06 billion, net of cash divested. The sale of these businesses resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $761 million included in restructuring and other costs (income), net. The businesses fell principally in the Life Sciences Solutions segment. Divestiture of these businesses was a condition to obtaining antitrust approval for the Life Technologies acquisition. Revenues and operating income of the businesses sold were approximately $250 million and $64 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $61 million and $12 million, respectively, in 2014 through the date of sale. On August 15, 2014, the company sold its Cole-Parmer specialty channel business, part of the Laboratory Products and Services segment, for $480 million in cash, net of cash divested. The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $134 million, included in restructuring and other costs (income), net. Revenues and operating income of the business sold were approximately $232 million and $43 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $149 million and $28 million, respectively, in 2014 through the date of sale.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) Sales in 2014 were $16.89 billion, an increase of $3.80 billion from 2013. Sales increased $3.31 billion due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $60 million in 2014. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions/divestitures, revenues increased $549 million (4%) primarily due to increased demand. Demand from biopharma customers remained strong. Sales to customers in healthcare and industrial markets grew moderately while sales to academic and government markets grew modestly in 2014. Sales growth was strong in Europe and moderate in North America and Asia. Revenues and operating income of the company’s non-U.S. operations are translated into U.S. dollars to report consolidated results. Based on weakening of currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar that occurred in late 2014 and early 2015, the company currently expects that there will be a significant adverse effect on reported amounts of revenues and operating income in 2015 as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar. In 2014, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.50 billion and 14.8%, respectively, compared with $1.61 billion and 12.3%, respectively, in 2013. The increase in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to net gains of $895 million on the sale of businesses, inclusion of Life Technologies’ results from the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. These increases were offset in part by $450 million of charges associated with the acquisition, as discussed below, as well as $569 million of higher amortization expenses, also primarily related to the acquisition. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. The company’s effective tax rates were 9.2% and 3.1% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The 2014 provision for income taxes includes $390 million related to gains on the sales of businesses. Aside from the discrete tax on the gains, the company had a benefit from income taxes primarily due to restructuring and other costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies as well as an increase in the expected benefit from foreign tax credits. In 2014, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $172 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $55 million on the related foreign income. The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $117 million and reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 5.6 percentage points in 2014. The federal tax credit for 2014 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2014 by $20.1 million, or 1.0 percentage point. In 2014, the company recognized a discrete tax benefit of $15.4 million, or 0.7 percentage points, attributable to tax rulings related to non-U.S. subsidiaries. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization, the company’s cash payments (net of refunds) for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $586 million and $230 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The effective tax rate in both periods was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in the 2014 period was favorably affected by $5.5 million, or 0.3 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates. The U.S. Congress has not extended the tax credit for research and development activities in 2015 as of February 26, 2015. In 2013, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $160 million offset by additional U.S. income taxes of $56 million on the related foreign income. The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $104 million and reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 7.9 percentage points in 2013. In addition, the effective tax rate in 2013 was also reduced by the U.S. Congress’ renewal in January 2013 of a tax credit for research and development activities for 2012 and 2013 and, to a lesser extent, financing costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies that are deductible in the U.S. The federal tax credit for 2012 and 2013 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2013 by $15.4 million, or 1.2 percentage points. The tax provision in the 2013 period was unfavorably affected by $5.4 million, or 0.4 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates and audit settlements. Financial Statement Index 28 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued) The company expects its effective tax rate in 2015 will be less than 3% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. Income from continuing operations increased to $1.90 billion in 2014, from $1.28 billion in 2013. The increase in operating income in the 2014 period (discussed above) was offset in part by an increase in the income tax provision in the 2014 period (discussed above) and an increase in interest expense of $218 million as a result of debt issued and assumed in connection with the acquisition of Life Technologies. During 2014, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $2.62 billion compared with $2.01 billion for 2013. The increase resulted from cash flow from the acquired Life Technologies operations and a lower investment in working capital items, principally due to income tax refunds and the timing of tax payments, offset in part by cash disbursements totaling $325 million related to the acquisition of Life Technologies, including severance obligations, third-party transaction/integration costs and monetizing certain equity awards held by Life Technologies employees at the date of acquisition. As of December 31, 2014, the company’s short-term debt totaled $2.21 billion, including $1.21 billion of senior notes, due in the first half of 2015 and $1.00 billion of minimum payments due in the next twelve months on the company’s term loan. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. In February 2015, the maximum capacity of this facility was increased from $1.50 billion to $2.00 billion. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $59 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. The company believes that its existing cash and short-term investments of $1.35 billion as of December 31, 2014 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, equity investments, sales returns, warranty obligations, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, pension costs and stock-based compensation. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Financial Statement Index 29 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements: (a) Accounts Receivable The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such allowances totaled $74 million at December 31, 2014. The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. (b) Inventories The company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required. (c) Intangible Assets and Goodwill The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $12.81 billion at December 31, 2014. The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $18.84 billion and $1.30 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2014. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. Projections of profitability for 2015 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2014, the date of the company’s impairment testing. There can be no assurance, however, that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary. Financial Statement Index 30 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) With the completion of the Life Technologies acquisition in February 2014, the company established a new segment and reporting unit called Life Sciences Solutions. This new segment consists of the majority of the former Life Technologies businesses and the remaining Thermo Fisher biosciences businesses following anti-trust required divestitures in March 2014. Because this segment consists primarily of the acquired business, the book value of which equaled its fair value as of the acquisition date, the company believes minimal cushion of fair value over book value existed at that date. During its 2014 goodwill impairment testing, the company determined that the Life Sciences Solutions segment’s cushion of fair value over book value had increased to 9% as of October 31, 2014. Despite this favorable increase, given that the fair value is not substantially in excess of the book value, relatively small decreases in future cash flows from forecasted results or changes in discount rates or other assumptions could result in impairment of goodwill. The key variables that drive the cash flows of the reporting unit are levels of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) rate applied. The estimates used for these assumptions represent management's best estimates, which the company believes are reasonable. These assumptions, however, are subject to uncertainty, including the degree to which the acquired business will grow revenue and profitability levels. The Life Sciences Solutions segment had $7.25 billion of goodwill, and had an overall carrying value of $14.75 billion as of December 31, 2014. (d) Other Long-lived Assets The company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Other long-lived assets totaled $3.36 billion at December 31, 2014, including $2.43 billion of fixed assets. In testing a long-lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset-related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment. Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long-lived assets may be necessary. (e) Revenues In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative selling price at the time of sale. Should the relative value of either the equipment or the installation change, the company’s revenue recognition would be affected. In instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing. Financial Statement Index 31 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) The company’s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or “elements.” The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements. In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements other than post-contract support is completed. Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately. Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately. The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required. (f) Warranty Obligations At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of standard product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns. The liability for standard warranty obligations of the company’s continuing operations totaled $58 million at December 31, 2014. Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary. (g) Income Taxes In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. The company’s reserve for these matters totaled $214 million at December 31, 2014. Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes. The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income. The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $116 million at December 31, 2014. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary. The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the company’s tax provision would result. Financial Statement Index 32 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued) (h) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Accruals of acquired businesses, including product liability and environmental accruals, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable. (i) Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Several of the company’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $56 million in 2014. The company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $540 million at year-end 2014 (including plan obligations assumed in the acquisition of Life Technologies) compared with $301 million at year-end 2013. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $1 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $108 million. As of December 31, 2014, the company expects to contribute between $40 and $60 million to its existing defined benefit pension plans in 2015. (j) Stock-based Compensation The fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company’s stock. Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for determining the expected life of an option. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The dividend yield is based on the company’s most recent quarterly dividend rate. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock-based compensation. The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures. If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required. Financial Statement Index 33 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Sales increased $3.31 billion due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $60 million in 2014. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions/divestitures, revenues increased $549 million (4%) primarily due to increased demand. Demand from biopharma customers remained strong. Sales to customers in healthcare and industrial markets grew moderately while sales to academic and government markets grew modestly in 2014. Sales growth was strong in Europe and moderate in North America and Asia. Revenues and operating income of the company’s non-U.S. operations are translated into U.S. dollars to report consolidated results. Based on weakening of currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar that occurred in late 2014 and early 2015, the company currently expects that there will be a significant adverse effect on reported amounts of revenues and operating income in 2015 as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar. In 2014, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.50 billion and 14.8%, respectively, compared with $1.61 billion and 12.3%, respectively, in 2013. The increase in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to net gains of $895 million on the sale of businesses, inclusion of Life Technologies’ results from the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. These increases were offset in part by $450 million of charges associated with the acquisition, as discussed below, as well as $569 million of higher amortization expenses, also primarily related to the acquisition. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. In 2014, the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $140 million, including net gains on the sale of businesses and real estate of $895 million and $15 million, respectively, offset in part by $328 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition; $131 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for transaction costs related to the acquisition of Life Technologies; and $29 million of charges for pension settlements. The company incurred $268 million of cash restructuring costs primarily associated with the Life Technologies acquisition including cash compensation to monetize certain equity awards held by Life Technologies employees at the date of acquisition and severance obligations to former executives and employees of Life Technologies. In addition, the company’s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, including the consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia (see Note 14). Financial Statement Index 34 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) In 2013, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $180 million, including $29 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $74 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consisting of transaction costs related to the acquisition of Life Technologies, changes in estimates of contingent consideration for an acquisition and a charge associated with product liability litigation. The company incurred $78 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that were being consolidated. The cash costs also included $4 million of transaction expenses related to the agreement to sell its sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses (see Note 2). As of February 26, 2015, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $70 million in 2015 and expects to identify additional actions during 2015 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as abandonment of leased facilities. Approximately half of the additional charges will be incurred in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, with the remainder incurred across the company’s remaining segments. The restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2014 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $120 million beginning in part in 2014 and, to a greater extent, in 2015, including $80 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $10 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $10 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $20 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2013 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $80 million beginning in part in 2013 and to a greater extent in 2014, including $5 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $30 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $20 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $25 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. Segment Results The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis. Financial Statement Index 35 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Had the acquisition of Life Technologies been completed at the beginning of 2013, pro forma revenues for the 2014 period would have decreased $38 million compared to pro forma 2013 revenues, including a decrease of $151 million due to dispositions, net of other acquisitions and a decrease of $45 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation, offset in part by an increase of $158 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The increase in pro forma revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for biosciences and bioprocess production products, offset in part by lower licensing revenues. Financial Statement Index 36 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Operating income margin was 29.0% in 2014 compared to 23.8% in 2013. The increase resulted primarily from higher operating margins in Life Technologies’ businesses relative to the segment’s legacy operations and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. The company expects the segment’s operating income margin in the first quarter of 2015 will be lower than the 29.3% reported in the first quarter of 2014. This is due to excluding the results of Life Technologies prior to the February 3, 2014 acquisition date. Results for January commonly have a lower margin rate than results for the balance of the quarter, due to the phasing of revenue and costs. Analytical Instruments (Dollars in millions) 2014 2013 Change Revenues $ 3,252.2 $ 3,154.2 3 % Operating Income Margin 17.9 % 17.7 % 0.2pt Sales in the Analytical Instruments segment increased $98 million to $3.25 billion in 2014. Sales increased $113 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $15 million due to acquisitions, offset in part by a decrease of $30 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments and, to a lesser extent, environmental instruments. These increases were offset in part by modestly lower sales of chemical analysis products due primarily to softness in certain commodity markets such as minerals. Operating income margin was 17.9% in 2014 compared to 17.7% in 2013. The increase resulted primarily from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, profit from favorable sales mix. The increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments.

Sales increased $154 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $10 million due to an acquisition net of a divestiture, offset in part by a decrease of $12 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for immunodiagnostics products, products sold through the segment’s healthcare market channel and, to a lesser extent, clinical diagnostics products. Operating income margin was 27.4% in 2014 and 27.1% in 2013. The increase resulted primarily from favorable sales mix and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. These increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments. Financial Statement Index 37 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.

Sales increased $312 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The increase was offset in part by a decrease of $93 million due to dispositions and $17 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for laboratory products and, to a lesser extent, clinical trial logistics services. Operating income margin was 14.9% in 2014 and 15.0% in 2013. The decrease resulted primarily from strategic growth investments offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $416 million and $290 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively (Note 4). Interest expense increased $218 million primarily due to the debt issued and assumed in connection with the acquisition of Life Technologies. In 2014, the company realized net gains of $9 million from equity and available-for-sale investments. In 2013, the company recorded $74 million of charges related to amortization of fees paid to obtain bridge financing commitments related to the acquisition of Life Technologies. Also in 2013, the company irrevocably contributed appreciated available-for-sale investments that had a fair value of $27 million to two of its U.K. defined benefit plans, resulting in realization of a previously unrecognized gain of $11 million. Provision for Income Taxes The company’s effective tax rates were 9.2% and 3.1% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The 2014 provision for income taxes includes $390 million related to gains on the sales of businesses. Aside from the discrete tax on the gains, the company had a benefit from income taxes primarily due to restructuring and other costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies as well as an increase in the expected benefit from foreign tax credits. In 2014, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $172 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $55 million on the related foreign income. The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $117 million and reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 5.6 percentage points in 2014. The federal tax credit for 2014 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2014 by $20.1 million, or 1.0 percentage point. In 2014, the company recognized a discrete tax benefit of $15.4 million, or 0.7 percentage points, attributable to tax rulings related to non-U.S. subsidiaries. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization, the company’s cash payments (net of refunds) for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $586 million and $230 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The effective tax rate in both periods was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in the 2014 period was favorably affected by $5.5 million, or 0.3 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates. The U.S. Congress has not extended the tax credit for research and development activities in 2015 as of February 26, 2015. Financial Statement Index 38 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) In 2013, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $160 million offset by additional U.S. income taxes of $56 million on the related foreign income. The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $104 million and reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 7.9 percentage points in 2013. In addition, the effective tax rate in 2013 was also reduced by the U.S. Congress’ renewal in January 2013 of a tax credit for research and development activities for 2012 and 2013 and, to a lesser extent, financing costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies that are deductible in the U.S. The federal tax credit for 2012 and 2013 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2013 by $15.4 million, or 1.2 percentage points. The tax provision in the 2013 period was unfavorably affected by $5.4 million, or 0.4 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates and audit settlements. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2015 will be less than 3% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. All of these countries except one have a lower tax rate than the U.S. The countries in which the company has a material presence that have significantly lower tax rates than the U.S. include Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate. Discontinued Operations In June 2012, in an effort to exit a non-core business, the company pursued a sale of its laboratory workstations business, part of the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The company completed the sale in October 2012 for nominal proceeds. In 2013, the company recorded an after-tax charge of $4.2 million for the estimated cost to raze certain abandoned facilities of the discontinued operations prior to the planned sale of the land. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2015, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify income statement classification by removing the concept of extraordinary items from U.S. GAAP. As a result, items that are both unusual and infrequent will no longer be separately reported net of tax after continuing operations. The company adopted this guidance effective January 2015. The adoption of this standard in 2015 is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued new revenue recognition guidance which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. The new standard also requires significantly expanded disclosures regarding the qualitative and quantitative information of an entity's nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The guidance is effective for the company in 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. The company is currently evaluating the impact the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. In April 2014, the FASB issued new guidance on reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations will be presented as discontinued operations. The new guidance also requires disclosure of the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of the company that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. The company adopted this guidance effective January 2015. The adoption of this standard in 2015 is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements.

An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the headings “Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters” and “Intellectual Property Matters” in Note 10 could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows. 2013 Compared With 2012 Continuing Operations Total Currency Acquisitions/ (In millions) 2013 2012 Change Translation Divestitures Operations Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $ 712.5 $ 658.8 $ 53.7 $ (1.1 ) $ — $ 54.8 Analytical Instruments 3,154.2 3,114.7 39.5 (23.2 ) 9.4 53.3 Specialty Diagnostics 3,191.7 2,961.5 230.2 (5.4 ) 143.0 92.6 Laboratory Products and Services 6,398.8 6,102.8 296.0 (5.7 ) 35.7 266.0 Eliminations (366.9 ) (327.9 ) (39.0 ) (1.0 ) — (38.0 ) Consolidated Revenues $ 13,090.3 $ 12,509.9 $ 580.4 $ (36.4 ) $ 188.1 $ 428.7 Sales in 2013 were $13.09 billion, an increase of $580 million from 2012. Sales increased $188 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $36 million in 2013. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $429 million (3%) primarily due to increased demand offset in part by modestly lower sales to customers in academic and government markets which the company believes was due in part to uncertainty in government funding expectations in the U.S. Sales remained strong to customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries while sales growth was modest to customers in industrial markets. Sales growth was strong in Asia and modest in Europe and North America. In 2013, total company operating income and operating income margin were $1.61 billion and 12.3%, respectively, compared with $1.48 billion and 11.8%, respectively, in 2012. The increase in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and, to a lesser extent, profit on incremental sales from acquisitions. The increase was offset in part by strategic growth investments, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and, to a lesser extent, $24 million of higher acquisition-related charges in 2013, an increase in amortization expense of $16 million in 2013 primarily related to the acquisitions of One Lambda and Doe & Ingalls and imposition of a medical device excise tax in 2013. In 2013, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $180 million, including $29 million of charges to cost of revenues related primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $74 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses consisting primarily of transaction costs related to the acquisition of Life Technologies, revisions of estimated contingent consideration for an acquisition and a charge associated with product liability litigation. The company incurred $78 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, such as the consolidation of several facilities in the U.S. and Europe (see Note 14). The cash costs also included $4 million of transaction expenses related to the agreement to sell its sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses (see Note 2). Financial Statement Index 40 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) In 2012, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $150 million, including $56 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and $13 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consisting of transaction costs related to the acquisition of One Lambda. The company incurred $67 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated. The company also recorded $15 million of non-cash expense, net, primarily for the impairment of intangible asset at several small business units and, to a lesser extent, real estate writedowns related to facility consolidations partially offset by a $6 million gain from the settlement of pre-acquisition litigation. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2012 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $85 million beginning in part in 2012 and to a greater extent in 2013, including $10 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $25 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $20 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $30 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Income from the company’s reportable segments increased 7% to $2.55 billion in 2013 due primarily to productivity improvements, net of inflationary costs increases, and, to a lesser extent, profit on incremental sales from acquisitions, offset in part by strategic growth investments and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Life Sciences Solutions (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 Change Revenues $ 712.5 $ 658.8 8 % Operating Income Margin 23.8 % 23.5 % 0.3pt Sales in the Life Sciences Solutions segment increased $54 million to $713 million in 2013. Sales increased $55 million (8%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses offset in part by a decrease of $1 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for bioscience products. Operating income margin was 23.8% in 2013 compared to 23.5% in 2012. Operating margin was favorably affected by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by strategic growth investments. Analytical Instruments (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 Change Revenues $ 3,154.2 $ 3,114.7 1 % Operating Income Margin 17.7 % 17.8 % (0.1)pt Sales in the Analytical Instruments segment increased $40 million to $3.15 billion in 2013. Sales increased $53 million (2%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $9 million due to acquisitions. These increases were offset in part by a decrease of $23 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments, offset in part by lower sales of chemical analysis products which the company believes were affected by macro economic conditions facing customers in industrial markets. Operating income margin was 17.7% in 2013 compared to 17.8% in 2012. Operating margin was unfavorably affected by strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable foreign currency exchange, offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. Specialty Diagnostics (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 Change Revenues $ 3,191.7 $ 2,961.5 8 % Operating Income Margin 27.1 % 25.6 % 1.5pt Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $230 million to $3.19 billion in 2013. Sales increased $143 million due to an acquisition and $93 million (3%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. These increases were offset in part by a decrease of $5 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand, particularly for clinical diagnostics products and, to a lesser extent, microbiology and allergy products in part as a result of strong flu and pollen seasons, partially offset by weakness from reduced healthcare utilization and lower sales of instruments to diagnostic laboratories due in part to lower healthcare reimbursement rates in the U.S. for anatomical pathology tests. Financial Statement Index 42 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Operating income margin was 27.1% in 2013 and 25.6% in 2012. The increase resulted from profit on incremental sales from an acquisition and, to a lesser extent, at existing businesses as well as productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. The increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments and imposition of the medical device excise tax in 2013. Laboratory Products and Services (Dollars in millions) 2013 2012 Change Revenues $ 6,398.8 $ 6,102.8 5 % Operating Income Margin 15.0 % 15.0 % 0.0pt Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $296 million to $6.40 billion in 2013. Sales increased $266 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $36 million due to an acquisition. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $6 million in 2013. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for laboratory products and clinical trial logistics services. Sales of laboratory equipment increased only modestly due to weakness in demand from customers in academic and government markets. Operating income margin was 15.0% in both 2013 and 2012. Productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, price increases were offset by strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix. Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $290 million and $213 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively (Note 4). In the first quarter of 2013, the company irrevocably contributed appreciated available-for-sale investments that had a fair value of $27 million to two of its U.K. defined benefit plans, resulting in realization of a previously unrecognized gain of $11 million. In 2013, other items, net also includes $74 million of charges related to amortization of fees paid to obtain bridge financing commitments related to the Life Technologies Acquisition, offset in part by gains totaling $5 million from sales of equity investments. Interest expense increased $21 million primarily due to the debt issued to fund the One Lambda and Life Technologies acquisitions. Provision for Income Taxes The company’s effective tax rates were 3.1% and 0.9% in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization, the company’s cash payments (net of refunds) for income taxes for its continuing operations were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $230 million and $331 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Tax payments decreased in 2013 due primarily to refunds of taxes paid in 2012. In 2013, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the U.S. which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $160 million offset by additional U.S. income taxes of $56 million on the related foreign income. The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $104 million and reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 7.9 percentage points in 2013. In addition, the effective tax rate in 2013 was also reduced by the U.S. Congress’ renewal in January 2013 of a tax credit for research and development activities for 2012 and 2013 and, to a lesser extent, increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions and financing costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies that are deductible in the U.S. The tax credit for 2012 and 2013 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2013 by $15.4 million, or 1.2 percentage points. The tax provision in the 2013 period was unfavorably affected by $5.4 million, or 0.4 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates and audit settlements. The tax provision in 2012 was favorably affected by $53 million, or 4.1 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, particularly a lower tax rate in Sweden. Financial Statement Index 43 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations (continued) Discontinued Operations The company completed the sale of its laboratory workstations business in October 2012 for nominal proceeds. The business was included in the Laboratory Products and Services segment prior to being reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented in June 2012. Revenues of the laboratory workstations business were $147 million in the 2012 period prior to the sale. The business incurred a pre-tax loss of $30 million in 2012 in part due to inventory write-offs, higher manufacturing costs and restructuring and other transition costs associated with relocation of the business. In 2012, the company recorded after-tax charges aggregating $63 million as the loss on the divestiture. The loss in 2013 for discontinued operations primarily represents a charge for the cost of razing abandoned facilities of the business prior to sale of the land. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $1.19 billion at December 31, 2014, compared with $6.75 billion at December 31, 2013. Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.35 billion at December 31, 2014 and $5.83 billion at December 31, 2013. The decrease in working capital is primarily due to the cash used to fund the Life Technologies acquisition and an increase in short-term debt of $1.2 billion, also principally due to the acquisition. 2014 Cash provided by operating activities was $2.62 billion during 2014, primarily from the company’s earnings. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $145 million and $110 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Other assets decreased by $163 million primarily due to collection of tax refunds including those related to legacy Life Technologies’ operations. Other liabilities increased by $308 million primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation and income taxes. In 2014, the company made cash payments including severance obligations, third-party transaction/integration costs and monetizing certain equity awards totaling $325 million related to the acquisition of Life Technologies. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $50 million during 2014. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $586 million during 2014, compared with $230 million in 2013, in part due to taxes on the gains from the sale of businesses. During 2014, the company’s investing activities used $11.78 billion of cash, principally for the acquisition of Life Technologies. Acquisitions used cash of $13.06 billion. Proceeds from the sale of businesses provided $1.52 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $428 million of property, plant and equipment. In February 2015, the company completed an acquisition for approximately $300 million in cash (Note 17). The company’s financing activities provided $4.80 billion of cash during 2014. To partially fund the acquisition of Life Technologies, the company borrowed $5.00 billion under an unsecured term loan (Note 9) and issued 34.9 million shares of its common stock for net proceeds of $2.94 billion in cash (Note 11). Other long-term borrowings totaled $1.59 billion. Repayments of long-term debt, principally the term loan, totaled $4.43 billion. A decrease in commercial paper obligations used cash of $250 million. The company’s financing activities also included $155 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises offset by the payment of $235 million in cash dividends. On November 8, 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.00 billion of the company’s common stock beginning January 1, 2013. At December 31, 2014, $910 million was available for future repurchases of the company’s common stock under this authorization. In the first quarter of 2015 through February 26, 2015, the company repurchased $500 million of its common stock under this authorization. In February 2015, the company notified holders of its 5.00% Senior Notes due June 2015 that it will redeem all $250 million principal amount outstanding on March 6, 2015. Financial Statement Index 44 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) As of December 31, 2014, the company’s short-term debt totaled $2.21 billion, including $1.21 billion of senior notes, due in the first half of 2015 and $1.00 billion of minimum payments due in the next twelve months on the company’s term loan. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. In February 2015, the maximum capacity of this facility was increased from $1.50 billion to $2.00 billion. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $59 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the U.S. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. foreign tax credit equals or exceeds any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and short-term investments of $1.35 billion as of December 31, 2014 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2013 Cash provided by operating activities was $2.01 billion during 2013, primarily from the company’s earnings. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $148 million and $72 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. A decrease in other assets provided cash of $169 million primarily due to timing of income tax refunds. An increase in accounts payable provided cash of $47 million, primarily due to higher inventory purchases. An increase in other liabilities provided cash of $163 million primarily due to the timing of payments for income taxes and incentive compensation. In the 2013, the company paid fees to obtain bridge financing commitments and other transaction costs totaling $108 million related to the acquisition of Life Technologies. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $38 million during 2013. Cash payments for income taxes of continuing operations totaled $230 million. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $69 million during 2013. During 2013, the company’s primary investing activity was the purchase of $282 million of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities provided $3.31 billion of cash during 2013. To partially fund the acquisition of Life Technologies, the company issued $3.20 billion of senior notes. The company’s financing activities also included the receipt of $230 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises offset by the repurchase of $90 million of the company’s common stock and the payment of $216 million in cash dividends. Financial Statement Index 45 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) 2012 Cash provided by operating activities was $2.04 billion during 2012, primarily from the company’s earnings. An increase in inventories used cash of $60 million, primarily to support growth in sales. An increase in other assets used cash of $100 million primarily related to the timing of tax refunds. An increase in other liabilities provided cash of $127 million, primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation and income taxes. Cash payments for income taxes of continuing operations totaled $331 million during 2012. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $64 million during 2012. During 2012, the company’s primary investing activities included acquisitions and the purchase of property, plant and equipment. The company expended $1.08 billion for acquisitions and $315 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The company’s investing activities also included a $45 million increase in restricted cash to collateralize short-term borrowings in Asia. The company’s discontinued operations provided $59 million of cash, primarily tax benefits from the loss on sale of the laboratory workstations business and receipt of escrowed proceeds from the 2011 sale of Lancaster Laboratories. The company’s financing activities used $918 million of cash during 2012, principally for the repurchase of $1.15 billion of the company’s common stock and to reduce commercial paper obligations by $849 million, offset in part by the issuance of $1.3 billion in senior notes. The company’s financing activities in 2012 also included the repayment of $355 million of long-term debt and the receipt of $254 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Cash dividend payments totaled $142 million during 2012. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The company did not use special purpose entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2012 - 2014 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, a build-to-suit lease arrangement entered in 2012, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table or discussed below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $32.1 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the company’s own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business. Financial Statement Index 46 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the company’s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2014.

(b) Unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty. (c) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company. Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $214 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, other than those included in the above table, but expects that for 2015, such expenditures will approximate $450 to $470 million. A guarantee of residual value under a build-to-suit lease arrangement for a facility that was leased upon completion of construction has not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantee may require payment. Upon completion of construction in 2014, a five-year lease commenced with options to purchase the facility or renew the lease for up to three 5-year terms. The residual value guarantee becomes operative at the end of the lease for up to a maximum of $58 million. Financial Statement Index 47 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued) A guarantee of pension plan obligations of a divested business has not been included in the preceding table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantee may require payment. The purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits, however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so. The amount of the guarantee at December 31, 2014 was $49 million. In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and related legal fees. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows. The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business – Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Japanese yen, Norwegian kroner and Swedish kronor. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements. Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2014, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2014 was $14.89 billion (see Note 12). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2014 would increase by approximately $683 million. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2014 would decrease by approximately $629 million. In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including a term loan agreement and swap arrangements. In 2014, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the term loan and swap arrangements would have increased the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $35 million. Financial Statement Index 48 Table of Contents THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued) Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in British pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, euro, Danish kroner and Canadian dollars. The effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2014 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $1.04 billion. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2014 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $110 million. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2014 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $110 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged. Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2014 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $23 million on the company’s net income.",2023-12-30 17:37:52.036812
97745,TMO,THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.,2016,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsReference is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report.OverviewThe company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s continuing operations fall into four business segments (see Note 3): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services.Recent Acquisitions and DivestituresThe company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. The company’s principal recent acquisitions and divestitures are described below.On February 3, 2014, the company completed the acquisition of Life Technologies Corporation for a total purchase price of $15.30 billion, net of cash acquired, including the assumption of $2.28 billion of debt. The company issued debt and common stock in late 2013 and early 2014 to partially fund the acquisition discussed below under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources”. Life Technologies was integrated into the Life Sciences Solutions segment and provides innovative products and services to customers conducting scientific research and genetic analysis, as well as those in applied markets, such as forensics and food safety testing. Life Technologies’ revenues totaled $3.87 billion in 2013.On March 21, 2014, the company sold its legacy sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses to GE Healthcare for $1.06 billion, net of cash divested. The sale of these businesses resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $761 million included in restructuring and other costs (income), net. The businesses fell principally in the Life Sciences Solutions segment. Divestiture of these businesses was a condition to obtaining antitrust approval for the Life Technologies acquisition. Revenues and operating income of the businesses sold were approximately $250 million and $64 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $61 million and $12 million, respectively, in 2014 through the date of sale.On August 15, 2014, the company sold its Cole-Parmer specialty channel business, part of the Laboratory Products and Services segment, for $480 million in cash, net of cash divested. The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $134 million, included in restructuring and other costs (income), net. Revenues and operating income of the business sold were approximately $232 million and $43 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $149 million and $28 million, respectively, in 2014 through the date of sale.On February 4, 2015, the company acquired Advanced Scientifics, Inc., a North America-based global provider of single-use technologies for customized bioprocessing solutions, for approximately $289 million. Advanced Scientifics was integrated into the Life Sciences Solutions segment and expands the company’s bioprocessing offerings. Revenues of Advanced Scientifics were approximately $80 million in 2014.On September 30, 2015, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Alfa Aesar, a U.K.-based global manufacturer of research chemicals from Johnson Matthey Plc, for £257 million ($392 million) in cash. The acquisition expands the company’s existing portfolio of chemicals, solvents and reagents. Revenues of Alfa Aesar were approximately £78 million in 2014.In January 2016, the company signed an agreement to acquire, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Affymetrix, Inc., a North America-based provider of cellular and genetic analysis products, for approximately $1.3 billion in cash. The acquisition will expand the company's existing portfolio of antibodies and assays for high-growth flow cytometry and single-cell biology applications. Revenues of Affymetrix were $360 million in 2015. The transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2016, is subject to the approval of Affymetrix shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. The company expects to issue debt in advance of closing the acquisition of Affymetrix to partially fund the acquisition.23THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of Results of Operations and Liquidity(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $4,439.4 26.2 % $4,195.7 24.8 %Analytical Instruments 3,208.2 18.9 % 3,252.2 19.3 %Specialty Diagnostics 3,243.9 19.1 % 3,343.6 19.8 %Laboratory Products and Services 6,661.5 39.3 % 6,601.5 39.1 %Eliminations (587.6) (3.5)% (503.4) (3.0)% $16,965.4 100 % $16,889.6 100 %Sales in 2015 were $16.97 billion, an increase of $76 million from 2014. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $938 million in 2015. Sales increased $212 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures, revenues increased $803 million (5%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales to customers in the company’s primary end markets grew. Demand from customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries was particularly strong, while sales to industrial markets and academic and government markets grew modestly in 2015. Sales growth was moderate in North America and Europe and strong in Asia. Revenues and operating income of the company’s non-U.S. operations are translated into U.S. dollars to report consolidated results. Based on weakening of currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar that occurred in 2015 and early 2016, the company currently expects that there will be a continued adverse effect on reported amounts of revenues and operating income in 2016 as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar.In 2015, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.34 billion and 13.8%, respectively, compared with $2.50 billion and 14.8%, respectively, in 2014. The decrease in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to net gains of $895 million on the sale of businesses in 2014, offset in part by $450 million of charges in 2014 associated with the February 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange also contributed to the decrease in profitability. These factors that reduced operating income in 2015 were offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, profit on higher sales in local currencies. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. The company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2015. In 2015, the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries. These initiatives resulted in additional foreign tax credits of $111 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $46 million on the related foreign income (net benefit of $66 million), which reduced the company’s effective rate by 3.4 percentage points. The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $80 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. In addition, the company recorded tax benefits totaling $54 million, or 2.8 percentage points, related to additional prior year foreign tax and other credits as well as restructuring and other costs associated with the 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies. The tax provision in the 2015 period was favorably affected by $37 million, or 1.9 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates. The effective tax rate in both 2015 and 2014 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $477 million and $586 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.The company’s effective tax rate was 9.2% in 2014. The 2014 provision for income taxes included $390 million related to gains on the sales of businesses. Aside from the discrete tax on the gains, the company had a benefit from income taxes primarily due to restructuring and other costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies as well as an increase in the expected benefit from foreign tax credits. In 2014, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $172 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $55 million on the related foreign income. The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $117 million and reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 5.6 percentage points in 2014. The federal tax credit for 2014 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2014 by $20 million, or 1.0 percentage point. In 2014, the company recognized a discrete 24THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued)tax benefit of $15 million, or 0.7 percentage points, attributable to tax rulings related to non-U.S. subsidiaries. The tax provision in the 2014 period was favorably affected by $5.5 million, or 0.3 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2016 will be less than 3% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. Income from continuing operations increased to $1.98 billion in 2015, from $1.90 billion in 2014. The decrease in operating income in the 2015 period (discussed above) was more than offset by an increase in the income tax benefit in the 2015 period (discussed above) and a decrease in interest expense of $65 million primarily due to a reduction in outstanding debt and effective interest rates.During 2015, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $2.82 billion compared with $2.62 billion for 2014. The increase resulted from cash disbursements in the 2014 period totaling $325 million related to the acquisition of Life Technologies, including severance obligations, third-party transaction/integration costs and monetizing certain equity awards held by Life Technologies employees at the date of acquisition, offset in part by lower payments in 2014 for incentive compensation as a result of Life Technologies having paid its annual incentive compensation prior to the acquisition.As of December 31, 2015, the company’s short-term debt totaled $1.05 billion, including $1.00 billion of senior notes, due in the next twelve months and $50 million of commercial paper obligations. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2015, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $65 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $452 million as of December 31, 2015 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, sales returns, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, and pension costs. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:(a)Accounts ReceivableThe company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such allowances totaled $70 million at December 31, 2015. The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required.(b)InventoriesThe company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, 25THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required.(c)Intangible Assets and GoodwillThe company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $11.51 billion at December 31, 2015. The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $18.83 billion and $1.25 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2015. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.Projections of profitability for 2016 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2015, the date of the company’s impairment testing. There can be no assurance, however, that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary.(d)RevenuesIn instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative selling price at the time of sale. Should the relative value of either the equipment or the installation change, the company’s revenue recognition would be affected.In instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing.The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required.(e)Income TaxesIn the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest 26THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. The company’s reserve for these matters totaled $350 million at December 31, 2015. Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes.The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income.The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit, based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $109 million at December 31, 2015. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary.The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the company’s tax provision would result.(f)Contingencies and LitigationThe company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Accruals of acquired businesses, including product liability and environmental accruals, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.(g)Pension and Other Retiree BenefitsSeveral of the company’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $29 million in 2015. The company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $528 million at year-end 2015 compared with $540 million at year-end 2014. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $102 million.As of December 31, 2015, the company expects to contribute between $30 and $50 million to its existing defined benefit pension plans in 2016.27THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations2015 Compared With 2014 Continuing Operations(In millions) 2015 2014 TotalChange CurrencyTranslation Acquisitions/Divestitures Operations Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $4,439.4 $4,195.7 $243.7 $(263.8) $305.9 $201.6Analytical Instruments 3,208.2 3,252.2 (44.0) (188.8) 4.1 140.7Specialty Diagnostics 3,243.9 3,343.6 (99.7) (196.6) 10.8 86.1Laboratory Products and Services 6,661.5 6,601.5 60.0 (302.9) (101.9) 464.8Eliminations (587.6) (503.4) (84.2) 13.8 (7.4) (90.6) Consolidated Revenues $16,965.4 $16,889.6 $75.8 $(938.3) $211.5 $802.6Sales in 2015 were $16.97 billion, an increase of $76 million from 2014. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $938 million in 2015. Sales increased $212 million due to acquisitions, principally Life Technologies, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions/divestitures, revenues increased $803 million (5%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales to customers in the company’s primary end markets grew. Demand from customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries was particularly strong. Sales growth was moderate in North America and Europe and strong in Asia.In 2015, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.34 billion and 13.8%, respectively, compared with $2.50 billion and 14.8%, respectively, in 2014. The decrease in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to net gains of $895 million on the sale of businesses in 2014, offset in part by $450 million of charges in 2014 associated with the February 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange also contributed to the decrease in profitability. These factors that reduced operating income in 2015 were offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, profit on higher sales in local currencies. In 2015, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $171 million, including $9 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation; $46 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for charges associated with product liability litigation, third-party transaction and integration costs primarily related to the acquisitions of Life Technologies and Alfa Aesar, and accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation. In addition, the company recorded $82 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for actions to achieve synergies from the Life Technologies acquisition and for abandoned facilities costs associated with a manufacturing facility in the U.S. The company’s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, including the consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The company also recorded charges for litigation-related matters associated with acquired businesses and impairment of acquired technology in development. These costs were partially offset by gains on the sale of a small product line and real estate (see Note 14).In 2014, the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $140 million, including net gains on the sale of businesses and real estate of $895 million and $15 million, respectively, offset in part by $328 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition; $131 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for transaction costs related to the acquisition of Life Technologies; and $29 million of charges for pension settlements. The company incurred $268 million of cash restructuring costs primarily associated with the Life Technologies acquisition including cash compensation to monetize certain equity awards held by Life Technologies employees at the date of acquisition and severance obligations to former executives and employees of Life Technologies. In addition, the company’s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that 28THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)have been or are being consolidated, including the consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia.As of February 25, 2016, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $55 million in 2016 and expects to identify additional actions during 2016 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as abandonment of leased facilities. Approximately 70% of the additional charges will be incurred in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, with the remainder incurred across the company’s remaining segments. The restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2015 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $100 million beginning in part in 2015 and, to a greater extent, in 2016, including $50 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $25 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $10 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $15 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2014 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $120 million beginning in part in 2014 and to a greater extent in 2015, including $80 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $10 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $10 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $20 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.Segment ResultsThe company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.

Had the acquisition of Life Technologies been completed at the beginning of 2013, revenues for the 2015 period would have decreased $25 million compared to pro forma 2014 revenues, including a decrease of $278 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation, offset in part by an increase of $213 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and an increase of $40 million due to other acquisitions, net of dispositions. The increase in pro forma revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for bioprocess production products as well as biosciences products.Operating income margin was 30.1% in 2015 compared to 29.0% in 2014. The increase resulted primarily from productivity improvements (including acquisition cost synergies), net of inflationary cost increases and favorable sales mix. These increases were offset in part by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange and, to a lesser extent, by exclusion in 2014 of January’s lower margin results for Life Technologies. Results for January commonly have a lower margin rate than results for the balance of the quarter, due to the phasing of revenue and costs.Analytical Instruments(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 Change Revenues $3,208.2 $3,252.2 (1)% Operating Income Margin 19.1% 17.9% 1.2 ptSales in the Analytical Instruments segment decreased $44 million to $3.21 billion in 2015. Sales decreased $189 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation, offset in part by increases of $141 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $4 million due to acquisitions. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for chromatography products and, to a lesser extent, sales of service offerings and increased demand for mass spectrometry instruments. These increases were offset in part by modestly lower sales of chemical analysis products due primarily to softness in certain commodity materials markets.Operating income margin was 19.1% in 2015 compared to 17.9% in 2014. The increase resulted primarily from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and profit on incremental sales in local currencies, offset in part by strategic growth investments and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange.Specialty Diagnostics(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 Change Revenues $3,243.9 $3,343.6 (3)% Operating Income Margin 26.9% 27.4% -0.5 ptSales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment decreased $100 million to $3.24 billion in 2015. Sales decreased $197 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation offset in part by $86 million (3%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $11 million due to an acquisition net of a divestiture. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for clinical diagnostics products, products sold through the segment’s healthcare market 30THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)channel and immunodiagnostics products. These increases were offset in part by lower sales due to the expiration, in late 2014, of an OEM contract following the acquisition of the customer by a competitor.Operating income margin was 26.9% in 2015 and 27.4% in 2014. The decrease resulted primarily from strategic growth investments and unfavorable foreign currency exchange, offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.Laboratory Products and Services(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 Change Revenues $6,661.5 $6,601.5 1% Operating Income Margin 15.0% 14.9% 0.1 ptSales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $60 million to $6.66 billion in 2015. Sales increased $465 million (7%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. This increase was offset in part by $303 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation and $102 million due to a disposition, net of an acquisition. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for products in each of the segment’s principal businesses.Operating income margin was 15.0% in 2015 and 14.9% in 2014. The increase was primarily due to productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases as well as profit on incremental sales in local currencies offset in part by unfavorable sales mix and strategic growth investments.Other Expense, NetThe company reported other expense, net, of $400 million and $416 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively (Note 4). Interest expense decreased $65 million primarily due to a reduction in outstanding debt and effective interest rates. In 2015, other items, net includes losses of $12 million on the early extinguishment of debt and costs of $7.5 million associated with entering into interest rate swap arrangements. In 2014, other items, net includes net gains of $9 million on the sale of investments. Provision for Income TaxesThe company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2015. In 2015, the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries. These initiatives resulted in additional foreign tax credits of $111 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $46 million on the related foreign income (net benefit of $66 million), which reduced the company’s effective rate by 3.4 percentage points. The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $80 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. In addition, the company recorded tax benefits totaling $54 million, or 2.8 percentage points, related to additional prior year foreign tax and other credits as well as restructuring and other costs associated with the 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies. The tax provision in the 2015 period was favorably affected by $37 million, or 1.9 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates. The effective tax rate in both 2015 and 2014 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $477 million and $586 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.The company’s effective tax rate was 9.2% in 2014. The 2014 provision for income taxes included $390 million related to gains on the sales of businesses. Aside from the discrete tax on the gains, the company had a benefit from income taxes primarily due to restructuring and other costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies as well as an increase in the expected benefit from foreign tax credits. In 2014, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $172 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $55 million on the related foreign income. The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $117 million and reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 5.6 percentage points in 2014. The federal tax credit for 2014 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2014 by $20 million, or 1.0 percentage point. In 2014, the company recognized a discrete tax benefit of $15 million, or 0.7 percentage points, attributable to tax rulings related to non-U.S. subsidiaries. The tax provision in the 2014 period was favorably affected by $5.5 million, or 0.3 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates.31THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)The company expects its effective tax rate in 2016 will be less than 3% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits.The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. All of these countries except one have a lower tax rate than the U.S. The countries in which the company has a material presence that have significantly lower tax rates than the U.S. include Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate.Recent Accounting PronouncementsA description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1.Contingent LiabilitiesThe company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the headings “Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters"" and ""Intellectual Property Matters"" in Note 10 could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.2014 Compared With 2013 Continuing Operations(In millions) 2014 2013 TotalChange CurrencyTranslation Acquisitions/Divestitures Operations Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $4,195.7 $712.5 $3,483.2 $(0.2) $3,446.2 $37.2Analytical Instruments 3,252.2 3,154.2 98.0 (29.9) 15.3 112.6Specialty Diagnostics 3,343.6 3,191.7 151.9 (12.4) 10.1 154.2Laboratory Products and Services 6,601.5 6,398.8 202.7 (16.9) (92.5) 312.1Eliminations (503.4) (366.9) (136.5) (0.3) (69.3) (66.9) Consolidated Revenues $16,889.6 $13,090.3 $3,799.3 $(59.7) $3,309.8 $549.2Sales in 2014 were $16.89 billion, an increase of $3.80 billion from 2013. Sales increased $3.31 billion due to acquisitions, net of divestitures. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $60 million in 2014. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions/divestitures, revenues increased $549 million (4%) primarily due to increased demand. Demand from biopharma customers remained strong. Sales to customers in healthcare and industrial markets grew moderately while sales to academic and government markets grew modestly in 2014. Sales growth was strong in Europe and moderate in North America and Asia.In 2014, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.50 billion and 14.8%, respectively, compared with $1.61 billion and 12.3%, respectively, in 2013. The increase in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to net gains of $895 million on the sale of businesses, inclusion of Life Technologies’ results from the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. These increases were offset in part by $450 million of charges associated with the acquisition, as discussed below, as well as $569 million of higher amortization expenses, also primarily related to the acquisition.In 2014, the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $140 million, including net gains on the sale of businesses and real estate of $895 million and $15 million, respectively, offset in part by $328 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition; $131 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for transaction costs related to the acquisition of Life Technologies; and $29 million of charges for pension settlements. The company incurred $268 million of cash restructuring costs primarily associated with the 32THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)Life Technologies acquisition including cash compensation to monetize certain equity awards held by Life Technologies employees at the date of acquisition and severance obligations to former executives and employees of Life Technologies. In addition, the company’s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, including the consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia (see Note 14). In 2013, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $180 million, including $29 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $74 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consisting of transaction costs related to the acquisition of Life Technologies, changes in estimates of contingent consideration for an acquisition and a charge associated with product liability litigation. The company incurred $78 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that were being consolidated. The cash costs also included $4 million of transaction expenses related to the agreement to sell its sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses (see Note 2).The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2013 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $80 million beginning in part in 2013 and to a greater extent in 2014, including $5 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $30 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $20 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $25 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.Segment Results(Dollars in millions) 2014 2013 Change Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $4,195.7 $712.5 489%Analytical Instruments 3,252.2 3,154.2 3%Specialty Diagnostics 3,343.6 3,191.7 5%Laboratory Products and Services 6,601.5 6,398.8 3%Eliminations (503.4) (366.9) 37% Consolidated Revenues $16,889.6 $13,090.3 29% Segment Income Life Sciences Solutions $1,214.9 $169.7 616%Analytical Instruments 581.1 558.7 4%Specialty Diagnostics 916.0 863.7 6%Laboratory Products and Services 982.8 960.4 2% Subtotal Reportable Segments 3,694.8 2,552.5 45% Cost of Revenues Charges (327.6) (28.6) Selling, General and Administrative Costs, Net (130.7) (73.5) Restructuring and Other Income (Costs), Net 598.2 (77.7) Amortization of Acquisition-related Intangible Assets (1,331.7) (763.1) Consolidated Operating Income $2,503.0 $1,609.6 56% Reportable Segments Operating Income Margin 21.9% 19.5% Consolidated Operating Income Margin 14.8% 12.3% 33THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)Income from the company’s reportable segments increased 45% to $3.69 billion in 2014 due primarily to the acquisition of Life Technologies and to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary costs increases, offset in part by strategic growth investments.Life Sciences Solutions(Dollars in millions) 2014 2013 Change Revenues $4,195.7 $712.5 489% Operating Income Margin 29.0% 23.8% 5.2ptSales in the Life Sciences Solutions segment increased $3.48 billion to $4.20 billion in 2014 primarily due to the acquisition of Life Technologies, net of divestitures. Had the acquisition of Life Technologies been completed at the beginning of 2013, pro forma revenues for the 2014 period would have decreased $38 million compared to pro forma 2013 revenues, including a decrease of $151 million due to dispositions, net of other acquisitions and a decrease of $45 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation, offset in part by an increase of $158 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The increase in pro forma revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for biosciences and bioprocess production products, offset in part by lower licensing revenues.Operating income margin was 29.0% in 2014 compared to 23.8% in 2013. The increase resulted primarily from higher operating margins in Life Technologies’ businesses relative to the segment’s legacy operations and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.Analytical Instruments(Dollars in millions) 2014 2013 Change Revenues $3,252.2 $3,154.2 3% Operating Income Margin 17.9% 17.7% 0.2ptSales in the Analytical Instruments segment increased $98 million to $3.25 billion in 2014.

The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for laboratory products and, to a lesser extent, clinical trial logistics services.Operating income margin was 14.9% in 2014 and 15.0% in 2013. The decrease resulted primarily from strategic growth investments offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.Other Expense, NetThe company reported other expense, net, of $416 million and $290 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively (Note 4). Interest expense increased $218 million primarily due to the debt issued and assumed in connection with the acquisition of Life Technologies. In 2014, the company realized net gains of $9 million from equity and available-for-sale investments. In 2013, the company recorded $74 million of charges related to amortization of fees paid to obtain bridge financing commitments related to the acquisition of Life Technologies. Also in 2013, the company irrevocably contributed appreciated available-for-sale investments that had a fair value of $27 million to two of its U.K. defined benefit plans, resulting in realization of a previously unrecognized gain of $11 million.Provision for Income TaxesThe company’s effective tax rates were 9.2% and 3.1% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The 2014 provision for income taxes includes $390 million related to gains on the sales of businesses. Aside from the discrete tax on the gains, the company had a benefit from income taxes primarily due to restructuring and other costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies as well as an increase in the expected benefit from foreign tax credits. In 2014, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $172 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $55 million on the related foreign income. The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $117 million and reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 5.6 percentage points in 2014. The federal tax credit for 2014 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2014 by $20 million, or 1.0 percentage point. In 2014, the company recognized a discrete tax benefit of $15 million, or 0.7 percentage points, attributable to tax rulings related to non-U.S. subsidiaries. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization, the company’s cash payments (net of refunds) for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $586 million and $230 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The effective tax rate in both periods was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. The tax provision in the 2014 period was favorably affected by $5.5 million, or 0.3 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates.In 2013, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $160 million offset by additional U.S. income taxes of $56 million on the related foreign income. The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $104 million and reduced the company’s effective tax rate by 7.9 percentage points in 2013. In addition, the effective tax rate in 2013 was also reduced by the U.S. Congress’ renewal in January 2013 of a tax credit for research and development activities for 2012 and 2013 and, to a lesser extent, financing costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies that are deductible in the U.S. The federal tax credit for 2012 and 2013 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2013 by $15 million, or 1.2 percentage points. The tax provision in the 2013 period was unfavorably affected by $5 million, or 0.4 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates and audit settlements.35THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital ResourcesConsolidated working capital was $1.59 billion at December 31, 2015, compared with $1.19 billion at December 31, 2014. Included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $452 million at December 31, 2015 and $1.34 billion at December 31, 2014. The increase in working capital is primarily due to a decrease in current debt offset in part by lower cash balances.2015 Cash provided by operating activities was $2.82 billion during 2015. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $149 million and $141 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales in local currencies. An increase in other assets used cash of $254 million primarily related to the timing of tax payments/refunds. An increase in other liabilities provided cash of $148 million primarily due to the timing of payments for income taxes and incentive compensation. Cash payments for income taxes decreased to $477 million during 2015, compared with $586 million in 2014 that included taxes associated with gains on divestitures. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $38 million during 2015. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $97 million during 2015.During 2015, the company’s investing activities used $1.09 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $695 million. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $423 million of property, plant and equipment. In January 2016, the company announced an agreement to acquire Affymetrix for approximately $1.3 billion in cash. The transaction, which is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2016, is subject to the approval of Affymetrix shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals. The company expects to issue debt in advance of closing the acquisition of Affymetrix to partially fund the acquisition.The company’s financing activities used $2.49 billion of cash during 2015. Repayments of long-term debt totaled $3.78 billion. Issuance of senior notes provided cash of $1.80 billion and an increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $50 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $500 million of the company’s common stock and the payment of $241 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $124 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises. On November 12, 2015, the Board of Directors replaced the existing repurchase authorization with a new authorization to repurchase up to $1.00 billion of the company’s common stock. At December 31, 2015, $1.00 billion was available for future repurchases of the company’s common stock under this authorization. In the first quarter of 2016 through February 25, 2016, the company repurchased $500 million of its common stock under this authorization.As of December 31, 2015, the company’s short-term debt totaled $1.05 billion, including $1.00 billion of senior notes, due in the next twelve months and $50 million of commercial paper obligations. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2015, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $65 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the U.S. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. foreign tax credit equals or exceeds any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future.The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $452 million as of December 31, 2015 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.2014 Cash provided by operating activities was $2.62 billion during 2014 primarily from the company’s earnings. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $145 million and $110 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Other assets decreased by $163 million primarily due to collection of tax refunds including those related to legacy Life Technologies’ operations. Other liabilities increased by $308 million primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation and income taxes. In 2014, the company made cash payments including monetizing certain equity awards, 36THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)severance obligations and transaction costs totaling $325 million related to the acquisition of Life Technologies. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $50 million during 2014. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $586 million. During 2014, the company’s investing activities used $11.78 billion of cash, principally for the acquisition of Life Technologies. Acquisitions used cash of $13.06 billion. Proceeds from the sale of businesses provided $1.52 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $428 million of property, plant and equipment.The company’s financing activities provided $4.80 billion of cash during 2014. To partially fund the acquisition of Life Technologies, the company borrowed $5.00 billion under an unsecured term loan and issued 34.9 million shares of its common stock for net proceeds of $2.94 billion in cash (Note 11). Other long-term borrowings totaled $1.59 billion. Repayments of long-term debt, principally the term loan, totaled $4.43 billion. A decrease in commercial paper obligations used cash of $250 million. The company’s financing activities also included the receipt of $155 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises offset by the payment of $235 million in cash dividends.2013Cash provided by operating activities was $2.01 billion during 2013, primarily from the company’s earnings. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $148 million and $72 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. A decrease in other assets provided cash of $169 million primarily due to timing of income tax refunds. An increase in accounts payable provided cash of $47 million, primarily due to higher inventory purchases. An increase in other liabilities provided cash of $163 million primarily due to the timing of payments for income taxes and incentive compensation. In the 2013, the company paid fees to obtain bridge financing commitments and other transaction costs totaling $108 million related to the acquisition of Life Technologies. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $38 million during 2013. Cash payments for income taxes of continuing operations totaled $230 million. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $69 million during 2013.During 2013, the company’s primary investing activity was the purchase of $282 million of property, plant and equipment.The company’s financing activities provided $3.31 billion of cash during 2013.

The company’s financing activities also included the receipt of $230 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises offset by the repurchase of $90 million of the company’s common stock and the payment of $216 million in cash dividends.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe company did not use special purpose entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2013 - 2015 except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, residual value guarantees under two lease agreements, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table or discussed below. Of the amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees, $18 million relates to guarantees of the performance of third parties, principally in connection with businesses that were sold. The balance relates to guarantees of the company’s own performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business.37THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial CommitmentsThe table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the company’s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2015.

Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty.(c)Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company.Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $350 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions.The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, other than those included in the above table, but expects that for 2016, such expenditures will approximate $415 to $430 million.Guarantees of residual value under lease arrangements for two facilities have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantees may require payment (see Note 10). The residual value guarantees become operative at the end of the leases for up to a maximum of $111 million. The initial terms of these leases end in 2019 and 2020, although renewal options exist for each.A guarantee of pension plan obligations of a divested business has not been included in the preceding table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantee may require payment. The purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits, however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so. The amount of the guarantee at December 31, 2015 was $41 million.In January 2016, the company committed to acquire Affymetrix for approximately $1.3 billion (see Note 16). In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and related legal fees. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to 38THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows.The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business – Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, Norwegian kroner, and Swedish kronor. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements.Interest RatesThe company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2015, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2015 was $12.68 billion (see Note 12). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2015 would increase by approximately $630 million. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2015 would decrease by approximately $581 million.In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. In 2015, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the swap arrangements would have increased the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $33 million.Currency Exchange RatesThe company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in British pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, euro, Danish kroner and Canadian dollars. The effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2015 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $1.11 billion.The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2015 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $6 million. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2015 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $9 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2015 non-39THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued)functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $18 million on the company’s net income.",2023-12-30 17:37:58.819357
97745,TMO,THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.,2017,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsReference is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report.OverviewThe company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s continuing operations fall into four business segments (see Note 3): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services. Recent Acquisitions and DivestituresThe company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. The company’s principal recent acquisitions and divestitures are described below.On February 3, 2014, the company completed the acquisition of Life Technologies Corporation for a total purchase price of $15.30 billion, net of cash acquired, including the assumption of $2.28 billion of debt. The company issued debt and common stock in late 2013 and early 2014 to partially fund the acquisition discussed below under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources”. Life Technologies was integrated into the Life Sciences Solutions segment and provides innovative products and services to customers conducting scientific research and genetic analysis, as well as those in applied markets, such as forensics and food safety testing. Life Technologies’ revenues totaled $3.87 billion in 2013.On March 21, 2014, the company sold its legacy sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses to GE Healthcare for $1.06 billion, net of cash divested. The sale of these businesses resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $761 million included in restructuring and other costs (income), net. The businesses fell principally in the Life Sciences Solutions segment. Divestiture of these businesses was a condition to obtaining antitrust approval for the Life Technologies acquisition. Revenues and operating income of the businesses sold were approximately $250 million and $64 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $61 million and $12 million, respectively, in 2014 through the date of sale.On August 15, 2014, the company sold its Cole-Parmer specialty channel business, part of the Laboratory Products and Services segment, for $480 million in cash, net of cash divested. The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $134 million, included in restructuring and other costs (income), net. Revenues and operating income of the business sold were approximately $232 million and $43 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $149 million and $28 million, respectively, in 2014 through the date of sale.In February 2015, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Advanced Scientifics, Inc., a North America-based global provider of single-use systems and process equipment for bioprocess production, for approximately $289 million. The acquisition expanded the company’s bioprocessing offerings. Revenues of Advanced Scientifics were approximately $80 million in 2014.On September 30, 2015, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Alfa Aesar, a U.K.-based global manufacturer of research chemicals from Johnson Matthey Plc, for £257 million ($393 million) in cash. The acquisition expanded the company’s existing portfolio of chemicals, solvents and reagents. Revenues of Alfa Aesar were approximately £78 million in 2014. On March 31, 2016, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Affymetrix, Inc., a North America-based provider of cellular and genetic analysis products, for a total purchase price of $1.34 billion, net of cash acquired, including the assumption of $254 million of debt. The acquisition expanded the company's existing portfolio of antibodies and assays for flow cytometry and single-cell biology applications. Additionally, the acquisition expanded the company's genetic analysis portfolio through the addition of microarrays. Revenues of Affymetrix were $360 million in 2015. On September 19, 2016, the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, FEI Company, a North America-based provider of high-performance electron microscopy, for a total purchase price of $4.08 billion, net of cash acquired. The acquisition strengthened the company's analytical instrument portfolio with the addition of high-end electron microscopes. Revenues of FEI were $930 million in 2015. 23THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of Results of Operations and Liquidity(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $4,978.1 27.2 % $4,439.4 26.2 %Analytical Instruments 3,668.2 20.1 % 3,208.2 18.9 %Specialty Diagnostics 3,339.2 18.3 % 3,243.9 19.1 %Laboratory Products and Services 7,030.0 38.5 % 6,661.5 39.3 %Eliminations (741.4) (4.1)% (587.6) (3.5)% $18,274.1 100 % $16,965.4 100 %Sales in 2016 were $18.27 billion, an increase of $1.31 billion from 2015. Sales increased $733 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $145 million in 2016. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $721 million (4%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales to customers in the company’s primary end markets grew. Demand from customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries was particularly strong. Sales growth was strong in Asia, moderate in Europe and modest in North America. Based on the weakening of currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar that occurred in 2016, the company currently expects that there will be a continued adverse effect on reported amounts of revenue and operating income in 2017 as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar. In 2016, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.45 billion and 13.4%, respectively, compared with $2.34 billion and 13.8%, respectively, in 2015. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales in local currencies, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and, to a lesser extent, acquisitions. These increases were offset in part by higher restructuring and acquisition-related charges in the 2016 period, strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. The company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2016. In 2016, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $91 million, offset in part by additional U.S. taxes of $37 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2016) for a net benefit of $54 million. The foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. The company intends to make similar types of distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries when they can be made at no net tax cost. The ability of the company to make distributions in future periods of similar type and magnitude will depend on the level of earnings and cash flow in various foreign jurisdictions and on the applicable tax laws in effect at that time. Accordingly, the impact of foreign tax credits on the company’s effective tax rate in future periods is likely to vary. The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $100 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. In addition, the company recorded discrete benefits in 2016 totaling $39 million related to prior year tax filings and net charges of $12 million related to tax audits. The company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2015. In 2015, the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $111 million, offset in part by additional U.S. taxes of $46 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2015) for a net benefit of $66 million. The foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $80 million of foreign tax credits, with no related 24THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued)incremental U.S. income tax expense. In addition, the company recorded discrete benefits totaling $54 million related to additional prior year foreign tax and other credits as well as restructuring and other costs associated with the 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies. The tax provision in the 2015 period was favorably affected by $37 million as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates. The effective tax rate in both 2016 and 2015 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $663 million and $477 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2017 will be less than 3% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. Income from continuing operations increased to $2.03 billion in 2016, from $1.98 billion in 2015. The increase in operating income in the 2016 period (discussed above) was offset in part by an increase in interest expense of $55 million primarily due to increases in outstanding debt to fund acquisitions and a lower tax benefit from income taxes in 2016.During 2016, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $3.16 billion compared with $2.82 billion for 2015. The increase primarily resulted from lower investments in working capital and higher income before amortization and depreciation in the 2016 period.As of December 31, 2016, the company’s short-term debt totaled $1.26 billion, including $300 million due within the next twelve months under a 3-year term loan agreement and $953 million of commercial paper obligations. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2016, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $72 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $786 million as of December 31, 2016 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, sales returns, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, and pension costs. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:(a)Accounts ReceivableThe company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. Such allowances totaled $77 million at December 31, 2016. The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required.(b)InventoriesThe company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, 25THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required.(c)Intangible Assets and GoodwillThe company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $12.63 billion at December 31, 2016. The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $21.33 billion and $1.34 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.Indications of fair value based on projections of profitability for 2017 and thereafter and on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2016, the date of the company’s impairment testing. There can be no assurance, however, that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary.With the completion of the FEI acquisition in September 2016, the company established a new reporting unit called Materials and Structural Analysis, which consists of the former FEI business. Because this reporting unit consists solely of the acquired business, the book value of which equaled its fair value as of the acquisition date, no cushion of fair value over book value existed at the acquisition date. During its 2016 goodwill impairment testing, the company determined that the Materials and Structural Analysis reporting unit’s cushion of fair value over book value was nominal as of November 5, 2016. Given that the fair value is not substantially in excess of the book value, relatively small decreases in future cash flows from forecasted results or changes in discount rates or other assumptions could result in impairment of goodwill. The key variables that drive the cash flows of the reporting unit are levels of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) rate applied. The estimates used for these assumptions represent management's best estimates, which the company believes are reasonable. These assumptions, however, are subject to uncertainty, including the degree to which the acquired business will grow revenue and profitability levels. The Materials and Structural Analysis reporting unit had $1.99 billion of goodwill, and had an overall carrying value of $3.93 billion as of December 31, 2016.(d)RevenuesIn instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes. The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation. The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative selling price at the time of sale. Should the relative value of either the equipment or the installation change, the company’s revenue recognition would be affected.26THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)In instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer’s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition. If the nature of customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing.The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers. Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required.(e)Income TaxesIn the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. The company’s reserve for these matters totaled $802 million at December 31, 2016. Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes.The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income.The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit, based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $113 million at December 31, 2016. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary.The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the company’s tax provision would result.The company operates in various jurisdictions around the world. With the exception of its Affymetrix Singapore subsidiary, the company has not provided income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries due to its intention to permanently reinvest such earnings unless the company can remit such earnings to the U.S. without associated net tax cost. The company recorded a deferred tax liability of $156 million in acquisition accounting for the outside basis difference of Affymetrix Singapore as the company intends to integrate it with the company’s existing Singapore operations within the next twelve months. Aside from this plan, the company’s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax cost.(f)Contingencies and LitigationThe company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Accruals of acquired businesses, including product liability and environmental accruals, were initially recorded at fair value and 27THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.(g)Pension and Other Retiree BenefitsSeveral of the company’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $34 million in 2016. The company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $610 million at year-end 2016 compared with $528 million at year-end 2015. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $93 million.As of December 31, 2016, the company expects to contribute between $215 and $235 million to its existing defined benefit pension plans in 2017.As of January 1, 2017, the company changed the method it uses to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other retiree benefit plans. Historically, the company estimated these service and interest cost components utilizing the single weighted-average discount rate used to measure each plan's benefit obligation at the beginning of the year. Beginning in 2017, the company will utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot-rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. The company has made this change to provide a more precise measurement of the service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. The company has accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and will account for it prospectively starting in January 2017. The reduction in service and interest costs for 2017 associated with this change in estimate will be approximately $10 million.Results of Operations2016 Compared With 2015 (In millions) 2016 2015 TotalChange CurrencyTranslation Acquisitions/Divestitures Operations Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $4,978.1 $4,439.4 $538.7 $(37.5) $261.1 $315.1Analytical Instruments 3,668.2 3,208.2 460.0 (26.8) 386.9 99.9Specialty Diagnostics 3,339.2 3,243.9 95.3 (19.7) 0.2 114.8Laboratory Products and Services 7,030.0 6,661.5 368.5 (75.5) 89.6 354.4Eliminations (741.4) (587.6) (153.8) 14.6 (5.2) (163.2) Consolidated Revenues $18,274.1 $16,965.4 $1,308.7 $(144.9) $732.6 $721.0Sales in 2016 were $18.27 billion, an increase of $1.31 billion from 2015. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $145 million in 2016. Sales increased $733 million due to acquisitions. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $721 million (4%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales to customers in the company’s primary end markets grew. Demand from customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries was particularly strong. Sales growth was strong in Asia, moderate in Europe and modest in North America.In 2016, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.45 billion and 13.4%, respectively, compared with $2.34 billion and 13.8%, respectively, in 2015. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales in local currencies, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and, to a lesser extent, 28THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)acquisitions. These increases were offset in part by higher restructuring and acquisition-related charges in the 2016 period, strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix. In 2016, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $395 million, including $102 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and to conform the accounting policies of FEI and Affymetrix with the company's accounting policies; $104 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for third-party transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions of FEI and Affymetrix. In addition, the company recorded $164 million of cash restructuring costs, primarily to achieve acquisition synergies, including severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. The company’s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the U.S., Europe and Asia (see Note 14). The company also recorded charges for litigation and environmental remediation matters. These costs were partially offset by gains on the sales of real estate.In 2015, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $171 million, including $9 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation; $46 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for charges associated with product liability litigation, third-party transaction and integration costs primarily related to the acquisitions of Life Technologies and Alfa Aesar, and accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation. In addition, the company recorded $82 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for actions to achieve synergies from the Life Technologies acquisition and for abandoned facilities costs associated with a manufacturing facility in the U.S. The company’s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, including the consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The company also recorded charges for litigation-related matters associated with acquired businesses and impairment of acquired technology in development. These costs were partially offset by gains on the sale of a small product line and real estate.As of February 28, 2017, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $85 million in 2017 and expects to identify additional actions during 2017 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements and abandonment of leased facilities. Approximately 45% of the additional charges will be incurred in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, 35% in the Analytical Instruments segment, with the remainder incurred across the company's remaining segments. The restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2016 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $100 million beginning in part in 2016 and, to a greater extent, in 2017, including $60 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $25 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $5 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $10 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2015 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $100 million beginning in part in 2015 and to a greater extent in 2016, including $50 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $25 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $10 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $15 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.Segment ResultsThe company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.29THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 Change Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $4,978.1 $4,439.4 12%Analytical Instruments 3,668.2 3,208.2 14%Specialty Diagnostics 3,339.2 3,243.9 3%Laboratory Products and Services 7,030.0 6,661.5 6%Eliminations (741.4) (587.6) 26% Consolidated Revenues $18,274.1 $16,965.4 8% Segment Income Life Sciences Solutions $1,514.7 $1,336.9 13%Analytical Instruments 745.2 612.8 22%Specialty Diagnostics 909.8 872.9 4%Laboratory Products and Services 1,052.1 999.1 5% Subtotal Reportable Segments 4,221.8 3,821.7 10% Cost of Revenues Charges (101.5) (9.1) Selling, General and Administrative Charges, Net (103.9) (46.3) Restructuring and Other (Costs) Income, Net (189.2) (115.3) Amortization of Acquisition-related Intangible Assets (1,378.0) (1,314.8) Consolidated Operating Income $2,449.2 $2,336.2 5% Reportable Segments Operating Income Margin 23.1% 22.5% Consolidated Operating Income Margin 13.4% 13.8% Income from the company’s reportable segments increased 10% to $4.22 billion in 2016 due primarily to profit on higher sales in local currencies and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.

Sales increased $315 million (7%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $261 million due to acquisitions, offset in part by a decrease of $38 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for biosciences products and bioprocess production products and, to a lesser extent, next generation sequencing products.Operating income margin was 30.4% in 2016 compared to 30.1% in 2015. The increase in operating margin resulted from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, profit on higher sales in local currencies and, to a lesser extent, price increases. These increases were offset in part by unfavorable sales mix, acquisition dilution and strategic growth investments.30THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)Analytical Instruments(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 Change Revenues $3,668.2 $3,208.2 14% Operating Income Margin 20.3% 19.1% 1.2 ptSales in the Analytical Instruments segment increased $460 million to $3.67 billion in 2016. Sales increased $387 million due to acquisitions and $100 million (3%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses, offset in part by a decrease of $27 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for products sold by the segment's chromatography and mass spectrometry business and, to a lesser extent, sales of environmental instruments. These increases were offset in part by lower sales of chemical analysis products due primarily to softness in certain industrial end markets.Operating income margin was 20.3% in 2016 compared to 19.1% in 2015. The increase resulted primarily from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, profit on higher sales in local currencies and, to a lesser extent, favorable foreign currency exchange. These increases were offset in part by unfavorable sales mix and strategic growth investments.

Sales increased $115 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses, offset in part by a decrease of $20 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for products in each of the segment's principal businesses with particular strength in the segment’s healthcare market channel and sales of immunodiagnostics products and clinical diagnostics products.Operating income margin was 27.2% in 2016 and 26.9% in 2015. The increase resulted primarily from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and profit on higher sales in local currencies, offset in part by strategic growth investments.Laboratory Products and Services(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 Change Revenues $7,030.0 $6,661.5 6% Operating Income Margin 15.0% 15.0% 0.0 ptSales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $369 million to $7.03 billion in 2016. Sales increased $354 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $90 million due to an acquisition. These increases were offset in part by $76 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for products in each of the segment’s principal businesses.Operating income margin was 15.0% in both 2016 and 2015. Increases due to productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and profit on higher sales in local currencies, were offset by strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix.31THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)Other Expense, NetThe company reported other expense, net, of $425 million and $400 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively (Note 4). Interest expense increased $55 million primarily due to an increase in outstanding debt. In 2016, other items, net includes $22 million of charges related to the amortization of fees paid to obtain bridge financing commitments for the acquisition of FEI and $9 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt, offset in part by $12.5 million of gains on investments. In 2015, other items, net includes losses of $12 million on the early extinguishment of debt and costs of $7.5 million associated with entering into interest rate swap arrangements. Provision for Income TaxesThe company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2016. In 2016, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $91 million, offset in part by additional U.S. taxes of $37 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2016) for a net benefit of $54 million. The foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. The company intends to make similar types of distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries when they can be made at no net tax cost. The ability of the company to make distributions in future periods of similar type and magnitude will depend on the level of earnings and cash flow in various foreign jurisdictions and on the applicable tax laws in effect at that time. Accordingly, the impact of foreign tax credits on the company’s effective tax rate in future periods is likely to vary. The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $100 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. In addition, the company recorded discrete benefits in 2016 totaling $39 million related to prior year tax filings and net charges of $12 million related to tax audits.The company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2015. In 2015, the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $111 million, offset in part by additional U.S. taxes of $46 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2015) for a net benefit of $66 million. The foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $80 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. In addition, the company recorded discrete benefits totaling $54 million related to additional prior year foreign tax and other credits as well as restructuring and other costs associated with the 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies. The tax provision in the 2015 period was favorably affected by $37 million as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates. The effective tax rate in both 2016 and 2015 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $663 million and $477 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.The company expects its effective tax rate in 2017 will be less than 3% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits.The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. All of these countries except one have a lower tax rate than the U.S. The countries in which the company has a material presence that have significantly lower tax rates than the U.S. include Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate.Recent Accounting PronouncementsA description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1.32THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)Contingent LiabilitiesThe company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the headings “Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters,"" ""Intellectual Property Matters"" and ""Commercial Matters"" in Note 10 could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.2015 Compared With 2014(In millions) 2015 2014 TotalChange CurrencyTranslation Acquisitions/Divestitures Operations Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $4,439.4 $4,195.7 $243.7 $(263.8) $305.9 $201.6Analytical Instruments 3,208.2 3,252.2 (44.0) (188.8) 4.1 140.7Specialty Diagnostics 3,243.9 3,343.6 (99.7) (196.6) 10.8 86.1Laboratory Products and Services 6,661.5 6,601.5 60.0 (302.9) (101.9) 464.8Eliminations (587.6) (503.4) (84.2) 13.8 (7.4) (90.6) Consolidated Revenues $16,965.4 $16,889.6 $75.8 $(938.3) $211.5 $802.6Sales in 2015 were $16.97 billion, an increase of $76 million from 2014. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $938 million in 2015. Sales increased $212 million due to acquisitions, principally Life Technologies, net of divestitures. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions/divestitures, revenues increased $803 million (5%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales to customers in the company’s primary end markets grew. Demand from customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries was particularly strong. Sales growth was moderate in North America and Europe and strong in Asia.In 2015, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.34 billion and 13.8%, respectively, compared with $2.50 billion and 14.8%, respectively, in 2014. The decrease in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to net gains of $895 million on the sale of businesses in 2014, offset in part by $450 million of charges in 2014 associated with the February 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange also contributed to the decrease in profitability. These factors that reduced operating income in 2015 were offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, profit on higher sales in local currencies. In 2015, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $171 million, including $9 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation; $46 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for charges associated with product liability litigation, third-party transaction and integration costs primarily related to the acquisitions of Life Technologies and Alfa Aesar, and accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation. In addition, the company recorded $82 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for actions to achieve synergies from the Life Technologies acquisition and for abandoned facilities costs associated with a manufacturing facility in the U.S. The company’s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, including the consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The company also recorded charges for litigation-related matters associated with acquired businesses and impairment of acquired technology in development. These costs were partially offset by gains on the sale of a small product line and real estate (see Note 14). In 2014, the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $140 million, including net gains on the sale of businesses and real estate of $895 million and $15 million, respectively, offset in part by $328 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition; $131 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for transaction costs related to the acquisition of Life Technologies; and $29 million of charges for pension settlements.

Had the acquisition of Life Technologies been completed at the beginning of 2013, revenues for the 2015 period would have decreased $25 million compared to pro forma 2014 revenues, including a decrease of $278 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation, offset in part by an increase of $213 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and an increase of $40 million due to other acquisitions, net of dispositions. The increase in pro forma revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for bioprocess production products as well as biosciences products.Operating income margin was 30.1% in 2015 compared to 29.0% in 2014. The increase resulted primarily from productivity improvements (including acquisition cost synergies), net of inflationary cost increases and favorable sales mix. These increases were offset in part by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange and, to a lesser extent, by exclusion in 2014 of January’s lower margin results for Life Technologies. Results for January commonly have a lower margin rate than results for the balance of the quarter, due to the phasing of revenue and costs.Analytical Instruments(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 Change Revenues $3,208.2 $3,252.2 (1)% Operating Income Margin 19.1% 17.9% 1.2 ptSales in the Analytical Instruments segment decreased $44 million to $3.21 billion in 2015.

The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for chromatography products and, to a lesser extent, sales of service offerings and increased demand for mass spectrometry instruments. These increases were offset in part by modestly lower sales of chemical analysis products due primarily to softness in certain commodity materials markets.Operating income margin was 19.1% in 2015 compared to 17.9% in 2014. The increase resulted primarily from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and profit on incremental sales in local currencies, offset in part by strategic growth investments and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange.Specialty Diagnostics(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 Change Revenues $3,243.9 $3,343.6 (3)% Operating Income Margin 26.9% 27.4% -0.5 ptSales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment decreased $100 million to $3.24 billion in 2015. Sales decreased $197 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation offset in part by $86 million (3%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $11 million due to an acquisition net of a divestiture. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for clinical diagnostics products, products sold through the segment’s healthcare market channel and immunodiagnostics products. These increases were offset in part by lower sales due to the expiration, in late 2014, of an OEM contract following the acquisition of the customer by a competitor.Operating income margin was 26.9% in 2015 and 27.4% in 2014. The decrease resulted primarily from strategic growth investments and unfavorable foreign currency exchange, offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.35THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)Laboratory Products and Services(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 Change Revenues $6,661.5 $6,601.5 1% Operating Income Margin 15.0% 14.9% 0.1 ptSales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $60 million to $6.66 billion in 2015.

Interest expense decreased $65 million primarily due to a reduction in outstanding debt and effective interest rates. In 2015, other items, net includes losses of $12 million on the early extinguishment of debt and costs of $7.5 million associated with entering into interest rate swap arrangements. In 2014, other items, net includes net gains of $9 million on the sale of investments. Provision for Income TaxesThe company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2015. In 2015, the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $111 million, offset in part by additional U.S. taxes of $46 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2015) for a net benefit of $66 million. The foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $80 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. In addition, the company recorded discrete benefits totaling $54 million related to additional prior year foreign tax and other credits as well as restructuring and other costs associated with the 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies. The tax provision in the 2015 period was favorably affected by $37 million as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates. The company’s effective tax rate was 9.2% in 2014. The 2014 provision for income taxes included $390 million related to gains on the sales of businesses. Aside from the discrete tax on the gains, the company had a benefit from income taxes primarily due to restructuring and other costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies as well as an increase in the expected benefit from foreign tax credits. In 2014, the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $172 million, offset in part by additional U.S. taxes of $55 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2014) for a net benefit of $117 million. The foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. The federal tax credit for 2014 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2014 by $20 million. In 2014, the company recognized a discrete tax benefit of $15 million attributable to tax rulings related to non-U.S. subsidiaries. The tax provision in the 2014 period was favorably affected by $5.5 million as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates. The effective tax rate in both 2015 and 2014 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $477 million and $586 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.36THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital ResourcesConsolidated working capital was $2.16 billion at December 31, 2016, compared with $1.59 billion at December 31, 2015. Included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $786 million at December 31, 2016 and $452 million at December 31, 2015. 2016 Cash provided by operating activities was $3.16 billion during 2016. An increase in accounts receivable used cash of $352 million primarily to support growth in sales in local currencies and due to the mid-month timing of the acquisition of FEI when receivables are commonly lower than at quarter-end. Inventories provided cash of $98 million due to a reduction associated with fourth quarter 2016 sales. An increase in other assets used cash of $153 million primarily due to the timing of payments. An increase in other liabilities provided cash of $168 million primarily due to the timing of payments for income taxes and incentive compensation. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $663 million during 2016, compared with $477 million in 2015. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $43 million during 2016. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $122 million during 2016.During 2016, the company’s investing activities used $5.53 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $5.19 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $444 million of property, plant and equipment. In February 2017, the company completed an acquisition for approximately $225 million in cash (Note 16).The company’s financing activities provided $2.86 billion of cash during 2016. Issuance of senior notes and borrowings under term loans provided cash of $7.60 billion and an increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $904 million. Repayment of senior notes, the 364-day term loan and acquired debt used cash of $4.33 billion. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.25 billion of the company’s common stock and the payment of $238 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $135 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises. On July 7, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.50 billion of the company’s common stock. At December 31, 2016, $1.25 billion was available for future repurchases of the company’s common stock under this authorization. Early in the first quarter of 2017, the company repurchased $500 million of the company's common stock which reduced the availability under this authorization to $750 million as of February 28, 2017.As of December 31, 2016, the company’s short-term debt totaled $1.26 billion, including $300 million due within the next twelve months under a 3-year term loan agreement and $953 million of commercial paper obligations. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2016, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $72 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the U.S. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. foreign tax credit equals or exceeds any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future.The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $786 million as of December 31, 2016 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2015 Cash provided by operating activities was $2.82 billion during 2015. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $149 million and $141 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales in local currencies. An increase in other assets used cash of $254 million primarily related to the timing of tax payments/refunds. An increase in other liabilities provided cash of $148 million primarily due to the timing of payments for income taxes and incentive compensation. Cash payments for income taxes decreased to $477 million during 2015, compared with $586 million in 2014 that included taxes associated with gains on divestitures. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans 37THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)totaling $38 million during 2015. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $97 million during 2015.During 2015, the company’s investing activities used $1.09 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $695 million. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $423 million of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities used $2.49 billion of cash during 2015. Repayments of long-term debt totaled $3.78 billion. Issuance of senior notes provided cash of $1.80 billion and an increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $50 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $500 million of the company’s common stock and the payment of $241 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $124 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises.2014Cash provided by operating activities was $2.62 billion during 2014 primarily from the company’s earnings. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $145 million and $110 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Other assets decreased by $163 million primarily due to collection of tax refunds including those related to legacy Life Technologies’ operations. Other liabilities increased by $308 million primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation and income taxes. In 2014, the company made cash payments including monetizing certain equity awards, severance obligations and transaction costs totaling $325 million related to the acquisition of Life Technologies. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $50 million during 2014. Cash payments for income taxes totaled $586 million. During 2014, the company’s investing activities used $11.78 billion of cash, principally for the acquisition of Life Technologies. Acquisitions used cash of $13.06 billion. Proceeds from the sale of businesses provided $1.52 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $428 million of property, plant and equipment.The company’s financing activities provided $4.80 billion of cash during 2014. To partially fund the acquisition of Life Technologies, the company borrowed $5.00 billion under an unsecured term loan and issued 34.9 million shares of its common stock for net proceeds of $2.94 billion in cash (Note 11). Other long-term borrowings totaled $1.59 billion. Repayments of long-term debt, principally the term loan, totaled $4.43 billion. A decrease in commercial paper obligations used cash of $250 million. The company’s financing activities also included the receipt of $155 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises offset by the payment of $235 million in cash dividends.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe company did not use special purpose entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2014, 2015 or 2016, except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, residual value guarantees under three lease agreements, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table or discussed below. The amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees relate to guarantees of the company’s performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business.38THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial CommitmentsThe table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the company’s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2016.

Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty.(c)Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company.Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $802 million have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions.The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, other than those included in the above table, but expects that for 2017, such expenditures will approximate $500 million.Guarantees of residual value under lease arrangements for three facilities have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantees may require payment (see Note 10). The residual value guarantees become operative at the end of the leases for up to a maximum of $155 million. The initial terms of these leases end in 2019, 2020 and 2022, although renewal options exist for each.A guarantee of pension plan obligations of a divested business has not been included in the preceding table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantee may require payment. The purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits, however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so. The amount of the guarantee at December 31, 2016 was $40 million.In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and related legal fees. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows.39THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business – Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, Norwegian kroner, and Swedish kronor. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements.Interest RatesThe company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2016, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2016 was $16.98 billion (see Note 12). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2016 would increase by approximately $840 million. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2016 would decrease by approximately $802 million.In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. In 2016, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the swap arrangements and variable-rate debt would have increased the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $42 million.Currency Exchange RatesThe company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in British pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, euro, Danish kroner, Canadian dollars and Swiss franc. The effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2016 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $1.19 billion.The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2016 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $126 million. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2016 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $117 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2016 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $36 million on the company’s net income.40THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.",2023-12-30 17:37:58.717663

The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s continuing operations fall into four business segments (see Note 3): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services. Recent Acquisitions and DivestituresThe company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. The company’s principal recent acquisitions are described below.In February 2015, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Advanced Scientifics, Inc., a North America-based global provider of single-use systems and process equipment for bioprocess production, for approximately $289 million. The acquisition expanded the company’s bioprocessing offerings. Revenues of Advanced Scientifics were approximately $80 million in 2014.On September 30, 2015, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Alfa Aesar, a U.K.-based global manufacturer of research chemicals from Johnson Matthey Plc, for £257 million ($393 million) in cash. The acquisition expanded the company’s existing portfolio of chemicals, solvents and reagents. Revenues of Alfa Aesar were approximately £78 million in 2014. On March 31, 2016, the company acquired, primarily within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Affymetrix, Inc., a North America-based provider of cellular and genetic analysis products, for a total purchase price of $1.34 billion, net of cash acquired, including the assumption of $254 million of debt. The acquisition expanded the company's existing portfolio of antibodies and assays for flow cytometry and single-cell biology applications. Additionally, the acquisition expanded the company's genetic analysis portfolio through the addition of microarrays. Revenues of Affymetrix were $360 million in 2015. On September 19, 2016, the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, FEI Company, a North America-based provider of high-performance electron microscopy, for a total purchase price of $4.08 billion, net of cash acquired. The acquisition strengthened the company's analytical instrument portfolio with the addition of high-end electron microscopes. Revenues of FEI were $930 million in 2015.On February 14, 2017, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Finesse Solutions, Inc., a North America-based developer of scalable control automation systems and software for bioproduction, for a total purchase price of $221 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition expanded the company's bioproduction offerings. Revenues of Finesse Solutions were approximately $50 million in 2016.On March 2, 2017, the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, Core Informatics, a North America-based provider of cloud-based platforms supporting scientific data management, for a total purchase price of $94 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition enhanced the company's existing informatics solutions. Revenues of Core Informatics were approximately $10 million in 2016. On August 29, 2017, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, substantially all of the issued and outstanding shares of Patheon N.V., a leading global provider of high-quality drug development and delivery solutions to the pharmaceutical and biopharma sectors, for $35.00 per share in cash, or $7.36 billion, including the assumption of net debt. The company financed the purchase price, including the repayment of indebtedness of Patheon, with issuances of debt and equity. Patheon provides comprehensive, integrated and highly customizable solutions as well as the expertise to help biopharmaceutical companies of all sizes satisfy complex development and manufacturing needs. The acquisition provided entry into the pharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing organization market and added a complementary service to the company's existing pharmaceutical services portfolio. Patheon's revenues totaled $1.87 billion for the year ended October 31, 2016.24THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of Results of Operations and Liquidity(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $5,728 27.4 % $5,317 29.1 %Analytical Instruments 4,821 23.0 % 3,668 20.1 %Specialty Diagnostics 3,486 16.7 % 3,339 18.3 %Laboratory Products and Services 7,825 37.4 % 6,724 36.8 %Eliminations (942) (4.5)% (774) (4.3)% $20,918 100 % $18,274 100 %Sales in 2017 were $20.92 billion, an increase of $2.64 billion from 2016. Sales increased $1.63 billion due to acquisitions. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $70 million in 2017. Aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $949 million (5%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales to customers in each of the company's primary end markets grew. Sales growth was moderate in North America and Europe and particularly strong in Asia. In 2017, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.97 billion and 14.2%, respectively, compared with $2.45 billion and 13.4%, respectively, in 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales in local currencies, the effects of acquisitions and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by an increase in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, due to recent acquisitions, and strategic growth investments. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. The increase in our effective tax rate in 2017 was principally due to a net provision of $204 million from the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), consisting primarily of a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, net of a benefit from adjusting the deferred tax balances for the U.S. statutory tax rate reduction. Although the net $204 million charge represents what the company believes is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act, the components of the net charge are provisional and may change as discussed in Note 7. In 2017, the company refinanced certain long term inter-company debt which resulted in an income tax benefit of $237 million related to a foreign exchange loss recognized for income tax purposes. In addition, in 2017 the company recorded a $65 million favorable adjustment to deferred tax balances due to extension of a tax holiday agreement in Singapore and $65 million of benefit associated with new required accounting for tax benefits from equity awards, as discussed in Note 1. The company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries in 2017. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $86 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $53 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2017) for a net benefit of $33 million. The foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. The company intends to make similar types of distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries when they can be made at no net tax cost. The ability of the company to make distributions in future periods of similar type and magnitude will depend on the level of earnings and cash flow in various foreign jurisdictions and on the applicable tax laws in effect at that time. Accordingly, the impact of foreign tax credits on the company’s effective tax rate in future periods is likely to vary. The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $20 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. The company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2016. In 2016, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $91 million, offset in part by additional U.S. taxes of $37 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2016) for a net benefit of $54 million. 25THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued)The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $100 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. In addition, the company recorded discrete benefits in 2016 totaling $39 million related to prior year tax filings and net charges of $12 million related to tax audits. The effective tax rate in both 2017 and 2016 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $479 million and $663 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2018 will be between 6% and 9% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. Income from continuing operations increased to $2.23 billion in 2017, from $2.03 billion in 2016. The increase in operating income in 2017 (discussed above) was offset in part by an increase in interest expense of $123 million primarily due to increases in outstanding debt to fund acquisitions and the increase in the tax provision in 2017 (discussed above).During 2017, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $4.01 billion compared with $3.26 billion for 2016. The increase primarily resulted from higher income before amortization and depreciation in the 2017 period and lower investment in working capital in 2017.As of December 31, 2017, the company’s short-term debt totaled $2.14 billion, including $0.96 billion of commercial paper obligations and $1.17 billion of senior notes due within the next twelve months. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2017, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $77 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $1.34 billion as of December 31, 2017 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, sales returns, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, and pension costs. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:(a)Intangible Assets and GoodwillThe company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at 26THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)the dates of acquisition. Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $15.41 billion at December 31, 2017. The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $25.29 billion and $1.27 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2017. Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.For reporting units where the company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test, indications of fair value based on projections of profitability for 2018 and thereafter and on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2017, the date of the company’s impairment testing. There can be no assurance, however, that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary.With the completion of the Patheon acquisition in August 2017, the company established a new reporting unit which solely consists of the legacy Patheon business, the book carrying value of which equaled its fair value as of the acquisition date. During its annual 2017 goodwill impairment assessment, the company performed a qualitative assessment of this reporting unit and determined that no events had occurred and no circumstances had changed that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. As a result, the company did not perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit. Given that the fair value of the reporting unit was not substantially in excess of its carrying value as of the annual 2017 assessment date, relatively small decreases in future cash flows from anticipated results could result in impairment of goodwill. The key variables that will drive the cash flows of the reporting unit will be levels of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the weighted average cost of capital rate applied. The business unit consisting of the legacy Patheon business had $3.25 billion of goodwill, and an overall carrying value of $7.33 billion as of December 31, 2017.(b)Income TaxesIn the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. The company’s reserve for these matters totaled $1.41 billion at December 31, 2017.The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s 27THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income.The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. In situations in which the company has been able to conclude that its deferred tax assets will be realized, it has generally relied on future reversals of taxable temporary differences, expected future taxable income where such estimates have historically been reliable, and other factors. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $256 million at December 31, 2017. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary.The company has not provided state income or foreign withholding taxes on certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings, as such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the United States indefinitely in the respective jurisdictions based on specific business plans and tax strategies. These business plans and tax strategies consider: short-term and long-term forecasts and budgets of the U.S. parent and non-U.S. subsidiaries; working capital and other needs in locations where earnings are generated; the company’s past practices regarding non-U.S. subsidiary dividends; sources of financing by the U.S. parent, such as issuing debt or equity; and uses of cash by the U.S. parent that are more discretionary in nature, such as business combinations and share repurchase programs. However, should the company change its business plans and tax strategies in the future and decide to repatriate a portion of these earnings to one of its U.S. subsidiaries, including cash maintained by these non-U.S. subsidiaries, the company would recognize additional U.S. tax liabilities. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional state and foreign withholding tax liabilities that the company would incur.(c)Contingencies and LitigationThe company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Accruals of acquired businesses, including product liability and environmental accruals, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.(d)Pension and Other Retiree BenefitsSeveral of the company’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $25 million in 2017. The company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $486 million at year-end 2017 compared with $610 million at year-end 2016. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $95 million.As of December 31, 2017, the company expects to contribute between $35 and $65 million to its existing defined benefit pension plans in 2018.28THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations2017 Compared With 2016 (In millions) 2017 2016 TotalChange CurrencyTranslation Acquisitions/Divestitures Operations Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $5,728 $5,317 $411 $12 $99 $300Analytical Instruments 4,821 3,668 1,153 29 794 330Specialty Diagnostics 3,486 3,339 147 12 9 126Laboratory Products and Services 7,825 6,724 1,101 13 727 361Eliminations (942) (774) (168) 4 (4) (168) Consolidated Revenues $20,918 $18,274 $2,644 $70 $1,625 $949Sales in 2017 were $20.92 billion, an increase of $2.64 billion from 2016. Sales increased $1.63 billion due to acquisitions. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $70 million in 2017. Aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $949 million (5%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales to customers in each of the company's primary end markets grew. Sales growth was moderate in North America and Europe and particularly strong in Asia.In 2017, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.97 billion and 14.2%, respectively, compared with $2.45 billion and 13.4%, respectively, in 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales in local currencies, the effects of acquisitions and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by an increase in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, due to recent acquisitions, and strategic growth investments. In 2017, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $298 million, including $123 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, and, to a lesser extent, to conform the accounting policies of Patheon to the company's accounting policies. The company recorded $78 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily for third-party transaction and integration costs associated with recent acquisitions and changes in estimates of acquisition contingent consideration. In addition, the company recorded $97 million of cash restructuring costs, primarily to achieve acquisition synergies, including severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S and Europe. The company’s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The company also recorded $27 million of net credits for litigation-related matters, which were mostly offset by compensation due at Patheon on the date of the acquisition, hurricane response/impairment costs, and net charges for the settlement/curtailment of retirement plans (see Note 14).In 2016, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $395 million, including $102 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and to conform the accounting policies of FEI and Affymetrix to the company's accounting policies; $104 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for third-party transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions of FEI and Affymetrix. In addition, the company recorded $164 million of cash restructuring costs, primarily to achieve acquisition synergies, including severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. The company’s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The company also recorded charges for litigation and environmental remediation matters. These costs were partially offset by gains on the sales of real estate.As of February 28, 2018, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $105 million, primarily in 2018, and expects to identify additional actions during 2018 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements and abandonment of leased facilities. Approximately 35% of the additional charges will be incurred in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, 25% in the Analytical 29THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)Instruments segment, 30% in the Laboratory Products and Services segment, and 10% in the Specialty Diagnostics segment. The restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2017 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $90 million beginning in part in 2017 and, to a greater extent, in 2018, including $50 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $20 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $10 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $10 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2016 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $100 million beginning in part in 2016 and to a greater extent in 2017, including $60 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $25 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $5 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $10 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.Segment ResultsThe company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 Change Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $5,728 $5,317 8%Analytical Instruments 4,821 3,668 31%Specialty Diagnostics 3,486 3,339 4%Laboratory Products and Services 7,825 6,724 16%Eliminations (942) (774) 22% Consolidated Revenues $20,918 $18,274 14% Segment Income Life Sciences Solutions $1,896 $1,596 19%Analytical Instruments 1,027 745 38%Specialty Diagnostics 930 910 2%Laboratory Products and Services 1,007 971 4% Subtotal Reportable Segments 4,860 4,222 15% Cost of Revenues Charges (123) (102) Selling, General and Administrative Charges, Net (78) (104) Restructuring and Other (Costs) Income, Net (97) (189) Amortization of Acquisition-related Intangible Assets (1,594) (1,378) Consolidated Operating Income $2,968 $2,449 21% Reportable Segments Operating Income Margin 23.2% 23.1% Consolidated Operating Income Margin 14.2% 13.4% Income from the company’s reportable segments increased 15% to $4.86 billion in 2017 due primarily to profit on higher sales in local currencies, the effects of acquisitions and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by strategic growth investments.30THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)Life Sciences Solutions(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 Change Revenues $5,728 $5,317 8% Operating Income Margin 33.1% 30.0% 3.1 ptSales in the Life Sciences Solutions segment increased $411 million to $5.73 billion in 2017. Sales increased $300 million (6%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses, $99 million due to acquisitions and $12 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for biosciences products and, to a lesser extent, bioprocess production products as well as genetic sciences products.Operating income margin was 33.1% in 2017 compared to 30.0% in 2016. The increase in operating margin resulted primarily from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and, to a lesser extent, profit on higher sales in local currencies and price increases. These increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments and acquisition dilution.Analytical Instruments(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 Change Revenues $4,821 $3,668 31% Operating Income Margin 21.3% 20.3% 1.0 ptSales in the Analytical Instruments segment increased $1.15 billion to $4.82 billion in 2017. Sales increased $794 million due to acquisitions, $330 million (9%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $29 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand in each of the segment's primary businesses particularly products sold by the segment's chromatography and mass spectrometry business and materials and structural analysis business.Operating income margin was 21.3% in 2017 compared to 20.3% in 2016. The increase resulted primarily from profit on higher sales in local currencies, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, the effect of acquisitions, offset in part by strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and unfavorable sales mix.Specialty Diagnostics(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 Change Revenues $3,486 $3,339 4% Operating Income Margin 26.7% 27.2% -0.5 ptSales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $147 million to $3.49 billion in 2017. Sales increased $126 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses, $12 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation and $9 million due to acquisitions. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to higher demand for products sold through the segment's healthcare market channel as well as clinical diagnostics products and immunodiagnostics products.Operating income margin was 26.7% in 2017 and 27.2% in 2016. The decrease resulted primarily from strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable sales mix, offset in part by profit on higher sales in local currencies and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.31THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)Laboratory Products and Services(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 Change Revenues $7,825 $6,724 16% Operating Income Margin 12.9% 14.4% -1.5 ptSales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $1.10 billion to $7.83 billion in 2017. Sales increased $727 million due to acquisitions, $361 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $13 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for products sold through the segment's channel business and, to a lesser extent, laboratory equipment and consumables.Operating income margin was 12.9% in 2017 compared to 14.4% in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable sales mix and strategic growth investments offset in part by profit on higher sales in local currencies and, to a lesser extent, the effect of acquisitions.Other Expense, NetThe company reported other expense, net, of $539 million and $425 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively (Note 4). Interest expense increased $123 million primarily due to an increase in outstanding debt. Provision for Income TaxesThe increase in our effective tax rate in 2017 was principally due to a net provision of $204 million from the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, consisting primarily of a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, net of a benefit from adjusting the deferred tax balances for the U.S. statutory tax rate reduction. Although the net $204 million charge represents what the company believes is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act, the components of the net charge are provisional and may change as discussed in Note 7. In 2017, the company refinanced certain long term inter-company debt which resulted in an income tax benefit of $237 million related to a foreign exchange loss recognized for income tax purposes. In addition, in 2017 the company recorded a $65 million favorable adjustment to deferred tax balances due to extension of a tax holiday agreement in Singapore and $65 million of benefit associated with new required accounting for tax benefits from equity awards, as discussed in Note 1. The company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries in 2017. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $86 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $53 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2017) for a net benefit of $33 million. The foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. The company intends to make similar types of distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries when they can be made at no net tax cost. The ability of the company to make distributions in future periods of similar type and magnitude will depend on the level of earnings and cash flow in various foreign jurisdictions and on the applicable tax laws in effect at that time. Accordingly, the impact of foreign tax credits on the company’s effective tax rate in future periods is likely to vary. The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $20 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense.The company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2016. In 2016, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $91 million, offset in part by additional U.S. taxes of $37 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2016) for a net benefit of $54 million. The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $100 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. In addition, the company recorded discrete benefits in 2016 totaling $39 million related to prior year tax filings and net charges of $12 million related to tax audits.The effective tax rate in both 2017 and 2016 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for 32THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $479 million and $663 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.The company expects its effective tax rate in 2018 will be between 6% and 9% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events.The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate.Recent Accounting PronouncementsA description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading ""Recent Accounting Pronouncements"" in Note 1.Contingent LiabilitiesThe company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the headings ""Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters,"" ""Intellectual Property Matters"" and ""Commercial Matters"" in Note 10 could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.2016 Compared With 2015(In millions) 2016 2015 TotalChange CurrencyTranslation Acquisitions/Divestitures Operations Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $5,317 $4,774 $543 $(38) $255 $326Analytical Instruments 3,668 3,208 460 (27) 387 100Specialty Diagnostics 3,339 3,244 95 (20) — 115Laboratory Products and Services 6,724 6,372 352 (75) 96 331Eliminations (774) (633) (141) 15 (5) (151) Consolidated Revenues $18,274 $16,965 $1,309 $(145) $733 $721Sales in 2016 were $18.27 billion, an increase of $1.31 billion from 2015. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $145 million in 2016. Sales increased $733 million due to acquisitions. Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $721 million (4%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales to customers in the company’s primary end markets grew. Demand from customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries was particularly strong. Sales growth was strong in Asia, moderate in Europe and modest in North America.In 2016, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.45 billion and 13.4%, respectively, compared with $2.34 billion and 13.8%, respectively, in 2015. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales in local currencies, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and, to a lesser extent, acquisitions. These increases were offset in part by higher restructuring and acquisition-related charges in the 2016 period, strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix. In 2016, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $395 million, including $102 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and to conform the accounting policies of FEI and Affymetrix to the company's accounting policies; $104 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for third-party transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions of FEI and Affymetrix. In addition, the company recorded $164 million of cash restructuring costs, primarily to achieve acquisition synergies, including severance and 33THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. The company’s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the U.S., Europe and Asia (see Note 14). The company also recorded charges for litigation and environmental remediation matters. These costs were partially offset by gains on the sales of real estate.In 2015, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $171 million, including $9 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation; $46 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for charges associated with product liability litigation, third-party transaction and integration costs primarily related to the acquisitions of Life Technologies and Alfa Aesar, and accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation. In addition, the company recorded $82 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for actions to achieve synergies from the Life Technologies acquisition and for abandoned facilities costs associated with a manufacturing facility in the U.S. The company’s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, including the consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The company also recorded charges for litigation-related matters associated with acquired businesses and impairment of acquired technology in development. These costs were partially offset by gains on the sale of a small product line and real estate.The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2015 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $100 million beginning in part in 2015 and to a greater extent in 2016, including $50 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $25 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $10 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $15 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.Segment Results(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 Change Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $5,317 $4,774 11%Analytical Instruments 3,668 3,208 14%Specialty Diagnostics 3,339 3,244 3%Laboratory Products and Services 6,724 6,372 6%Eliminations (774) (633) 22% Consolidated Revenues $18,274 $16,965 8% Segment Income Life Sciences Solutions $1,596 $1,414 13%Analytical Instruments 745 613 22%Specialty Diagnostics 910 873 4%Laboratory Products and Services 971 922 5% Subtotal Reportable Segments 4,222 3,822 10% Cost of Revenues Charges (102) (9) Selling, General and Administrative Costs, Net (104) (46) Restructuring and Other Income (Costs), Net (189) (116) Amortization of Acquisition-related Intangible Assets (1,378) (1,315) Consolidated Operating Income $2,449 $2,336 5% Reportable Segments Operating Income Margin 23.1% 22.5% Consolidated Operating Income Margin 13.4% 13.8% 34THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)Income from the company’s reportable segments increased 10% to $4.22 billion in 2016 due primarily to profit on higher sales in local currencies and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.

Sales increased $326 million (7%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $255 million due to acquisitions, offset in part by a decrease of $38 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for biosciences products and bioprocess production products and, to a lesser extent, next generation sequencing products.Operating income margin was 30.0% in 2016 compared to 29.6% in 2015. The increase in operating margin resulted from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, profit on higher sales in local currencies and, to a lesser extent, price increases. These increases were offset in part by unfavorable sales mix, acquisition dilution and strategic growth investments.Analytical Instruments(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 Change Revenues $3,668 $3,208 14% Operating Income Margin 20.3% 19.1% 1.2 ptSales in the Analytical Instruments segment increased $460 million to $3.67 billion in 2016. Sales increased $387 million due to acquisitions and $100 million (3%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses, offset in part by a decrease of $27 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for products sold by the segment's chromatography and mass spectrometry business and, to a lesser extent, sales of environmental instruments. These increases were offset in part by lower sales of chemical analysis products due primarily to softness in certain industrial end markets.Operating income margin was 20.3% in 2016 compared to 19.1% in 2015. The increase resulted primarily from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, profit on higher sales in local currencies and, to a lesser extent, favorable foreign currency exchange. These increases were offset in part by unfavorable sales mix and strategic growth investments. Specialty Diagnostics(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 Change Revenues $3,339 $3,244 3% Operating Income Margin 27.2% 26.9% 0.3 ptSales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $95 million to $3.34 billion in 2016. Sales increased $115 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses, offset in part by a decrease of $20 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for products in each of the segment's principal businesses with particular strength in the segment’s healthcare market channel and sales of immunodiagnostics products and clinical diagnostics products.35THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)Operating income margin was 27.2% in 2016 and 26.9% in 2015. The increase resulted primarily from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and profit on higher sales in local currencies, offset in part by strategic growth investments.Laboratory Products and Services(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 Change Revenues $6,724 $6,372 6% Operating Income Margin 14.4% 14.5% -0.1 ptSales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $352 million to $6.72 billion in 2016. Sales increased $331 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $96 million due to an acquisition. These increases were offset in part by $75 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for products in each of the segment’s principal businesses.Operating income margin was 14.4% in 2016 compared to 14.5% in 2015. Decreases due to strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix were offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and profit on higher sales in local currencies.Other Expense, NetThe company reported other expense, net, of $425 million and $400 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively (Note 4). Interest expense increased $55 million primarily due to an increase in outstanding debt. In 2016, other items, net includes $22 million of charges related to the amortization of fees paid to obtain bridge financing commitments for the acquisition of FEI and $9 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt, offset in part by $12.5 million of gains on investments. In 2015, other items, net includes losses of $12 million on the early extinguishment of debt and costs of $7.5 million associated with entering into interest rate swap arrangements. Provision for Income TaxesThe company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2016. In 2016, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $91 million, offset in part by additional U.S. taxes of $37 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2016) for a net benefit of $54 million. The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $100 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. In addition, the company recorded discrete benefits in 2016 totaling $39 million related to prior year tax filings and net charges of $12 million related to tax audits. The company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2015. In 2015, the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $111 million, offset in part by additional U.S. taxes of $46 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2015) for a net benefit of $66 million. The foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $80 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. In addition, the company recorded discrete benefits totaling $54 million related to additional prior year foreign tax and other credits as well as restructuring and other costs associated with the 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies. The tax provision in the 2015 period was favorably affected by $37 million as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates. The effective tax rate in both 2016 and 2015 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $663 million and $477 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.36THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital ResourcesConsolidated working capital was $2.37 billion at December 31, 2017, compared with $2.16 billion at December 31, 2016. Included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $1.34 billion at December 31, 2017 and $786 million at December 31, 2016.2017 Cash provided by operating activities was $4.01 billion during 2017. An increase in other liabilities provided cash of $1.02 billion primarily due to the Tax Act's one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries. Given the availability of foreign tax credits, the company does not expect the transition tax to result in significant cash requirements. An increase in accounts payable provided cash of $274 million due to the timing of payments. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $362 million and $81 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales in local currencies. An increase in other assets used cash of $153 million primarily due to the timing of income tax refunds. Cash payments for income taxes decreased to $479 million during 2017, compared with $663 million in 2016. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $200 million during 2017. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $93 million during 2017.During 2017, the company’s investing activities used $7.73 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $7.23 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $508 million of property, plant and equipment.The company’s financing activities provided $3.85 billion of cash during 2017. Issuance of senior notes and borrowings under a term loan provided cash of $6.46 billion. The company also issued 10 million shares of its common stock for net proceeds of $1.69 billion. Repayment of senior notes and term loans used cash of $3.30 billion and a net decrease in commercial paper obligations used cash of $134 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $750 million of the company’s common stock and the payment of $237 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $128 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. On July 7, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.50 billion of the company’s common stock. At February 28, 2018, $500 million was available for future repurchases of the company’s common stock under this authorization. In January 2018, the company issued additional commercial paper obligations and used the proceeds and cash on hand to repay the $450 million principal balance of the 2.15% Senior Notes due 2018.As of December 31, 2017, the company’s short-term debt totaled $2.14 billion, including $960 million of commercial paper obligations and $1.17 billion of senior notes due within the next twelve months. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2017, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $77 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. A portion of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that are permanently reinvested and which the company plans to use to support continued growth plans outside of the U.S. through funding operations and other investment and growth opportunities. The majority of these funds are only available for use by the company's U.S. operations if they are repatriated into the U.S. The funds repatriated would be subject to additional state and foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation; however, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax liabilities that would be incurred. The company currently has no plans to repatriate these funds held by its non-U.S. subsidiaries.The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $1.34 billion as of December 31, 2017 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2016 Cash provided by operating activities was $3.26 billion during 2016. An increase in accounts receivable used cash of $352 million primarily to support growth in sales in local currencies and due to the mid-month timing of the acquisition of FEI when receivables are commonly lower than at quarter-end. Inventories provided cash of $98 million due to a reduction associated with fourth quarter 2016 sales. An increase in other assets used cash of $153 million primarily due to the timing of payments. An increase in other liabilities provided cash of $216 million primarily due to the timing of payments for income taxes and 37THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)incentive compensation. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $663 million during 2016, compared with $477 million in 2015. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $43 million during 2016. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $122 million during 2016.During 2016, the company’s investing activities used $5.52 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $5.18 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $444 million of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities provided $2.76 billion of cash during 2016. Issuance of senior notes and borrowings under term loans provided cash of $7.60 billion and an increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $904 million. Repayment of senior notes, the 364-day term loan and acquired debt used cash of $4.33 billion. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.25 billion of the company’s common stock and the payment of $238 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $87 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises.2015Cash provided by operating activities was $2.94 billion during 2015. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $149 million and $141 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales in local currencies. An increase in other assets used cash of $254 million primarily related to the timing of tax payments/refunds. An increase in other liabilities provided cash of $200 million primarily due to the timing of payments for income taxes and incentive compensation. Cash payments for income taxes decreased to $477 million during 2015, compared with $586 million in 2014 that included taxes associated with gains on divestitures. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $38 million during 2015. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $97 million during 2015.During 2015, the company’s investing activities used $1.09 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $695 million. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $423 million of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities used $2.62 billion of cash during 2015. Repayments of long-term debt totaled $3.79 billion. Issuance of senior notes provided cash of $1.80 billion and an increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $50 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $500 million of the company’s common stock and the payment of $241 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $72 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe company did not use special purpose entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2015, 2016 or 2017, except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, residual value guarantees under three lease agreements, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table or discussed below. The amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees relate to guarantees of the company’s performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business.38THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial CommitmentsThe table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the company’s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2017.

Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty.(c)Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company.Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.41 billion have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, other than those included in the above table, but expects that for 2018, such expenditures will be between $700 and $730 million.Guarantees of residual value under lease arrangements for three facilities have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantees may require payment (see Note 10). The residual value guarantees become operative at the end of the leases for up to a maximum of $155 million. The initial terms of these leases end in 2019, 2020 and 2022, although renewal options exist for each.A guarantee of pension plan obligations of a divested business has not been included in the preceding table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantee may require payment. The purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits, however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so. The amount of the guarantee at December 31, 2017 was $43 million.In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and related legal fees. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows.39THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business – Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, Norwegian kroner, Swiss franc and Canadian dollars. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements.Interest RatesThe company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2017, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2017 was $21.62 billion (see Note 12). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2017 would increase by approximately $1.30 billion. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2017 would decrease by approximately $1.20 billion.In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. In 2017, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the swap arrangements and variable-rate debt would have increased the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $44 million.Currency Exchange RatesThe company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in British pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, euro, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner and Swiss franc. The effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the ""accumulated other comprehensive items"" component of shareholders’ equity. The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2017 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $1.55 billion.The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2017 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $130 million. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2017 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $130 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2017 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $34 million on the company’s net income.40THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.",2023-12-30 17:37:59.116317

The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s continuing operations fall into four business segments (see Note 4): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services. Recent AcquisitionsThe company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. The company’s principal recent acquisitions are described below.On March 31, 2016, the company acquired, primarily within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Affymetrix, Inc., a North America-based provider of cellular and genetic analysis products, for a total purchase price of $1.34 billion, net of cash acquired, including the assumption of $254 million of debt. The acquisition expanded the company's existing portfolio of antibodies and assays for flow cytometry and single-cell biology applications. Additionally, the acquisition expanded the company's genetic analysis portfolio through the addition of microarrays. Revenues of Affymetrix were $360 million in 2015. On September 19, 2016, the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, FEI Company, a North America-based provider of high-performance electron microscopy, for a total purchase price of $4.08 billion, net of cash acquired. The acquisition strengthened the company's analytical instrument portfolio with the addition of high-end electron microscopes. Revenues of FEI were $930 million in 2015.On February 14, 2017, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Finesse Solutions, Inc., a North America-based developer of scalable control automation systems and software for bioproduction, for a total purchase price of $221 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition expanded the company's bioproduction offerings. Revenues of Finesse Solutions were approximately $50 million in 2016.On March 2, 2017, the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, Core Informatics, a North America-based provider of cloud-based platforms supporting scientific data management, for a total purchase price of $94 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition enhanced the company's existing informatics solutions. Revenues of Core Informatics were approximately $10 million in 2016. On August 29, 2017, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Patheon N.V., a leading global provider of high-quality drug development and delivery solutions to the pharmaceutical and biopharma sectors, for $35.00 per share in cash, or $7.36 billion, including the assumption of net debt. The company financed the purchase price, including the repayment of indebtedness of Patheon, with issuances of debt and equity. Patheon provides comprehensive, integrated and highly customizable solutions as well as the expertise to help biopharmaceutical companies of all sizes satisfy complex development and manufacturing needs. The acquisition provided entry into the pharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing organization market and added a complementary service to the company's existing pharmaceutical services portfolio. Patheon's revenues totaled $1.87 billion for the year ended October 31, 2016.On October 25, 2018, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Becton Dickinson and Company's Advanced Bioprocessing business for $477 million in cash. This North America-based business adds complementary cell culture products that expand the segment's bioproduction offerings to help customers increase yield during production of biologic drugs. Revenues of the Advanced Bioprocessing business were $100 million in 2017. 24THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of Results of Operations and Liquidity(Dollars in millions) 2018 2017 Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $6,269 25.7 % $5,728 27.4 %Analytical Instruments 5,469 22.5 % 4,821 23.0 %Specialty Diagnostics 3,724 15.3 % 3,486 16.7 %Laboratory Products and Services 10,035 41.2 % 7,825 37.4 %Eliminations (1,139) (4.7)% (942) (4.5)% $24,358 100 % $20,918 100 %Sales in 2018 were $24.36 billion, an increase of $3.44 billion from 2017. Sales increased $1.53 billion due to acquisitions. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $173 million in 2018. Aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $1.74 billion (8%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales to customers in each of the company's primary end markets grew. Sales growth was strong in each of the company's primary geographic areas, particularly Asia. In 2018, total company operating income and operating income margin were $3.78 billion and 15.5%, respectively, compared with $2.96 billion and 14.2%, respectively, in 2017. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, the effects of acquisitions and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by an increase in strategic growth investments, unfavorable sales mix and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, due to recent acquisitions. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. The company recorded a provision for income taxes in 2018 including a net provision of $68 million to adjust the estimated initial effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) recorded in 2017, consisting of an incremental provision of $117 million offset in part by a $49 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits established in 2017. These adjustments were required based on new U.S. Treasury guidance and further analysis of available tax accounting methods and elections, legislative updates, regulations, earnings and profit computations and foreign taxes. In 2018, the provision for income taxes also included a $71 million charge to establish a valuation allowance against net operating losses that will not be utilized as a result of the planned sale of the Anatomical Pathology business (Note 2). The company recorded a provision for income taxes in 2017 principally due to a net provision of $204 million from the effects of the Tax Act consisting primarily of a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, net of a benefit from adjusting the deferred tax balances for the U.S. statutory tax rate reduction. In 2017, the company refinanced certain long term inter-company debt which resulted in an income tax benefit of $237 million related to a foreign exchange loss recognized for income tax purposes. In addition, in 2017 the company recorded a $65 million favorable adjustment to deferred tax balances due to extension of a tax holiday agreement in Singapore. The company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries in 2017. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $86 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $53 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2017) for a net benefit of $33 million. The foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $20 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense.,The effective tax rate in both 2018 and 2017 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for 25THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued)income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $591 million and $479 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2019 will be between 7% and 10% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. Income from continuing operations increased to $2.94 billion in 2018, from $2.23 billion in 2017 principally due to increase in operating income in 2018 (discussed above).During 2018, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $4.54 billion compared with $4.01 billion for 2017. The increase primarily resulted from higher income before amortization and depreciation in the 2018 period, offset in part by higher investment in working capital to support sales growth.As of December 31, 2018, the company’s short-term debt totaled $1.27 billion, including $693 million of commercial paper obligations and $573 million of senior notes due within the next twelve months. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2018, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $82 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. The company expects to fund the acquisition of Gatan Inc. with a combination of existing cash balances and short-term borrowings. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $2.10 billion as of December 31, 2018 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, and pension costs. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:(a)Intangible Assets and GoodwillThe company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $13.71 billion at December 31, 2018. The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.26THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $25.35 billion and $1.27 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2018. Estimates of discounted future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, discount rates and other factors. For the goodwill impairment tests, the company considers peer revenues and earnings trading multiples from companies that have operational and financial characteristics that are similar to the respective reporting units and estimated weighted average costs of capital. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.For reporting units where the company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test, indications of fair value based on projections of profitability for 2019 and thereafter and on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2018, the date of the company’s impairment testing. There can be no assurance, however, that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary.With the completion of the Patheon acquisition in August 2017, the company established a new reporting unit, called Pharma Services, which solely consists of the legacy Patheon business, the book carrying value of which equaled its fair value as of the acquisition date. During its annual 2018 goodwill impairment assessment, the company determined that the Pharma Services reporting unit's cushion of fair value over book value had increased to 5%. Despite this favorable increase, given that the fair value of the reporting unit was not substantially in excess of its carrying value, relatively small decreases in future cash flows from anticipated results could result in impairment of goodwill. The key variables that drive the valuation of the reporting unit are revenue and operating income growth rate assumptions, peer revenue and earnings trading multiples, as well as the weighted average cost of capital rate applied. The estimates used for these assumptions represent management's best estimates, which the company believes are reasonable. These assumptions, however are subject to variability and uncertainty, including the degree to which the reporting unit will grow revenue and profitability levels. The Pharma Services reporting unit had $3.37 billion of goodwill, and an overall carrying value of $7.70 billion as of December 31, 2018.(b)Income TaxesIn the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. The company’s liability for these unrecognized tax benefits totaled $1.44 billion at December 31, 2018.The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income.27THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused. In situations in which the company has been able to conclude that its deferred tax assets will be realized, it has generally relied on future reversals of taxable temporary differences, expected future taxable income where such estimates have historically been reliable, and other factors. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $471 million at December 31, 2018. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary.The company has not provided state income or foreign withholding taxes on certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings, as such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the United States indefinitely in the respective jurisdictions based on specific business plans and tax strategies. These business plans and tax strategies consider: short-term and long-term forecasts and budgets of the U.S. parent and non-U.S. subsidiaries; working capital and other needs in locations where earnings are generated; the company’s past practices regarding non-U.S. subsidiary dividends; sources of financing by the U.S. parent, such as issuing debt or equity; and uses of cash by the U.S. parent that are more discretionary in nature, such as business combinations and share repurchase programs. However, should the company change its business plans and tax strategies in the future and decide to repatriate a portion of these earnings to one of its U.S. subsidiaries, including cash maintained by these non-U.S. subsidiaries, the company would recognize additional tax liabilities. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional state and foreign withholding tax liabilities that the company would incur. The company’s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax costs. (c)Contingencies and LitigationThe company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Accruals of acquired businesses, including product liability and environmental accruals, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.(d)Pension and Other Retiree BenefitsSeveral of the company’s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans. The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans’ measurement date. Net periodic pension costs for the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $22 million in 2018. The company’s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $391 million at year-end 2018 compared with $486 million at year-end 2017. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $93 million.28THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations2018 Compared With 2017 (In millions) 2018 2017 TotalChange CurrencyTranslation Acquisitions Operations Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $6,269 $5,728 $541 $49 $28 $464Analytical Instruments 5,469 4,821 648 41 45 562Specialty Diagnostics 3,724 3,486 238 41 8 189Laboratory Products and Services 10,035 7,825 2,210 50 1,466 694Eliminations (1,139) (942) (197) (8) (18) (171) Consolidated Revenues $24,358 $20,918 $3,440 $173 $1,529 $1,738Sales in 2018 were $24.36 billion, an increase of $3.44 billion from 2017. Sales increased $1.53 billion due to acquisitions. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $173 million in 2018. Aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $1.74 billion (8%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales to customers in each of the company's primary end markets grew. Sales growth was strong in each of the company's primary geographic areas, particularly Asia.In 2018, total company operating income and operating income margin were $3.78 billion and 15.5%, respectively, compared with $2.96 billion and 14.2%, respectively, in 2017. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, the effects of acquisitions and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by an increase in strategic growth investments, unfavorable sales mix and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, due to recent acquisitions.In 2018, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $91 million, including $12 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company recorded $29 million of net charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, principally third-party transaction and integration costs associated with recent and pending acquisitions, offset in part by income from the favorable results of product liability litigation. In addition, the company recorded $88 million of cash restructuring costs in its continuing effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the U.S. and Europe. The company also recorded $38 million of other income, net, principally for resolution of a litigation matter (see Note 15).In 2017, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $298 million, including $123 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, to conform the accounting policies of Patheon to the company's accounting policies; $78 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for third-party transaction and integration costs associated with recent acquisitions and changes in estimates of acquisition contingent consideration. In addition, the company recorded $97 million of cash restructuring costs, primarily to achieve acquisition synergies, including severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. and Europe. The company’s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The company also recorded $27 million of net credits for litigation-related matters, which were mostly offset by compensation due at Patheon on the date of acquisition, hurricane response/impairment costs, and net charges for the settlement/curtailment of retirement plans.As of February 27, 2019, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $65 million, primarily in 2019, and expects to identify additional actions during 2019 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements and abandonment of leased facilities. Approximately 40% of the additional charges will be incurred in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, 25% in the Analytical Instruments segment, 30% in the Laboratory Products and Services segment, and 5% in the Specialty Diagnostics segment. The restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2018 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately 29THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)$65 million beginning in part in 2018 and, to a greater extent, in 2019, including $20 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $10 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $5 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $30 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2017 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $90 million beginning in part in 2017 and to a greater extent in 2018, including $50 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $20 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $10 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $10 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.Segment ResultsThe company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 4). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.(Dollars in millions) 2018 2017 Change Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $6,269 $5,728 9%Analytical Instruments 5,469 4,821 13%Specialty Diagnostics 3,724 3,486 7%Laboratory Products and Services 10,035 7,825 28%Eliminations (1,139) (942) 21% Consolidated Revenues $24,358 $20,918 16% Segment Income Life Sciences Solutions $2,158 $1,894 14%Analytical Instruments 1,247 1,027 21%Specialty Diagnostics 952 927 3%Laboratory Products and Services 1,258 1,004 25% Subtotal Reportable Segments 5,615 4,852 16% Cost of Revenues Charges (12) (123) Selling, General and Administrative Charges, Net (29) (78) Restructuring and Other (Costs) Income, Net (50) (97) Amortization of Acquisition-related Intangible Assets (1,741) (1,594) Consolidated Operating Income $3,783 $2,960 28% Reportable Segments Operating Income Margin 23.1% 23.2% Consolidated Operating Income Margin 15.5% 14.2% Income from the company’s reportable segments increased 16% to $5.62 billion in 2018 due primarily to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, the effects of acquisitions, and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix.30THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)Life Sciences Solutions(Dollars in millions) 2018 2017 Change Revenues $6,269 $5,728 9% Operating Income Margin 34.4% 33.1% 1.3 ptSales in the Life Sciences Solutions segment increased $541 million to $6.27 billion in 2018. Sales increased $464 million (8%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses, $49 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation and $28 million due to acquisitions. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand at each of the segment's primary businesses, with particular strength from sales of biosciences products and bioprocess production products.Operating income margin was 34.4% in 2018 compared to 33.1% in 2017. The increase in operating margin resulted primarily from profit on higher sales and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. These increases were offset in part by unfavorable sales mix, and strategic growth investments.Analytical Instruments(Dollars in millions) 2018 2017 Change Revenues $5,469 $4,821 13% Operating Income Margin 22.8% 21.3% 1.5 ptSales in the Analytical Instruments segment increased $648 million to $5.47 billion in 2018.

Sales increased $189 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses, $41 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation and $8 million due to an acquisition. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was due to broad based higher demand in each of the segment's primary businesses with particular strength in sales of products sold through the segment’s healthcare market channel.Operating income margin was 25.6% in 2018 and 26.6% in 2017. The decrease resulted primarily from strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable sales mix, offset in part by profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, favorable foreign currency exchange.31THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)Laboratory Products and Services(Dollars in millions) 2018 2017 Change Revenues $10,035 $7,825 28% Operating Income Margin 12.5% 12.8% -0.3 ptSales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $2.21 billion to $10.04 billion in 2018. Sales increased $1.47 billion due to an acquisition, $694 million (9%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $50 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand in each of the segment's principal businesses with particular strength in its research and safety market channel business and its clinical trials business.Operating income margin was 12.5% in 2018 compared to 12.8% in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable sales mix and, to a lesser extent, strategic growth investments, offset in part by profit on higher sales.Other Expense, NetThe company reported other expense, net, of $521 million and $531 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively (Note 5). An increase in interest expense of $75 million was offset in part by an increase in interest income of $56 million in 2018. In 2017, other expense, net included $32 million of charges related to the amortization of fees paid to obtain bridge financing commitments related to the acquisition of Patheon.Provision for Income TaxesThe company recorded a provision for income taxes in 2018 including a net provision of $68 million to adjust the estimated initial effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 recorded in 2017, consisting of an incremental provision of $117 million offset in part by a $49 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits established in 2017. These adjustments were required based on new U.S. Treasury guidance and further analysis of available tax accounting methods and elections, legislative updates, regulations, earnings and profit computations and foreign taxes. In 2018, the provision for income taxes also included a $71 million charge to establish a valuation allowance against net operating losses that will not be utilized as a result of the planned sale of the Anatomical Pathology business (Note 2). The company recorded a provision for income taxes in 2017 principally due to a net provision of $204 million from the effects of the Tax Act consisting primarily of a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, net of a benefit from adjusting the deferred tax balances for the U.S. statutory tax rate reduction. In 2017, the company refinanced certain long term inter-company debt which resulted in an income tax benefit of $237 million related to a foreign exchange loss recognized for income tax purposes. In addition, in 2017 the company recorded a $65 million favorable adjustment to deferred tax balances due to extension of a tax holiday agreement in Singapore. The company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries in 2017. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $86 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $53 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2017) for a net benefit of $33 million. The foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $20 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense.The effective tax rate in both 2018 and 2017 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $591 million and $479 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.The company expects its effective tax rate in 2019 will be between 7% and 10% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events.32THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate.Recent Accounting PronouncementsA description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading ""Recent Accounting Pronouncements"" in Note 1.Contingent LiabilitiesThe company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the headings ""Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters,"" and ""Intellectual Property Matters"" in Note 11 could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.2017 Compared With 2016(In millions) 2017 2016 TotalChange CurrencyTranslation Acquisitions Operations Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $5,728 $5,317 $411 $12 $99 $300Analytical Instruments 4,821 3,668 1,153 29 794 330Specialty Diagnostics 3,486 3,339 147 12 9 126Laboratory Products and Services 7,825 6,724 1,101 13 727 361Eliminations (942) (774) (168) 4 (4) (168) Consolidated Revenues $20,918 $18,274 $2,644 $70 $1,625 $949Sales in 2017 were $20.92 billion, an increase of $2.64 billion from 2016.

Aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $949 million (5%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales to customers in each of the company's primary end markets grew.

The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales in local currencies, the effects of acquisitions and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by an increase in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, due to recent acquisitions, and strategic growth investments.In 2017, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $298 million, including $123 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, and, to a lesser extent, to conform the accounting policies of Patheon to the company's accounting policies. The company recorded $78 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily for third-party transaction and integration costs associated with recent acquisitions and changes in estimates of acquisition contingent consideration. In addition, the company recorded $97 million of cash restructuring costs, primarily to achieve acquisition synergies, including severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S and Europe. The company’s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The company also recorded $27 million of net credits for litigation-related matters, which were mostly offset by compensation due at Patheon on the date of the acquisition, hurricane response/impairment costs, and net charges for the settlement/curtailment of retirement plans (see Note 15).33THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)In 2016, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $395 million, including $102 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and to conform the accounting policies of FEI and Affymetrix to the company's accounting policies; $104 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for third-party transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions of FEI and Affymetrix. In addition, the company recorded $164 million of cash restructuring costs, primarily to achieve acquisition synergies, including severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. The company’s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The company also recorded charges for litigation and environmental remediation matters. These costs were partially offset by gains on the sales of real estate.The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2016 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $100 million beginning in part in 2016 and to a greater extent in 2017, including $60 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $25 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $5 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $10 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.Segment Results(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 Change Revenues Life Sciences Solutions $5,728 $5,317 8%Analytical Instruments 4,821 3,668 31%Specialty Diagnostics 3,486 3,339 4%Laboratory Products and Services 7,825 6,724 16%Eliminations (942) (774) 22% Consolidated Revenues $20,918 $18,274 14% Segment Income Life Sciences Solutions $1,894 $1,598 19%Analytical Instruments 1,027 749 37%Specialty Diagnostics 927 910 2%Laboratory Products and Services 1,004 974 3% Subtotal Reportable Segments 4,852 4,231 15% Cost of Revenues Charges (123) (102) Selling, General and Administrative Costs, Net (78) (104) Restructuring and Other Income (Costs), Net (97) (189) Amortization of Acquisition-related Intangible Assets (1,594) (1,378) Consolidated Operating Income $2,960 $2,458 20% Reportable Segments Operating Income Margin 23.2% 23.2% Consolidated Operating Income Margin 14.2% 13.5% Income from the company’s reportable segments increased 15% to $4.85 billion in 2017 due primarily to profit on higher sales in local currencies, the effects of acquisitions and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by strategic growth investments.34THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)Life Sciences Solutions(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 Change Revenues $5,728 $5,317 8% Operating Income Margin 33.1% 30.1% 3.0 ptSales in the Life Sciences Solutions segment increased $411 million to $5.73 billion in 2017. Sales increased $300 million (6%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses, $99 million due to acquisitions and $12 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for biosciences products and, to a lesser extent, bioprocess production products as well as genetic sciences products.Operating income margin was 33.1% in 2017 compared to 30.1% in 2016. The increase in operating margin resulted primarily from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and, to a lesser extent, profit on higher sales in local currencies and price increases. These increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments and acquisition dilution.Analytical Instruments(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 Change Revenues $4,821 $3,668 31% Operating Income Margin 21.3% 20.4% 0.9 ptSales in the Analytical Instruments segment increased $1.15 billion to $4.82 billion in 2017. Sales increased $794 million due to acquisitions, $330 million (9%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $29 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand in each of the segment's primary businesses particularly products sold by the segment's chromatography and mass spectrometry business and materials and structural analysis business.Operating income margin was 21.3% in 2017 compared to 20.4% in 2016. The increase resulted primarily from profit on higher sales in local currencies, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, the effect of acquisitions, offset in part by strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and unfavorable sales mix. Specialty Diagnostics(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 Change Revenues $3,486 $3,339 4% Operating Income Margin 26.6% 27.3% -0.7 ptSales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $147 million to $3.49 billion in 2017. Sales increased $126 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses, $12 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation and $9 million due to acquisitions. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to higher demand for products sold through the segment's healthcare market channel as well as clinical diagnostics products and immunodiagnostics products.Operating income margin was 26.6% in 2017 and 27.3% in 2016. The decrease resulted primarily from strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable sales mix, offset in part by profit on higher sales in local currencies and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.35THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)Laboratory Products and Services(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 Change Revenues $7,825 $6,724 16% Operating Income Margin 12.8% 14.5% -1.7 ptSales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $1.10 billion to $7.83 billion in 2017. Sales increased $727 million due to acquisitions, $361 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $13 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation. The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for products sold through the segment's channel business and, to a lesser extent, laboratory equipment and consumables.Operating income margin was 12.8% in 2017 compared to 14.5% in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable sales mix and strategic growth investments offset in part by profit on higher sales in local currencies and, to a lesser extent, the effect of acquisitions.Other Expense, NetThe company reported other expense, net, of $531 million and $434 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively (Note 5). Interest expense increased $123 million, primarily due to an increase in outstanding debt. Provision for Income TaxesThe company recorded a provision for income taxes in 2017 principally due to a net provision of $204 million from the effects of the Tax Act consisting primarily of a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, net of a benefit from adjusting the deferred tax balances for the U.S. statutory tax rate reduction. In 2017, the company refinanced certain long term inter-company debt which resulted in an income tax benefit of $237 million related to a foreign exchange loss recognized for income tax purposes. In addition, in 2017 the company recorded a $65 million favorable adjustment to deferred tax balances due to extension of a tax holiday agreement in Singapore. The company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries in 2017. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $86 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $53 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2017) for a net benefit of $33 million. The foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned. The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $20 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. The company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2016. In 2016, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries. These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company’s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost. As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $91 million, offset in part by additional U.S. taxes of $37 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2016) for a net benefit of $54 million. The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $100 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense. In addition, the company recorded discrete benefits in 2016 totaling $39 million related to prior year tax filings and net charges of $12 million related to tax audits. The effective tax rate in both 2017 and 2016 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $479 million and $663 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesConsolidated working capital was $4.48 billion at December 31, 2018, compared with $2.37 billion at December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher cash and lower short-term debt. Included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $2.10 billion at December 31, 2018 and $1.34 billion at December 31, 2017.36THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)2018 Cash provided by operating activities was $4.54 billion during 2018. Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $366 million and $324 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $591 million during 2018, compared with $479 million in 2017. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $93 million during 2018. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $83 million during 2018.During 2018, the company’s investing activities used $1.25 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $536 million. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $758 million of property, plant and equipment. On January 28, 2019, the company entered into an agreement to sell its Anatomical Pathology business to PHC Holdings Corporation for approximately $1.14 billion. The sale is subject to customary closing conditions and applicable regulatory approvals. The company’s financing activities used $2.24 billion of cash during 2018. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $2.05 billion. New long-term borrowings provided cash of $690 million. A net decrease in commercial paper obligations used cash of $194 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $500 million of the company’s common stock and the payment of $266 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $136 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. On July 7, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.50 billion of the company’s common stock. In 2018, the company repurchased $500 million of the company's common stock, depleting the 2016 authorization. On September 7, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.00 billion of the company’s common stock. In January 2019, the company repurchased $750 million of the company's common stock. At February 27, 2019, authorization remained for $1.25 billion of future repurchases of the company’s common stock.As of December 31, 2018, the company’s short-term debt totaled $1.27 billion, including $693 million of commercial paper obligations and $573 million of senior notes due within the next twelve months. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2018, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $82 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the U.S. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company expects to fund the acquisition of Gatan Inc. with a combination of existing cash balances and short-term borrowings. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $2.10 billion as of December 31, 2018 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2017 Cash provided by operating activities was $4.01 billion during 2017. An increase in other liabilities provided cash of $1.02 billion primarily due to the Tax Act's one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries. Given the availability of foreign tax credits, the company does not expect the transition tax to result in significant cash requirements. An increase in accounts payable provided cash of $274 million due to the timing of payments. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $362 million and $81 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales in local currencies. An increase in other assets used cash of $153 million primarily due to the timing of income tax refunds. Cash payments for income taxes decreased to $479 million during 2017, compared with $663 million in 2016. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $200 million during 2017. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $93 million during 2017.37THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)During 2017, the company’s investing activities used $7.73 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $7.23 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $508 million of property, plant and equipment.The company’s financing activities provided $3.85 billion of cash during 2017. Issuance of senior notes and borrowings under a term loan provided cash of $6.46 billion. The company also issued 10 million shares of its common stock for net proceeds of $1.69 billion. Repayment of senior notes and term loans used cash of $3.30 billion and a net decrease in commercial paper obligations used cash of $134 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $750 million of the company’s common stock and the payment of $237 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $128 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises.2016Cash provided by operating activities was $3.26 billion during 2016. An increase in accounts receivable used cash of $352 million primarily to support growth in sales in local currencies and due to the mid-month timing of the acquisition of FEI when receivables are commonly lower than at quarter-end. Inventories provided cash of $98 million due to a reduction associated with fourth quarter 2016 sales. An increase in other assets used cash of $153 million primarily due to the timing of payments. An increase in other liabilities provided cash of $216 million primarily due to the timing of payments for income taxes and incentive compensation. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $663 million during 2016, compared with $477 million in 2015. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $43 million during 2016. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $122 million during 2016.During 2016, the company’s investing activities used $5.52 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $5.18 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $444 million of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities provided $2.76 billion of cash during 2016. Issuance of senior notes and borrowings under term loans provided cash of $7.60 billion and an increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $904 million. Repayment of senior notes, the 364-day term loan and acquired debt used cash of $4.33 billion. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.25 billion of the company’s common stock and the payment of $238 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $87 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe company did not use special purpose entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2016, 2017 or 2018, except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, residual value guarantees under three lease agreements, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table or discussed below. The amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees relate to guarantees of the company’s performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business.38THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial CommitmentsThe table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the company’s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018.

Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty.The contractual obligation at December 31, 2018 to acquire Gatan Inc. for approximately $925 million has been omitted from the above table. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.44 billion have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, other than those included in the above table, but expects that for 2019, such expenditures will be between $800 and $850 million.Guarantees of residual value under lease arrangements for three facilities have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantees may require payment (see Note 11). The residual value guarantees become operative at the end of the leases for up to a maximum of $147 million. The initial terms of these leases end in 2019, 2020 and 2023, although renewal options exist for each.A guarantee of pension plan obligations of a divested business has not been included in the preceding table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantee may require payment. The purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits, however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so. The amount of the guarantee at December 31, 2018 was $38 million.In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and related legal fees. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows.39THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business – Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Norwegian kroner, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen and Swedish kronor. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements.Interest RatesThe company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2018, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2018 was $19.04 billion (see Note 13). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2018 would increase by approximately $1.06 billion. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2018 would decrease by approximately $0.98 billion.In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. In 2018, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the swap arrangements and variable-rate debt would have increased the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $43 million.Currency Exchange RatesThe company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in British pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, euro, Canadian dollars, Swiss franc, Norwegian kroner and Danish kroner. The effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the ""accumulated other comprehensive items"" component of shareholders’ equity. The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2018 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $0.84 billion.The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2018 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an additional unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $145 million. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2018 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $138 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2018 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $25 million on the company’s net income.40THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.",2023-12-30 17:37:57.729193

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsReference is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for 2017 is included in Item 7 of the company’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. OverviewThe company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s operations fall into four segments (see Note 4): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services. Recent Acquisitions and DivestitureThe company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. The company’s principal recent acquisitions and divestiture are described below.On October 25, 2018, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Becton Dickinson and Company's Advanced Bioprocessing business for $477 million in cash. This North America-based business adds complementary cell culture products that expand the segment’s bioproduction offerings to help customers increase yield during production of biologic drugs. The Advanced Bioprocessing business reported revenues of $100 million in 2017. On April 30, 2019, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Brammer Bio for approximately $1.67 billion in cash. Brammer Bio is a leading viral vector contract development and manufacturing organization for gene and cell therapies. The acquisition expands the segment’s contract manufacturing capabilities. Brammer Bio reported revenues of approximately $140 million in 2018. On June 28, 2019, the company sold its Anatomical Pathology business to PHC Holdings Corporation for $1.13 billion, net of cash divested. The business was part of the Specialty Diagnostics segment. The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $478 million, included in restructuring and other (income) costs, net. Revenues in 2019, through the date of sale, and the full year 2018 of the business sold were approximately $115 million and $238 million, respectively, net of retained sales through the company's healthcare market and research and safety market channel businesses.

Sales increased $153 million due to acquisitions, net of a divestiture. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $440 million in 2019. Aside from the effects of acquisitions/divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $1.47 billion (6%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales to customers in each of the company’s primary end markets grew with particular strength in sales to customers in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry. Sales growth was strong in each of the company’s primary geographic areas in 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2019, sales to industrial customers declined and sales growth in Asia was modest due to weaker end market conditions off of a strong fourth quarter in 2018. 23THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued)In 2019, total company operating income and operating income margin were $4.59 billion and 18.0%, respectively, compared with $3.78 billion and 15.5%, respectively, in 2018. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales, the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. These increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments, sales mix and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. The company recorded a $374 million provision for income taxes in 2019 including $191 million related to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. In 2019, the company recorded a $62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements, implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense, and recorded a $79 million income tax benefit related to the deferred tax implications of intra-entity transactions which included a tax benefit to release a valuation allowance against net operating losses previously determined to be unrealizable.The company recorded a $324 million provision for income taxes in 2018 including a net provision of $68 million to adjust the estimated initial effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) recorded in 2017, consisting of an incremental provision of $117 million offset in part by a $49 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits established in 2017. These adjustments were required based on new U.S. Treasury guidance and further analysis of available tax accounting methods and elections, legislative updates, regulations, earnings and profit computations and foreign taxes. In 2018, the provision for income taxes also included a $71 million charge to establish a valuation allowance against net operating losses that will not be utilized as a result of the 2019 sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. The effective tax rate in both 2019 and 2018 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $896 million and $591 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2020 will be between 8% and 10% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. Income from continuing operations increased to $3.70 billion in 2019, from $2.94 billion in 2018 principally due to increase in operating income in 2019 (discussed above) offset in part by $184 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt in 2019 (Note 10).During 2019, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $4.97 billion compared with $4.54 billion for 2018. The increase primarily resulted from higher income before amortization and depreciation and lower investment in working capital in the 2019 period.As of December 31, 2019, the company’s short-term debt totaled $676 million, including $672 million of senior notes due within the next twelve months. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2019, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $72 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $2.40 billion as of December 31, 2019 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 24THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes and contingencies and litigation. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:(a)Intangible Assets and GoodwillThe company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $12.76 billion at December 31, 2019. The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $25.71 billion and $1.25 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2019. Estimates of discounted future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth rates, discount rates and other factors. For the goodwill impairment tests, the company considers (i) peer revenues and earnings trading multiples from companies that have operational and financial characteristics that are similar to the respective reporting units and (ii) estimated weighted average costs of capital. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.For reporting units where the company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test, indications of fair value based on projections of profitability and on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2019, the date of the company’s annual impairment testing. There can be no assurance, however, that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary.(b)Income TaxesIn the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax 25THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. The company’s liability for these unrecognized tax benefits totaled $1.55 billion at December 31, 2019.The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the company to interpret the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income.The company estimates the degree to which tax assets will result in a benefit, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets that it believes will more likely than not go unused. In situations in which the company has been able to determine that its deferred tax assets will be realized, that determination generally relies on future reversals of taxable temporary differences and expected future taxable income. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $408 million at December 31, 2019. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary.The company has not provided U.S. state income taxes or additional non-U.S. taxes on certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings, as such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the United States indefinitely in the respective jurisdictions based on specific business plans and tax strategies. These business plans and tax strategies consider: short-term and long-term forecasts and budgets of the U.S. parent and non-U.S. subsidiaries; working capital and other needs in locations where earnings are generated; the company’s past practices regarding non-U.S. subsidiary dividends; sources of financing by the U.S. parent, such as issuing debt or equity; and uses of cash by the U.S. parent that are more discretionary in nature, such as business combinations and share repurchase programs. However, should the company change its business plans and tax strategies in the future and decide to repatriate a portion of these earnings to one of its U.S. subsidiaries, including cash maintained by these non-U.S. subsidiaries, the company would recognize additional tax liabilities. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional U.S. state income tax and non-U.S. tax liabilities that the company would incur. The company’s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax costs. (c)Contingencies and LitigationThe company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Accruals of acquired businesses, including product liability and environmental accruals, are initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.26THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations2019 Compared With 2018 (In millions)20192018TotalChangeCurrencyTranslation / Other *Acquisitions/DivestituresOperationsRevenues Life Sciences Solutions$6,856 $6,269 $587 $(122) $89 $620 Analytical Instruments5,522 5,469 53 (96) — 149 Specialty Diagnostics3,718 3,724 (6) (66) (126) 186 Laboratory Products and Services10,599 10,035 564 (227) 187 604 Eliminations(1,153) (1,139) (14) 71 3 (88) Consolidated Revenues$25,542 $24,358 $1,184 $(440) $153 $1,471 * Currency Translation/Other for the Laboratory Products and Services segment includes a reduction of revenue of $60 million for the impact of a change in the method of reporting certain intersegment sales with no impact on consolidated results.Sales in 2019 were $25.54 billion, an increase of $1.18 billion from 2018. Sales increased $153 million due to acquisitions. The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $440 million in 2019. Aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $1.47 billion (6%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales to customers in each of the company’s primary end markets grew with particular strength in sales to customers in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry. Sales growth was strong in each of the company’s primary geographic areas in 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2019, sales to industrial customers declined and sales growth in Asia was modest due to weaker end market conditions off of a strong fourth quarter in 2018.In 2019, total company operating income and operating income margin were $4.59 billion and 18.0%, respectively, compared with $3.78 billion and 15.5%, respectively, in 2018. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales, the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases. These increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments, sales mix and unfavorable foreign currency exchange.In 2019, the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $334 million, including $482 million of net gains on the sale of businesses, principally the Anatomical Pathology business (see Note 2). The company also recorded $17 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, and $62 million of net charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, principally transaction and integration-related costs related to acquisitions and a divestiture. In addition, the company recorded $52 million of cash restructuring charges, net, primarily for employee severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S. and Europe (see Note 16).In 2018, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $91 million, including $12 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition. The company recorded $29 million of net charges to selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily for third-party transaction and integration costs associated with recent and pending acquisitions, offset in part by income from favorable results of product liability litigation. In addition, the company recorded $88 million of cash restructuring costs, in its continued effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the U.S. and Europe. The company also recorded $38 million of other income, net, principally for resolution of a litigation matter.As of February 26, 2020, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $65 million, primarily in 2020, and expects to identify additional actions during 2020 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements or when the costs have been incurred. Approximately 25% of the additional charges will be incurred in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, 30% in the Analytical Instruments segment, 35% in the Laboratory Products and Services segment, and 10% in the Specialty Diagnostics segment. The restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2019 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $60 million beginning in part in 2019 and, to a greater extent, in 2020, including $20 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $15 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $5 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $20 27THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2018 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $65 million beginning in part in 2018 and to a greater extent in 2019, including $20 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $10 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $5 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $30 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.Segment ResultsThe company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 4).

Increases from profit on higher sales and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, were offset by strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, sales mix.Other Expense/Income, NetIn 2019, the company recorded $184 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt, offset in part by $44 million of net gains on investments. The investment gains include a $28 million gain on the sale of a joint venture for net proceeds of $42 million. In 2018, the company recorded $15 million of net losses on investments.Provision for Income TaxesThe company recorded a $374 million provision for income taxes in 2019 including $191 million related to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. In 2019, the company recorded a $62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements, implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense, and recorded a $79 million income tax benefit related to the deferred tax implications of intra-entity transactions which included a tax benefit to release a valuation allowance against net operating losses previously determined to be unrealizable.The company recorded a $324 million provision for income taxes in 2018 including a net provision of $68 million to adjust the estimated initial effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 recorded in 2017, consisting of an incremental provision of $117 million offset in part by a $49 million reduction of related unrecognized tax benefits established in 2017. These adjustments were required based on new U.S. Treasury guidance and further analysis of available tax accounting methods and elections, legislative updates, regulations, earnings and profit computations and foreign taxes. In 2018, the provision for income taxes also included a $71 million charge to establish a valuation allowance against net operating losses that will not be utilized as a result of the 2019 sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. The effective tax rate in both 2019 and 2018 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $896 million and $591 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2020 will be between 8% and 10% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events.The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate.Recent Accounting PronouncementsA description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1.Contingent LiabilitiesThe company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the headings “Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters,” and “Intellectual Property Matters” in Note 12 could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.30THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital ResourcesConsolidated working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $5.70 billion at December 31, 2019, compared with $4.48 billion at December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower short-term debt and higher cash balances. Included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $2.40 billion at December 31, 2019 and $2.10 billion at December 31, 2018.2019 Cash provided by operating activities was $4.97 billion during 2019. Cash provided by income was offset in part by increased investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $225 million and $458 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. An increase in other assets used cash of $408 million primarily due to the timing of customer billings and tax refunds. Other liabilities increased by $210 million primarily due to advance payments from customers. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $896 million during 2019, compared with $591 million in 2018. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $50 million during 2019. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $69 million during 2019.During 2019, the company’s investing activities used $1.49 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $1.84 billion. Proceeds from the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business provided $1.13 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $926 million of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities used $3.12 billion of cash during 2019. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $6.36 billion. New long-term borrowings provided cash of $5.64 billion. A net decrease in commercial paper obligations used cash of $683 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company’s common stock and the payment of $297 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $153 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. On November 8, 2019, the Board of Directors replaced the existing authorization to repurchase the company’s common stock, of which $500 million was remaining, with a new authorization to repurchase up to $2.50 billion of the company’s common stock. At February 26, 2020, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company’s common stock.As of December 31, 2019, the company’s short-term debt totaled $676 million, including $672 million of senior notes due within the next twelve months. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit. If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2019, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $72 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the U.S. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $2.40 billion as of December 31, 2019 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. 2018 Cash provided by operating activities was $4.54 billion during 2018. Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $366 million and $324 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $591 million during 2018, compared with $479 million in 2017. The company made cash contributions to its pension and postretirement benefit plans totaling $93 million during 2018. Payments for restructuring actions, principally severance costs and lease and other expenses of real estate consolidation, used cash of $83 million during 2018.During 2018, the company’s investing activities used $1.25 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $536 million. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $758 million of property, plant and equipment. 31THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)The company’s financing activities used $2.24 billion of cash during 2018. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $2.05 billion. New long-term borrowings provided cash of $690 million. A net decrease in commercial paper obligations used cash of $194 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $500 million of the company’s common stock and the payment of $266 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $136 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe company did not use special purpose entities or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements in 2017, 2018 or 2019, except for letters of credit, bank guarantees, residual value guarantees under three lease agreements, surety bonds and other guarantees disclosed in the table or discussed below. The amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees relate to guarantees of the company’s performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business.Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial CommitmentsThe table below summarizes, by period due or expiration of commitment, the company’s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2019.

Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty.Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.55 billion have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions. The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, other than those included in the above table, but expects that for 2020, such expenditures will be between $1 and $1.1 billion.Guarantees of residual value under lease arrangements for three facilities have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantees may require payment (see Note 11). The residual value guarantees become operative at the end of the leases for up to a maximum of $147 million. The terms of these leases end in 2020, 2023 and 2024.A guarantee of pension plan obligations of a divested business has not been included in the preceding table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantee may require payment. The purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits, however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so. The amount of the guarantee at December 31, 2019 was $41 million.32THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and related legal fees. The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows.The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Item 1. Business – Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Swiss franc, euro, Canadian dollars, Swedish kronor, British pounds sterling, Japanese yen and Czech koruna. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements.Interest RatesThe company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2019, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2019 was $18.67 billion (see Note 14). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2019 would increase by approximately $1.49 billion. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2019 would decrease by approximately $1.50 billion.In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. In 2019, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the swap arrangements and variable-rate debt would have increased the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $16 million.Currency Exchange RatesThe company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in British pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, euro, Canadian dollars, Swiss franc, Norwegian kroner and Danish kroner. The effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2019 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of $1.14 billion.The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2019 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an additional unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $243 million. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2019 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $203 million. The 33THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued)unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2019 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $32 million on the company’s net income.",2023-12-30 17:37:12.392274
97745,TMO,THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.,2021,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsReference is made throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for 2018 is included in Item 7 of the company’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. OverviewThe company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide. The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses. The company’s operations fall into four segments (Note 4): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services. The company mobilized in early 2020 to support the COVID-19 pandemic response with products and services that help analyze, diagnose and protect from the virus. However, the company saw a significant reduction in customer activity in several businesses by late March 2020 that materially adversely affected primarily the 2020 results of the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the company’s other three segments. The extent and duration of the negative impacts continuing into 2021 are uncertain and dependent in part on the success of global efforts to control the pandemic and economic activity ramping up. The company believes the impacted businesses’ long-term prospects remain excellent given the company’s attractive markets served, its industry-leading position and proven growth strategy. Several of the company’s businesses have had a significant increase in revenues due to sales of product and services addressing diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, including test kits and, to a lesser extent, products and services for therapy and vaccine development and manufacturing. While these positive impacts are expected to continue into 2021, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing demand. Recent Acquisitions and DivestitureThe company’s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. The company’s principal recent acquisitions and divestitures are described below.On April 30, 2019, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Brammer Bio for approximately $1.67 billion in cash. Brammer Bio is a leading viral vector contract development and manufacturing organization for gene and cell therapies. The acquisition expanded the segment’s contract manufacturing capabilities. Brammer Bio reported revenues of approximately $140 million in 2018.On June 28, 2019, the company sold its Anatomical Pathology business to PHC Holdings Corporation for $1.13 billion, net of cash divested. The business was part of the Specialty Diagnostics segment. Revenues in 2019, through the date of sale, and the full year 2018 of the business sold were approximately $115 million and $238 million, respectively, net of retained sales through the company's healthcare market and research and safety market channel businesses.

Sales increased $78 million due to acquisitions, net of a divestiture. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $133 million in 2020. 24THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued)Aside from the effects of acquisitions/divestitures and currency translation, revenues increased $6.47 billion (25%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales of products that address COVID-19 testing and treatment totaled $6.63 billion in 2020, and were offset in part by lower revenues in the remainder of the business during the first half of 2020. Sales were particularly strong in diagnostic and healthcare markets, due to demand for products supporting customers diagnosing the COVID-19 virus, offset in part by lower sales of other products due to pandemic-related impacts on customer activity. Sales were also strong to customers in pharma and biotech markets where demand was strong for products and services and pandemic-related demand for therapies and vaccines also contributed to growth. Sales to customers in industrial markets decreased primarily due to lower demand from weakened economic conditions related to COVID-19. Sales to these customers returned to positive growth in the fourth quarter of 2020. Sales to academic and government customers decreased due primarily to closure of academic labs during the global pandemic. Sales to these customers returned to positive growth in the third quarter of 2020. Sales growth was particularly strong in North America and Europe and, to a lesser extent, in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2020, total company operating income and operating income margin were $7.79 billion and 24.2%, respectively, compared with $4.59 billion and 18.0%, respectively, in 2019. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, sales mix, offset in part by a gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business included in the 2019 period and strategic growth investments in 2020. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, focused research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. Productivity improvements are calculated net of inflationary cost increases. The company recorded a provision for income taxes of $850 million in 2020 (effective tax rate of 11.8%). In 2020, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $96 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense and also recorded a net income tax benefit of $51 million from a domestication transaction involving the transfer of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the U.S.; a $47 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements; and a $27 million tax benefit from tax audit settlements.The company recorded a provision for income taxes of $374 million in 2019 (effective tax rate of 9.2%) including $191 million related to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. In 2019, the company recorded a $62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements; implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense; and recorded a $79 million income tax benefit related to the deferred tax implications of intra-entity transactions which included a tax benefit to release a valuation allowance against net operating losses previously determined to be unrealizable. The effective tax rate in both 2020 and 2019 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $1.32 billion and $0.90 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2021 will be between 11% and 13% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. Net income increased to $6.38 billion in 2020, from $3.70 billion in 2019 principally due to the increase in operating income in 2020 (discussed above) offset in part by the increase in the income tax provision.During 2020, the company’s cash flow from operations totaled $8.29 billion compared with $4.97 billion for 2019. The increase primarily resulted from higher cash provided by income and, to a lesser extent, lower investment in working capital in 2020.As of December 31, 2020, the company’s short-term debt totaled $2.63 billion, substantially all of which was redeemed in January 2021. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $3.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (Note 10). If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount 25THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview of Results of Operations and Liquidity (continued)equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $31 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $10.33 billion as of December 31, 2020 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes and contingencies and litigation. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:(a)Intangible Assets and GoodwillThe company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $11.45 billion at December 31, 2020. The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $26.04 billion and $1.24 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2020. Estimates of discounted future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth rates, discount rates and other factors. For the goodwill impairment tests, the company considers (i) peer revenues and earnings trading multiples from companies that have operational and financial characteristics that are similar to the respective reporting units and (ii) estimated weighted average costs of capital. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.The company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for all of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Indications of fair value based on projections of profitability and on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2020, the date of the company’s annual impairment testing. There can be no assurance, however, that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the 26THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary.(b)Income TaxesIn the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. The company’s liability for these unrecognized tax benefits totaled $1.09 billion at December 31, 2020.The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the company to interpret the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income.The company estimates the degree to which tax assets will result in a benefit, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets that it believes will more likely than not go unused. In situations in which the company has been able to determine that its deferred tax assets will be realized, that determination generally relies on future reversals of taxable temporary differences and expected future taxable income. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $933 million at December 31, 2020. Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary.The company has not provided U.S. state income taxes or additional non-U.S. taxes on certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings, as such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the United States indefinitely in the respective jurisdictions based on specific business plans and tax strategies. These business plans and tax strategies consider: short-term and long-term forecasts and budgets of the U.S. parent and non-U.S. subsidiaries; working capital and other needs in locations where earnings are generated; the company’s past practices regarding non-U.S. subsidiary dividends; sources of financing by the U.S. parent, such as issuing debt or equity; and uses of cash by the U.S. parent that are more discretionary in nature, such as business combinations and share repurchase programs. However, should the company change its business plans and tax strategies in the future and decide to repatriate a portion of these earnings to one of its U.S. subsidiaries, including cash maintained by these non-U.S. subsidiaries, the company would recognize additional tax liabilities. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional U.S. state income tax and non-U.S. tax liabilities that the company would incur. The company’s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax costs. (c)Contingencies and LitigationThe company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers’ compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Accruals of acquired businesses, including product liability and environmental accruals, are initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.27THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations2020 Compared With 2019 (In millions)20202019TotalChangeCurrencyTranslationAcquisitions/DivestituresOperationsRevenues Life Sciences Solutions$12,168 $6,856 $5,312 $29 $— $5,283 Analytical Instruments5,124 5,522 (398)39 — (437)Specialty Diagnostics5,343 3,718 1,625 14 (121)1,732 Laboratory Products and Services12,245 10,599 1,646 52 184 1,410 Eliminations(2,662)(1,153)(1,509)(1)15 (1,523)Consolidated Revenues$32,218 $25,542 $6,676 $133 $78 $6,465 Sales in 2020 were $32.22 billion, an increase of $6.68 billion from 2019. Sales increased $78 million due to acquisitions, net of a divestiture. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $133 million in 2020. Aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $6.47 billion (25%) primarily due to increased demand. Sales of products that address COVID-19 testing and treatment totaled $6.63 billion in 2020, and were offset in part by lower revenues in the remainder of the business during the first half of 2020. Sales were particularly strong in diagnostic and healthcare markets, due to demand for products supporting customers diagnosing the COVID-19 virus, offset in part by lower sales of other products due to pandemic-related impacts on customer activity. Sales were also strong to customers in pharma and biotech markets where demand was strong for products and services and pandemic-related demand for therapies and vaccines also contributed to growth. Sales to customers in industrial markets decreased primarily due to lower demand from weakened economic conditions related to COVID-19. Sales to these customers returned to positive growth in the fourth quarter of 2020. Sales to academic and government customers decreased due primarily to closure of academic labs during the global pandemic. Sales to these customers returned to positive growth in the third quarter of 2020. Sales growth was particularly strong in North America and Europe and, to a lesser extent, in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2020, total company operating income and operating income margin were $7.79 billion and 24.2%, respectively, compared with $4.59 billion and 18.0%, respectively, in 2019. The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, sales mix, offset in part by a gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business included in the 2019 period and strategic growth investments in 2020.In 2020, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $95 million (Note 16). In 2019, the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $334 million, including $482 million of net gains on the sale of businesses, principally the Anatomical Pathology business (Note 2). The restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2020 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $55 million beginning in part in 2020 and, to a greater extent, in 2021. The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2019 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $60 million beginning in part in 2019 and to a greater extent in 2020.Segment ResultsThe company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments’ core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 4). Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.28THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)(Dollars in millions)20202019ChangeRevenuesLife Sciences Solutions$12,168 $6,856 77 %Analytical Instruments5,124 5,522 (7)%Specialty Diagnostics5,343 3,718 44 %Laboratory Products and Services12,245 10,599 16 %Eliminations(2,662)(1,153)131 %Consolidated Revenues$32,218 $25,542 26 %Segment IncomeLife Sciences Solutions$6,109 $2,446 150 %Analytical Instruments808 1,273 (37)%Specialty Diagnostics1,368 930 47 %Laboratory Products and Services1,271 1,324 (4)%Subtotal Reportable Segments9,556 5,973 60 %Cost of Revenues Charges(6)(17)Selling, General and Administrative Charges, Net10 (62)Restructuring and Other (Costs) Income, Net(99)413 Amortization of Acquisition-related Intangible Assets(1,667)(1,713)Consolidated Operating Income$7,794 $4,594 70 %Reportable Segments Income Margin29.7 %23.4 %Consolidated Operating Income Margin24.2 %18.0 %Income from the company’s reportable segments increased 60% to $9.56 billion in 2020 due primarily to profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, sales mix, offset in part by strategic growth investments.Life Sciences Solutions(Dollars in millions)20202019ChangeRevenues$12,168 $6,856 77 %Operating Income Margin50.2 %35.7 %14.5 ptSales in the Life Sciences Solutions segment increased $5.31 billion to $12.17 billion in 2020. Sales increased $5.28 billion (77%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $29 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was primarily driven by demand for testing to diagnose COVID-19 with higher sales of genetic sciences products and, to a lesser extent, bioscience products. Sales also grew due to higher demand for bioproduction products. Operating income margin was 50.2% in 2020 compared to 35.7% in 2019. The increase resulted primarily from profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, sales mix, offset in part by strategic growth investments.Analytical Instruments(Dollars in millions)20202019ChangeRevenues$5,124 $5,522 (7)%Operating Income Margin15.8 %23.1 %-7.3 pt29THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)Sales in the Analytical Instruments segment decreased $398 million to $5.12 billion in 2020. Sales decreased $437 million (-8%) due to lower revenues at existing businesses. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $39 million. The decrease in revenues at existing businesses was primarily the result of reduced demand from industrial customers following business slowing and closures due to COVID-19 and lower sales to academic customers due to pandemic-related closures. The segment returned to positive growth in the fourth quarter of 2020.Operating income margin was 15.8% in 2020 compared to 23.1% in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to sales mix, the decrease in sales, a $108 million charge related to a long-term supply contract (discussed in Note 12), and, to a lesser extent, strategic growth investments, offset in part by productivity improvements. Specialty Diagnostics(Dollars in millions)20202019ChangeRevenues$5,343 $3,718 44 %Operating Income Margin25.6 %25.0 %0.6 ptSales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $1.63 billion to $5.34 billion in 2020. Sales increased $1.73 billion (48%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $14 million and the divestiture of the Anatomical Pathology business in June 2019 decreased revenues by $121 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was due to higher demand primarily driven by products addressing treatment of COVID-19, with particular strength in sales of products sold through the segment's healthcare market channel business, and to a lesser extent, microbiology and clinical diagnostics products. These increases were offset in part by lower sales in some of the segment’s businesses due to pandemic-related reductions in demand. Operating income margin was 25.6% in 2020 and 25.0% in 2019. The increase was primarily due to profit on higher sales, offset in part by sales mix and, to a lesser extent, strategic growth investments.Laboratory Products and Services(Dollars in millions)20202019ChangeRevenues$12,245 $10,599 16 %Operating Income Margin10.4 %12.5 %-2.1 ptSales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $1.65 billion to $12.25 billion in 2020. Sales increased $1.41 billion (13%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $184 million due to acquisitions. The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $52 million. The increase in revenues at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for products sold through its research and safety market channel business and, to a lesser extent, service offerings of the segment's pharma services business. The increase in demand was driven by pandemic response as well as the segment’s other products and services.Operating income margin was 10.4% in 2020 and 12.5% in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to sales mix and strategic growth investments, offset in part by profit on higher sales and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements.Other Expense, NetIn 2020, the company recorded $81 million of financing costs for a terminated acquisition, primarily for amortization of loan commitment fees and entering into currency hedging contracts. In 2019, the company recorded $184 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt, offset in part by $44 million of net gains on investments. The investment gains include a $28 million gain on the sale of a joint venture for net proceeds of $42 million. In the first quarter of 2021, the company recorded approximately $197 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 10).Provision for Income TaxesThe company recorded a provision for income taxes of $850 million in 2020 (effective tax rate of 11.8%). In 2020, the company implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $96 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense and also recorded a net income tax benefit of $51 million from a domestication 30THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued)transaction involving the transfer of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the U.S.; a $47 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements; and a $27 million tax benefit from tax audit settlements.The company recorded a provision for income taxes of $374 million in 2019 (effective tax rate of 9.2%) including $191 million related to the gain on the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business. In 2019, the company recorded a $62 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements; implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $75 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense; and recorded a $79 million income tax benefit related to the deferred tax implications of intra-entity transactions which included a tax benefit to release a valuation allowance against net operating losses previously determined to be unrealizable.The effective tax rate in both 2020 and 2019 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $1.32 billion and $0.90 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The company expects its effective tax rate in 2021 will be between 11% and 13% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate.Recent Accounting PronouncementsA description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1.Contingent LiabilitiesThe company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the heading “Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters,” in Note 12 could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesConsolidated working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $11.65 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with $5.70 billion at December 31, 2019. Included in working capital were cash and cash equivalents of $10.33 billion at December 31, 2020 and $2.40 billion at December 31, 2019. The increase in cash was primarily due to the issuance of long-term senior notes in March and April 2020 and higher cash flow from operations in 2020. 2020 Cash provided by operating activities was $8.29 billion during 2020. Cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $1.30 billion and $508 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and liabilities provided cash of $1.45 billion primarily due to the timing of incentive compensation payments and, to a lesser extent, customer billings. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $1.32 billion during 2020, compared with $0.90 billion in 2019. During 2020, the company’s investing activities used $1.51 billion of cash, principally for the purchase of property, plant and equipment. In January and February 2021, the company completed acquisitions for approximately $950 million in cash plus contingent consideration and entered an agreement to acquire another business for $450 million in cash plus contingent consideration (Note 17).31THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)The company’s financing activities provided $959 million of cash during 2020. Issuance of senior notes provided cash of $3.46 billion. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $713 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company's common stock and the payment of $337 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $196 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. On November 8, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.50 billion of the company’s common stock. On November 5, 2020, the Board of Directors replaced the existing authorization to repurchase the company’s common stock, of which $1.00 billion was remaining, with a new authorization to repurchase up to $2.50 billion of the company’s common stock. Early in the first quarter of 2021, the company repurchased $1.50 billion of the company's common stock. At February 24, 2021, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company’s common stock. As of December 31, 2020, the company’s short-term debt totaled $2.63 billion, substantially all of which was redeemed in January 2021. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $3.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (Note 10). If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $31 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit. Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions and repayment of acquisition-related intercompany debt to the U.S. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $10.33 billion as of December 31, 2020 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. The company expects that for 2021, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $2.2 and $2.4 billion.In addition to the obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2020, which include debt (Note 10), unrecognized tax benefits (Note 8), operating leases (Note 11) and pension obligations (Note 7), the company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties (Note 12). 2019 Cash provided by operating activities was $4.97 billion during 2019. Cash provided by income was offset in part by increased investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $225 million and $458 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and liabilities used cash of $198 million primarily due to the timing of customer billings and tax refunds, offset in part by advanced payments from customers. Cash payments for income taxes increased to $896 million during 2019, compared with $591 million in 2018.During 2019, the company’s investing activities used $1.49 billion of cash. Acquisitions used cash of $1.84 billion. Proceeds from the sale of the Anatomical Pathology business provided $1.13 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $926 million of property, plant and equipment. The company’s financing activities used $3.12 billion of cash during 2019. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $6.36 billion. New long-term borrowings provided cash of $5.64 billion. A net decrease in commercial paper obligations used cash of $683 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company’s common stock and the payment of $297 million in cash dividends, offset in part by $153 million of net proceeds from employee stock option exercises.32THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in Swiss franc, euro, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Japanese yen and Czech koruna. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements.Interest RatesThe company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2020, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2020 was $24.67 billion (Note 14). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2020 would increase by approximately $1.52 billion. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2020 would decrease by approximately $1.92 billion.In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. In 2020, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the swap arrangements and variable-rate debt would have increased the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $14 million.Currency Exchange RatesThe company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, Canadian dollars, Swiss franc, Norwegian kroner and Danish kroner. The effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2020 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of approximately $1.22 billion.The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2020 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an additional unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $410 million. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2020 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $348 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2020 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $18 million on the company’s net income.33THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.",2023-12-30 17:37:06.689847

The company mobilized in early 2020 to support the COVID-19 pandemic response with products and services that help analyze, diagnose and protect from the virus. However, as a result of the pandemic’s impact on various markets, the company saw a significant reduction in customer activity in several businesses by late March 2020 that materially adversely affected primarily the 2020 results of the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the company’s other three segments. The negative impact significantly lessened in 2021, but could worsen in 2022 dependent on the success of global efforts to control and unwind from the pandemic and economic activity ramping up. During 2021, the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments as well as the laboratory products business continued to support COVID-19 diagnostic testing, scaling and evolving their molecular diagnostics solutions and plastic consumables businesses to respond to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. The biosciences and bioproduction businesses also expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they rapidly expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements. Additionally, through our pharma services business, we provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. While these positive impacts are expected to continue through 2022, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand. Sales of products related to COVID-19 response were $9.23 billion and $6.63 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Conditions were strong in each of the company’s end markets during 2021. Revenues were particularly strong in pharma and biotech driven by strong market dynamics and the company’s role in supporting customers across a wide range of therapeutic areas, including our role in supporting COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. Customers in the academic and 26THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSOverview (continued)government market increased demand as a result of positive funding trends around the globe and a return to pre-pandemic levels of activity. Customer activity in the industrial and applied market returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2021. Revenues from customers in the diagnostics and healthcare market were driven by growth in COVID-19 testing-related products as the company continued to support the societal response to the pandemic. Sales growth was strong across all geographic regions during 2021. The company continues to execute its proven growth strategy which consists of three pillars:•Developing high-impact, innovative new products,•Leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets, and•Delivering a unique value proposition to our customers.GAAP operating income margin and adjusted operating income margin increased in 2021 due primarily to profit on higher sales and sales mix, offset in part by strategic growth investments to support the company’s near and long-term growth. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. The company’s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system including reduced costs resulting from implementing continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing. Productivity improvements are calculated net of inflationary cost increases.Notable Recent AcquisitionsOn January 15, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, the Belgium-based European viral vector manufacturing business of Groupe Novasep SAS for $830 million in net cash consideration. The European viral vector manufacturing business provides manufacturing services for vaccines and therapies to biotechnology companies and large biopharma customers. The acquisition expands the segment’s capabilities for cell and gene vaccines and therapies. On February 25, 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Mesa Biotech, Inc., a U.S.-based molecular diagnostic company, for $407 million in net cash consideration and contingent consideration with an initial fair value of $65 million due upon the completion of certain milestones. Mesa Biotech has developed and commercialized a PCR based rapid point-of-care testing platform available for detecting infectious diseases including COVID-19. The acquisition enables the company to accelerate the availability of reliable and accurate advanced molecular diagnostics at the point of care. On September 30, 2021, the company assumed operating responsibility, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, of a new state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility in Lengnau, Switzerland from CSL Limited to perform pharma services for CSL with capacity to serve other customers as well. The company expects to make fixed lease payments aggregating to $555 million (excluding renewals) from 2021 to 2041, with additional amounts dependent on the extent of revenues from customers of the facility other than CSL. On December 8, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, PPD, Inc., a U.S.-based global provider of clinical research services to the pharma and biotech industry, for $15.99 billion in net cash consideration and $43 million of equity awards exchanged. The addition of PPD’s clinical research services enhances our offering to biotech and pharma customers by enabling them to accelerate innovation and increase their productivity within the drug development process. In 2020, PPD generated revenues of $4.68 billion.On December 30, 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, PeproTech, Inc., a U.S. based developer and manufacturer of recombinant proteins, for $1.86 billion in net cash consideration. PeproTech provides bioscience reagents known as recombinant proteins, including cytokines and growth factors. The acquisition expands the segment’s bioscience offerings.Results of OperationsThe company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits as defined in Note 4.

See additional discussion under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. GAAP other income/(expense) and adjusted other income/(expense) includes currency transaction gains and losses on non-operating monetary assets and liabilities and net periodic pension benefit cost/income, excluding the service cost component. GAAP other income/(expense) in 2021 also includes $767 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt (Note 10) and $36 million of financing costs associated with obtaining bridge financing commitments in connection with the agreement to acquire PPD (Note 2), offset in part by $66 million of net gains on investments. GAAP other income/(expense) in 2020 includes $81 million of financing costs for a terminated acquisition, primarily for loan commitment fees and entering into hedging contracts and $42 million of expense reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive items related to a hedge arrangement (Note 14), offset in part by $10 million of net gains on investments. The company’s GAAP and adjusted tax rates increased in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher profits at different marginal rates, offset in part by the benefits of our tax planning initiatives. The company’s 2021 GAAP and adjusted tax rates were also impacted by income tax benefits on intra-entity transactions totaling $284 million. In 2020, the company’s GAAP and adjusted tax rates were impacted by foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $96 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense; a net income tax benefit of $51 million from a domestication transaction involving the transfer of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the U.S.; and a $47 million income tax benefit related to a foreign exchange loss for tax purposes on certain intercompany financing arrangements. Additionally, the 2020 GAAP tax rate included a $27 million tax benefit from tax audit settlements. The effective tax rate in both 2021 and 2020 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $2.18 billion and $1.32 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The company expects its GAAP effective tax rate in 2022 will be between 9% and 11% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. The company expects its adjusted tax rate will be approximately 13% in 2022.29THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSResults of Operations (continued) The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe company’s proven growth strategy has enabled it to generate free cash flow as well as access the capital markets. The company deploys its capital primarily via mergers and acquisitions and secondarily via share buybacks and dividends.December 31,December 31,(In millions)20212020Cash and cash equivalents$4,477 $10,325 Total debt34,870 21,735 Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions, capacity expansion, and repayment of third-party foreign debt by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. As of December 31, 2021, the company’s short-term debt totaled $2.54 billion. On January 7, 2022, the company replaced its prior credit facility with a new revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (Note 10). If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2021, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $4 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.

Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $204 million and $1.07 billion, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. An increase in accounts payable provided cash of $479 million. Changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $724 million primarily due to the timing of tax and incentive compensation payments. Cash payments for income taxes were $2.18 billion during 2021.During 2020, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $1.30 billion and $508 million, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. Changes in other assets and other liabilities provided cash of $1.45 billion primarily due to the timing of incentive compensation payments and, to a lesser extent, customer billings. Cash payments for income taxes were $1.32 billion during 2020.During 2021, acquisitions used cash of $19.40 billion. The company's investing activities also included the purchase of $2.52 billion of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments. During 2020, the company’s investing activities were principally for the purchase of property, plant and equipment. 30THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital Resources (continued)During 2021, issuance of senior notes provided $18.14 billion of cash. A net increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $2.51 billion. Repayment of debt used cash of $11.74 billion, including $4.30 billion to repay the debt assumed in the acquisition of PPD. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (4.1 million shares) and the payment of $395 million in cash dividends. On September 23, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.00 billion of the company’s common stock. Early in the first quarter of 2022, the company repurchased $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (3.3 million shares). At February 24, 2022, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company’s common stock. As discussed in Note 10, in the first quarter of 2022 the company redeemed its 3.650% Senior Notes due 2025 for a total cash outlay of $375 million.During 2020, issuance of senior notes provided cash of $3.46 billion. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $710 million. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company’s common stock (4.5 million shares) and the payment of $337 million in cash dividends.The company expects that for all of 2022, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $2.5 and $2.7 billion.In addition to the obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2021, which include, but are not limited to, debt (Note 10), unrecognized tax benefits (Note 8), operating leases (Note 11) pension obligations (Note 7) and contingent consideration (Note 14), the company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties (Note 12). The company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the heading “Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters,” in Note 12 could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.Non-GAAP MeasuresIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company’s short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation on revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods.We report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company’s core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable:•Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs.•Costs/income associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs.•Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. •The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years. Exclusion of 31THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSNon-GAAP Measures (continued)the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies.•The tax impacts of the above items and the impact of significant tax audits or events (such as changes in deferred taxes from enacted tax rate changes), the latter of which we exclude because they are outside of our normal operations and difficult to forecast accurately for future periods.We report free cash flow, which is operating cash flow, excluding net capital expenditures to provide a view of the continuing operations’ ability to generate cash for use in acquisitions and other investing and financing activities. The company uses this measure as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash for use in acquisitions and other investing and financing activities. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.The non-GAAP financial measures of Thermo Fisher Scientific’s results of operations and cash flows included in this Form 10-K are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for Thermo Fisher Scientific’s results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to acquisition-related measurements and income taxes. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:Acquisition-related Measurements Business CombinationsThe company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses, which include estimates of customer attrition and technology obsolesce rates. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. See Note 2 for additional information about our recent business combinations.33THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible AssetsThe company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $41.92 billion and $1.24 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2021 (see Note 1 for additional information). Estimates of discounted future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth rates, discount rates and other factors. For the goodwill impairment tests, the company considers (i) peer revenues and earnings trading multiples from companies that have operational and financial characteristics that are similar to the respective reporting units and (ii) estimated weighted average costs of capital. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.The company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for all of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Indications of fair value based on projections of cash flows, which increased over the prior year projections at higher rates than the increases in carrying values, and on peer revenues, earnings trading multiples and discount rates, which were relatively consistent with the prior year, were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2021, the date of the company’s annual impairment testing. There were no interim impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2021. There can be no assurance, however, that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company’s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired. Should the fair value of the company’s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary.Definite-lived Intangible AssetsDefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $18.88 billion at December 31, 2021 (see Note 1 for additional information). The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. The company recorded impairments of $0.12 billion in 2021 (see Note 16 for additional information).Contingent ConsiderationThe fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, which were initially exchanged for control of businesses or assumed from acquired businesses, was $0.32 billion at December 31, 2021. At each reporting period, the fair value of contingent consideration is determined using either discounted cash flow analyses, Monte Carlo simulations, or fair values of an underlying recapitalization investment portfolio. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes in estimates of revenue or operating results or in the timing or likelihood of achieving milestones, as well as changes in the fair values of the investments underlying the recapitalization investment portfolio. These changes resulted in (benefits)/charges of $(0.05) billion during 2021 (see Note 14 for additional information). Income TaxesUnrecognized Tax BenefitsIn the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. The company’s liability for these unrecognized tax benefits totaled $1.12 billion at December 31, 2021 (see Note 8 for additional information).34THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates (continued)The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the company to interpret the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income.Valuation AllowancesThe company estimates the degree to which tax assets will result in a benefit, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets that it believes will more likely than not go unused. In situations in which the company has been able to determine that its deferred tax assets will be realized, that determination generally relies on future reversals of taxable temporary differences and expected future taxable income. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $0.97 billion at December 31, 2021 (see Note 8 for additional information). Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary.Undistributed EarningsThe company has not provided U.S. state income taxes or additional non-U.S. taxes on certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings, as such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the United States indefinitely in the respective jurisdictions based on specific business plans and tax strategies (see Note 8 for additional information). These business plans and tax strategies consider: short-term and long-term forecasts and budgets of the U.S. parent and non-U.S. subsidiaries; working capital and other needs in locations where earnings are generated; the company’s past practices regarding non-U.S. subsidiary dividends; sources of financing by the U.S. parent, such as issuing debt or equity; and uses of cash by the U.S. parent that are more discretionary in nature, such as business combinations and share repurchase programs. However, should the company change its business plans and tax strategies in the future and decide to repatriate a portion of these earnings to one of its U.S. subsidiaries, including cash maintained by these non-U.S. subsidiaries, the company would recognize additional tax liabilities. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional U.S. state income tax and non-U.S. tax liabilities that the company would incur. The company’s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax costs. Recent Accounting PronouncementsA description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, Swiss franc, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Czech koruna, Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollars. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements.Interest RatesThe company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2021, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s 35THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (continued)fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2021 was $36.05 billion (Note 14). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2021 would increase by approximately $2.51 billion. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2021 would decrease by approximately $2.52 billion.In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. In 2021, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the swap arrangements and variable-rate debt would have increased the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $6 million.Currency Exchange RatesThe company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, Canadian dollars, Norwegian kroner and Danish kroner. The effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2021 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of approximately $1.23 billion.The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2021 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an additional unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $71 million. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2021 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $71 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates.

Since 2020, the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments as well as the laboratory products business have supported COVID-19 diagnostic testing, scaling and evolving their molecular diagnostics solutions and plastic consumables businesses to respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The biosciences and bioproduction businesses have expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they have expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements. Additionally, our pharma services business has provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. While these positive impacts are expected to continue through 2023, the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing as well as therapy and vaccine demand. Sales of products related to COVID-19 testing were $3.11 billion and $7.26 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. During 2022 demand from pharma and biotech customers was very strong, driven by our differentiated customer value proposition and trusted partner status. We saw good growth in the academic and government market as we remain well positioned to meet customer needs. The industrial and applied market was strong, driven by robust demand for our analytical instruments serving our semi-conductor and materials science customers. The diagnostics and healthcare market declined due to decreased demand for COVID-19 testing products. During 2022, robust sales growth in North America and the Asia Pacific region, including China, was partially offset by a decline in COVID-19 testing demand. In Europe, strong sales were more than offset during 2022 due to lower COVID-19 testing demand. Contributions to organic revenue during 2022 were driven by the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services and Analytical Instruments segments, as offset by the Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segments.The company continues to execute its proven growth strategy which consists of three pillars:•Developing high-impact, innovative new products,•Leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets, and•Delivering a unique value proposition to our customers.GAAP operating income margin and adjusted operating income margin decreased in 2022 due primarily to lower COVID-19 testing volumes, continued strategic growth investments, and the expected impact of incorporating recent acquisitions. This was partially offset by strong pricing realization across all segments to address higher inflation while also driving strong productivity. GAAP operating income margin in 2022 was also impacted by higher amortization expense as a result of 2021 acquisitions. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience, as well as incentive compensation and recognition for employees. The company’s references throughout this discussion to 19THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system including reduced costs resulting from implementing continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing.Notable Recent AcquisitionsOn January 15, 2021, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, the Belgium-based European viral vector manufacturing business of Groupe Novasep SAS. The European viral vector manufacturing business provides manufacturing services for vaccines and therapies to biotechnology companies and large biopharma customers. The acquisition expands the segment’s capabilities for cell and gene vaccines and therapies. On February 25, 2021, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Mesa Biotech, Inc., a U.S.-based molecular diagnostic company. Mesa Biotech has developed and commercialized a PCR based rapid point-of-care testing platform available for detecting infectious diseases including COVID-19. The acquisition enables the company to accelerate the availability of reliable and accurate advanced molecular diagnostics at the point of care.

The decrease in segment income margin was primarily due to lower COVID-19 testing volume, largely offset by productivity improvements and positive business mix. Segment income margin in 2021 was also impacted by a $13 million credit to cost of product revenue as a result of changing the method of accounting for inventories.Laboratory Products and Biopharma ServicesOrganic* (non-GAAP measure)(Dollars in millions)20222021TotalChangeCurrencyTranslationAcquisitions/ DivestituresRevenues$22,511 $14,862 51 %(3)%45 %10 %Segment income2,872 1,844 56 %Segment income margin12.8 %12.4 %0.4 ptThe increase in organic revenues in 2022 was primarily due to higher sales across each of the segment’s businesses, with particular strength in the pharma services business and research and safety market channel. PPD, the company’s clinical research business, contributed $7.11 billion of revenue during 2022. The increase in segment income margin was primarily due to the benefit of recent acquisitions, profit on higher sales, and productivity improvements, offset in part by strategic growth investments. Segment income margin in 2021 was also impacted by a $20 million credit to cost of product revenue as a result of changing the method of accounting for inventories.* Results may not sum due to roundingNon-operating Items(Dollars in millions)20222021Net interest expense$454 $493 GAAP other income/(expense)(104)(694)Adjusted other income/(expense) (non-GAAP measure)13 38 GAAP tax rate9.0 %12.5 %Adjusted tax rate (non-GAAP measure)13.0 %14.6 %Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) decreased due primarily to lower average interest rates on debt and higher average interest rates on cash balances, partially offset by the increase in debt to finance the acquisition of PPD and for general corporate purposes. See additional discussion under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. GAAP other income/(expense) and adjusted other income/(expense) includes currency transaction gains, losses on non-operating monetary assets and liabilities, and net periodic pension benefit cost/income, excluding the service cost component. GAAP other income/(expense) in 2022 also includes $160 million of net losses on investments, $26 million of losses on the 21THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.early extinguishment of debt (Note 10), partially offset by $67 million of net gains on derivative instruments to address certain foreign currency risks and $2 million of net settlement gains on pension plans. GAAP other income/(expense) in 2021 also includes $767 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt and $36 million of financing costs associated with obtaining bridge financing commitments in connection with the agreement to acquire PPD (Note 2), offset in part by $66 million of net gains on investments. The company’s GAAP and adjusted tax rates decreased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to releases of valuation allowances of $87 million in 2022 in jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are now expected to be realized. The company’s 2022 GAAP tax rate was also impacted by changes in tax rates and higher amortization expense as a result of 2021 acquisitions, as well as a net benefit of $208 million resulting from tax audit settlements (see Note 8). The company’s 2021 GAAP and adjusted tax rates were also impacted by income tax benefits on intra-entity transactions totaling $284 million.The effective tax rate in both 2022 and 2021 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company’s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $1.23 billion and $2.18 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The company expects its GAAP effective tax rate in 2023 will be between 7% and 9% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events. The company expects its adjusted tax rate will be approximately 11% in 2023. The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 70 countries outside the U.S. Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S. The company’s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries. Based on the dispersion of the company’s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company’s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company’s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe company’s proven growth strategy has enabled it to generate free cash flow as well as access the capital markets. The company deploys its capital primarily via mergers and acquisitions and secondarily via share buybacks and dividends.December 31,December 31,(In millions)20222021Cash and cash equivalents$8,524 $4,477 Total debt34,488 34,870 Approximately half of the company’s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S. The company uses its non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including acquisitions, capacity expansion, and repayment of third-party foreign debt by foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the company also transfers cash to the U.S. using non-taxable returns of capital as well as dividends where the related U.S. dividend received deduction or foreign tax credit equals any tax cost arising from the dividends. As a result of using such means of transferring cash to the U.S., the company does not expect any material adverse liquidity effects from its significant non-U.S. cash balances for the foreseeable future. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months. As of December 31, 2022, the company’s short-term debt totaled $5.58 billion. The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $5.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit (Note 10). If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available. As of December 31, 2022, no borrowings were outstanding under the company’s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by immaterial outstanding letters of credit.22THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.(In millions)20222021Net cash provided by operating activities$9,154 $9,312 Net cash used in investing activities(2,159)(21,932)Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities(2,810)6,581 Free cash flow (non-GAAP measure)6,935 6,809 Operating ActivitiesDuring 2022, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $0.43 billion and $0.83 billion, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. An increase in accounts payable provided cash of $0.65 billion. Cash payments for income taxes were $1.23 billion during 2022. During 2021, cash provided by income was offset in part by investments in working capital. Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $0.20 billion and $1.07 billion, respectively, primarily to support growth in sales. An increase in accounts payable provided cash of $0.48 billion. Changes in other assets and other liabilities used cash of $0.72 billion primarily due to the timing of tax and incentive compensation payments. Cash payments for income taxes were $2.18 billion during 2021. The company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the heading “Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters,” in Note 12 could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.Investing ActivitiesDuring 2022, acquisitions used cash of $0.04 billion. The company’s investing activities were principally for the purchase of property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments.During 2021, acquisitions used cash of $19.40 billion. The company’s investing activities also included the purchase of $2.52 billion of property, plant and equipment. The company expects that for all of 2023, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be approximately $2.0 billion.Financing ActivitiesDuring 2022, issuance of senior notes provided $3.19 billion in cash. Repayment of senior notes and net commercial paper activity used cash of $0.38 billion and $2.16 billion, respectively. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $3.00 billion of the company’s common stock (5.3 million shares) and the payment of $0.46 billion in cash dividends. On September 23, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.00 billion of the company’s common stock. All of the shares of common stock repurchased by the company during the fourth quarter of 2022 were purchased under this program, depleting the 2021 authorization. On November 10, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $4.00 billion of the company’s common stock. Early in the first quarter of 2023, the company repurchased $3.00 billion of the company's common stock (5.2 million shares). At February 23, 2023, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company’s common stock. During 2021, issuance of senior notes provided $18.14 billion of cash. A net increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $2.51 billion. Repayment of debt used cash of $11.74 billion, including $4.30 billion to repay the debt assumed in the acquisition of PPD. The company’s financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (4.1 million shares) and the payment of $0.40 billion in cash dividends.In addition to the obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2022, which include, but are not limited to, debt (Note 10), unrecognized tax benefits (Note 8), operating leases (Note 11), pension obligations (Note 7) and contingent consideration (Note 14), the company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties (Note 12). Non-GAAP MeasuresIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company’s short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions/divestitures and foreign currency translation on 23THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods.We report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company’s core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable:•Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs.•Costs/income associated with restructuring activities and large-scale abandonments of product lines, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities and large-scale abandonment of product lines are not indicative of our normal operating costs.•Equity in earnings/losses of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods. •The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years. Exclusion of the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both our newly acquired and long-held businesses and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies.•The tax impacts of the above items and the impact of significant tax audits or events (such as changes in deferred taxes from enacted tax rate/law changes), the latter of which we exclude because they are outside of our normal operations and difficult to forecast accurately for future periods.We report free cash flow, which is operating cash flow excluding net capital expenditures, to provide a view of the continuing operations’ ability to generate cash for use in acquisitions and other investing and financing activities. The company also uses this measure as an indication of the strength of the company. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.The non-GAAP financial measures of the company’s results of operations and cash flows included in this Form 10-K are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for the company’s results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted results in 2022 also exclude a $423 million charge for the impact of deferred tax realizability assessments as a result of audit settlements.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to acquisition-related measurements and income taxes. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 25THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:Acquisition-related Measurements Business CombinationsThe company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company’s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses, which include estimates of customer attrition and technology obsolescence rates. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. See Note 2 for additional information about our recent business combinations.Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible AssetsThe company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an asset below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts, among others. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $41.20 billion and $1.24 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2022 (see Note 1 for additional information). Estimates of discounted future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth rates, discount rates and other factors. For the goodwill impairment tests, the company also considers (i) peer revenues and earnings trading multiples from companies that have operational and financial characteristics that are similar to the respective reporting units and (ii) estimated weighted average costs of capital. Different assumptions from those made in the company’s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.Except as described below, the company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for all of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Determinations of fair value based on projections of discounted cash flows, which decreased from the prior year projections primarily due to higher discount rates, and based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples, which also decreased from the prior year, were sufficient to conclude that no impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2022, the date of the company’s annual impairment testing. There were no interim impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2022. There can be no assurance, however, that adverse events or conditions will not cause the fair values of these assets to decline. Should the fair values of the company’s reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rates, charges for impairment may be necessary.With the completion of the PPD acquisition in December 2021, the company established two new reporting units that solely consist of the legacy PPD businesses, the book carrying values of which equaled their fair values as of the acquisition date. During its annual 2022 goodwill impairment assessments, the company performed qualitative assessments of these reporting units and determined that no events had occurred and no circumstances had changed that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair values of the reporting units below their carrying amounts. As a result, the company did not perform the quantitative goodwill impairment tests for these reporting units. Given that the fair values of the reporting units were unlikely to be substantially in excess of their carrying values as of the annual 2022 assessment date, relatively small decreases in future cash flows versus anticipated results, decreases in peer trading multiples and/or increases in weighted average costs of capital could result in impairment of goodwill. The reporting units consisting of the legacy PPD businesses had $13.41 billion of goodwill, and an overall carrying value of $19.30 billion as of December 31, 2022.Definite-lived Intangible AssetsDefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $16.21 billion at December 31, 2022 (see Note 1 for additional information). Certain definite-lived intangible assets have largely independent cash flows. The company reviews these definite-lived intangible assets for impairment individually when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows, which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset. Most of the company’s definite-lived intangible assets are used in conjunction with other assets, such as property, plant and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets. In these situations, the company considers 26THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.the asset groups to be the units of account for impairment testing. The company recorded impairments of $0.12 billion in 2021 (see Note 16).Income TaxesUnrecognized Tax BenefitsIn the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company’s income tax positions. The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes. The company’s liability for these unrecognized tax benefits totaled $0.57 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to $1.12 billion at December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of an audit settlement (see Note 8).The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments. Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the company to interpret the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company’s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company’s net income.Valuation AllowancesThe company estimates the degree to which tax assets will result in a benefit, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets that it believes will more likely than not go unused. In situations in which the company has been able to determine that its deferred tax assets will be realized, that determination generally relies on future reversals of taxable temporary differences and expected future taxable income. If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance. Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company’s tax provision. The company’s tax valuation allowance totaled $1.32 billion at December 31, 2022, compared to $0.97 billion at December 31, 2021, primarily driven by the assessment of additional tax assets resulting from an audit settlement during the year (see Note 8). Should the company’s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary.Recent Accounting PronouncementsA description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition. The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities. The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps. Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Singapore dollars, Japanese yen, Hong Kong dollars, Czech koruna and Swedish krona. Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged. The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements.Interest RatesThe company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company’s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2022, the company’s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings. The fair market value of the company’s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as 27THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The total estimated fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2022 was $30.29 billion (Note 14). Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity. If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2022 would increase by approximately $2.00 billion. If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company’s debt at December 31, 2022 would decrease by approximately $1.75 billion.In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company’s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including swap arrangements. In 2022, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the swap arrangements and variable-rate debt would have increased the company’s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $35 million.Currency Exchange RatesThe company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent. The company’s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The functional currencies of the company’s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Swedish krona, Canadian dollars, Norwegian kroner and Danish kroner. The effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the “accumulated other comprehensive items” component of shareholders’ equity. The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2022 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of approximately $1.45 billion.The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in year-end 2022 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an additional unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $9 million. A 10% appreciation in year-end 2022 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company’s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $9 million. The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.Certain of the company’s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates. A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2022 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $21 million on the company’s net income.",2023-12-30 17:37:08.057867
