200406,JNJ,JOHNSON & JOHNSON,2016,"Item 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONOrganization and Business SegmentsDescription of the Company and Business SegmentsJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 127,100 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, skin care, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on five therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, cardiovascular, diabetes care and vision care fields which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments.In all of its product lines, the Company competes with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.Management’s Objectives The Company manages within a strategic framework with Our Credo as the foundation. The Company believes that our strategic operating principles: being broadly based in human health care, managing the business for the long term, having a decentralized management approach, and being committed to our people and values, are crucial to successfully meeting the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which we compete. To this end, management is focused on our long-term strategic growth drivers: creating value through innovation, expanding our global reach with a local focus, excellence in execution and leading with purpose. The Company is broadly based in human health care, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2015 sales. In 2015, $9.0 billion, or 12.9% of sales, was invested in research and development, reflecting management’s commitment to delivering new and differentiated products and services to meet evolving health care needs and sustain the Company’s long-term growth. Our diverse businesses with more than 250 operating companies located in 60 countries are the key drivers of the Company’s success. Maintaining the Company’s decentralized management approach, while at the same time leveraging the extensive resources of the enterprise, positions the Company well to innovate, execute strategic plans and reach markets globally, as well as address the needs and challenges of the local markets. In order to remain a leader in health care, the Company strives to maintain a purpose-driven organization and is committed to developing global business leaders who can achieve these growth objectives. Businesses are managed for the long-term in order to sustain market leadership positions and enable growth, which provides an enduring source of value to our shareholders.Our Credo unifies all Johnson & Johnson employees in achieving these objectives, and provides a common set of values that serve as the foundation of the Company’s responsibilities to patients, consumers and health care professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. The Company believes that these foundational values, its strategic framework and long-term growth drivers, along with its overall mission of improving the quality of life for people around the world, will enable Johnson & Johnson to continue to be a leader in the health care industry. 9 Results of OperationsAnalysis of Consolidated SalesIn 2015, worldwide sales decreased 5.7% to $70.1 billion, compared to increases of 4.2% in 2014 and 6.1% in 2013. These sales changes consisted of the following:Sales increase/(decrease) due to: 2015 2014 2013Volume 1.2 % 6.3 7.6Price 0.6 (0.2) 0.1Currency (7.5) (1.9) (1.6)Total (5.7)% 4.2 6.1In 2015, the introduction of competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), had a negative impact of 2.7% on the worldwide operational sales growth. In 2015, the impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide operational sales growth was negative 2.0%. In 2014, sales of the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), had a positive impact of 2.8%, and the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business had a negative impact of 1.4% on the worldwide operational growth. In 2013, the acquisition of Synthes, Inc., net of the related divestiture, increased worldwide operational growth by 2.5%.Sales by U.S. companies were $35.7 billion in 2015, $34.8 billion in 2014 and $31.9 billion in 2013. This represents increases of 2.6% in 2015, 9.0% in 2014 and 7.0% in 2013. Sales by international companies were $34.4 billion in 2015, $39.5 billion in 2014 and $39.4 billion in 2013. This represents a decrease of 13.1% in 2015, and increases of 0.4% in 2014 and 5.4% in 2013.The five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 2.6%, 3.9% and 1.4%, respectively. The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.3%, 2.3% and 4.5%, respectively.Sales by companies in Europe experienced a decline of 15.6% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 1.1%, offset by a negative currency impact of 16.7%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) experienced a decline of 15.6% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 2.6% offset by a negative currency impact of 18.2%. Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region experienced a decline of 8.1% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 0.3% and a negative currency impact of 8.4%.2015 results benefited from the inclusion of a 53rd week. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Annual Closing Date details). The Company estimated that the fiscal year 2015 growth rate was enhanced by approximately 1.0%. While the additional week added a few days to sales, it also added a full week's worth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible.In 2015 and 2014, the Company had one wholesaler distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 12.5% and 11.0%, respectively, of the total consolidated revenues. In 2013, the Company did not have a customer that represented 10% or more of total consolidated revenues.U.S. Health Care ReformOn July 28, 2014, the Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations for the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, an annual non-tax deductible fee imposed on entities engaged in the business of manufacturing or importing branded prescription drugs (covered entities), enacted by Section 9008 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The final regulations accelerated the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation by one year, from the year in which the fee is paid to the year in which the sales used to calculate the fee occur. This change impacted covered entities and resulted in the need for all entities to record an additional expense in 2014 for the fee that would have otherwise been expensed when paid in 2015. The Company accrued an additional $220 million in the fiscal third quarter of 2014 due to this change. The fee associated with this accelerated expense was paid, as scheduled, in 2015 and had no cash impact in 2014. 10 Analysis of Sales by Business SegmentsConsumer SegmentConsumer segment sales in 2015 were $13.5 billion, a decrease of 6.8% from 2014, which included 2.7% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 9.5%. U.S. Consumer segment sales were $5.2 billion, an increase of 2.5%. International sales were $8.3 billion, a decrease of 11.9%, which included 2.7% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 14.6%. In 2015, divestitures had a negative impact of 1.4% on the worldwide Consumer segment operational growth.Major Consumer Franchise Sales: % Change(Dollars in Millions) 2015 2014 2013 ’15 vs. ’14 ’14 vs. ’13OTC $3,975 4,106 4,028 (3.2)% 1.9Skin Care 3,531 3,758 3,704 (6.0) 1.5Baby Care 2,044 2,239 2,295 (8.7) (2.4)Oral Care 1,580 1,647 1,622 (4.1) 1.5Women’s Health 1,200 1,302 1,568 (7.8) (17.0)Wound Care/Other 1,177 1,444 1,480 (18.5) (2.4)Total Consumer Sales $13,507 14,496 14,697 (6.8)% (1.4)The Over-the-Counter (OTC) franchise sales of $4.0 billion decreased 3.2% as compared to the prior year, which included 8.1% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 11.3%. Operational growth was primarily driven by analgesics, upper respiratory, including ZYRTEC®, and digestive health products. McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (McNEIL-PPC) continues to operate under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which governs certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations and requires McNEIL-PPC to remediate the facilities it operates in Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Fort Washington, Pennsylvania; and Las Piedras, Puerto Rico (the Consent Decree). In February 2015, a third-party expert submitted written certification to the FDA for all three manufacturing sites. Following FDA inspections in 2015, McNEIL-PPC received notifications from the FDA that all three manufacturing facilities are in conformity with applicable laws and regulations. Under the Consent Decree, after receiving notice from the FDA of being in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, each of the three facilities is subject to a five-year audit period by a third-party cGMP expert. Thus, a third-party expert will continue to reassess the sites at various times for at least five years. The Skin Care franchise sales of $3.5 billion decreased 6.0% as compared to the prior year, which included 1.3% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 7.3%. Operational growth was primarily due to sales growth of NEUTROGENA® and AVEENO® products partially offset by lower sales in China. The Baby Care franchise sales were $2.0 billion in 2015, a decrease of 8.7% compared to the prior year, which included 1.2% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 9.9%. Operational growth was primarily due to new product launches partially offset by competition in China.The Oral Care franchise sales were $1.6 billion in 2015, a decrease of 4.1% as compared to the prior year, which included 5.2% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 9.3%. Operational growth was driven by increased sales of LISTERINE® products, attributable to geographical expansion of new products and successful marketing campaigns. The Women’s Health franchise sales were $1.2 billion in 2015, a decrease of 7.8% as compared to the prior year, which included 7.6% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 15.4%. Operational growth outside the U.S. was driven by new product launches and successful marketing campaigns. The Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $1.2 billion in 2015, a decrease of 18.5% from 2014, primarily due to the SPLENDA® and BENECOL® divestitures. Consumer segment sales in 2014 were $14.5 billion, a decrease of 1.4% from 2013, which included 1.0% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 2.4%. U.S. Consumer segment sales were $5.1 billion, a decrease of 1.3%. International sales were $9.4 billion, a decrease of 1.4%, which included 2.3% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 3.7%. 11 Pharmaceutical SegmentPharmaceutical segment sales in 2015 were $31.4 billion, a decrease of 2.7% from 2014, which included operational growth of 4.2% offset by a negative currency impact of 6.9%. U.S. sales were $18.3 billion, an increase of 5.2%. International sales were $13.1 billion, a decrease of 12.0%, which included 3.0% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 15.0%. The Pharmaceutical segment operational growth was negatively impacted by 6.5% due to the introduction of competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), and positively impacted by 1.4% due to an adjustment to previous reserve estimates, including Managed Medicaid rebates primarily in the Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other therapeutic area. In 2015, divestitures had a negative impact of 0.3% on the worldwide Pharmaceutical segment operational growth.Major Pharmaceutical Therapeutic Area Sales:* % Change(Dollars in Millions) 2015 2014 2013 ’15 vs. ’14 ’14 vs. ’13Total Immunology $10,402 10,193 9,190 2.1 % 10.9 REMICADE® 6,561 6,868 6,673 (4.5) 2.9 SIMPONI®/SIMPONI ARIA® 1,328 1,187 932 11.9 27.4 STELARA® 2,474 2,072 1,504 19.4 37.8 Other Immunology 39 66 81 (40.9) (18.5)Total Infectious Diseases 3,656 5,599 3,550 (34.7) 57.7 EDURANT® 410 365 236 12.3 54.7 OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® 621 2,302 23 (73.0) ** PREZISTA®/ PREZCOBIX®/REZOLSTA® 1,810 1,831 1,673 (1.1) 9.4 Other Infectious Diseases 815 1,101 1,618 (26.0) (32.0)Total Neuroscience 6,259 6,487 6,667 (3.5) (2.7) CONCERTA®/methylphenidate 821 599 782 37.1 (23.4) INVEGA®/paliperidone 573 640 583 (10.5) 9.8 INVEGA SUSTENNA®/XEPLION®/INVEGA TRINZA® 1,830 1,588 1,248 15.2 27.2 RISPERDAL® CONSTA® 970 1,190 1,318 (18.5) (9.7) Other Neuroscience 2,065 2,470 2,736 (16.4) (9.7)Total Oncology 4,695 4,457 3,773 5.3 18.1 IMBRUVICA® 689 200 — ** — VELCADE® 1,333 1,618 1,660 (17.6) (2.5) ZYTIGA® 2,231 2,237 1,698 (0.3) 31.7 Other Oncology 442 402 415 10.0 (3.1)Cardiovascular / Metabolism / Other*** 6,418 5,577 4,945 15.1 12.8 XARELTO® 1,868 1,522 864 22.7 76.2 INVOKANA®/ INVOKAMET® 1,308 586 123 ** ** PROCRIT®/EPREX® 1,068 1,238 1,364 (13.7) (9.2) Other 2,174 2,231 2,594 (2.6) (14.0)Total Pharmaceutical Sales $31,430 32,313 28,125 (2.7)% 14.9* Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.** Percentage greater than 100%***Previously referred to as OtherImmunology products achieved sales of $10.4 billion in 2015, representing an increase of 2.1% as compared to the prior year. Immunology products growth of 2.1% included operational growth of 6.9% and a negative currency impact of 4.8%. The increased sales of STELARA® (ustekinumab) and SIMPONI®/SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab) were due to market growth and increased penetration of SIMPONI ARIA®. Growth was partially offset by lower REMICADE® (infliximab) sales to the Company's distributor primarily due to the weakening of the euro and biosimilar competition in Europe. The patents for REMICADE® in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE® have been introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE® in those markets. 12 Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE® sales in markets outside the United States. The timing of the possible introduction of a biosimilar version of REMICADE® in the United States is subject to enforcement of patent rights, approval by the FDA and compliance with the 180-day notice provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (the BPCIA). On February 9, 2016, the Arthritis Advisory Committee of the FDA recommended by a vote of 21-3 to approve the first investigational biosimilar infliximab across all eligible indications in the United States. There is a risk that a competitor could launch a biosimilar version of REMICADE® following FDA approval (subject to compliance with the 180-day notice provisions of the BPCIA), even though one or more valid patents are in place. Introduction to the U.S. market of a biosimilar version of REMICADE® will result in a reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE®. In 2015, U.S. sales of REMICADE® were $4.5 billion. The launch of a biosimilar version of REMICADE® in the U.S. is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows in 2016. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for legal matters regarding the REMICADE® patents.Infectious disease products sales were $3.7 billion, a decline of 34.7% from 2014, which included an operational decrease of 27.6% and a negative currency impact of 7.1%. Competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), had a significant negative impact on U.S. sales and will continue to have a negative impact on future sales. The decline of Hepatitis C sales was partially offset by sales growth of EDURANT®(rilpivirine) and sales of PREZISTA®/ PREZCOBIX®/REZOLSTA® (darunavir/cobicistat). Neuroscience products sales were $6.3 billion, a decrease of 3.5% from 2014, which included an operational growth of 5.0% and a negative currency impact of 8.5%. The U.S. sales growth of CONCERTA®/methylphenidate was primarily due to a therapeutic equivalence reclassification of generic competitors by the FDA in November 2014. Strong sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA®/XEPLION®/INVEGA TRINZA® (paliperidone palmitate) were primarily due to increased market share and the launch of INVEGA TRINZA®. Neuroscience products sales were negatively impacted by the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA® (tapentadol) and lower sales of RISPERDAL® CONSTA® (risperidone).Oncology products achieved sales of $4.7 billion in 2015, representing an increase of 5.3% as compared to the prior year. Oncology products growth of 5.3% included operational growth of 17.7% and a negative currency impact of 12.4%. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) due to the approval of new indications, additional country launches and strong patient uptake. Additionally, sales of ZYTIGA® (abiraterone acetate) grew in the U.S. due to market growth partially offset by share decline, and strong growth in Asia and Latin America was partially offset by lower sales in Europe due to competition. Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products achieved sales of $6.4 billion in 2015, representing an increase of 15.1% as compared to the prior year due to strong sales of XARELTO®(rivaroxaban) and INVOKANA®/INVOKAMET® (canagliflozin). PROCRIT®/EPREX® (Epoetin alfa) sales were impacted by competition. 13 During 2015, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows:Product Name (Chemical Name)IndicationUS ApprovEU ApprovUS FilingEU FilingDARZALEX™ (daratumumab)For the treatment of double refractory multiple myelomaü üEDURANT® (rilpiravine)For use in combination with other anti-retroviral agents, for the treatment-naïve adolescent patients aged 12 to 18 years with HIV-1 infectionüü IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib)Treatment of Waldenström's Macroglobulinemiaüü Treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma in combination with bendamustine and rituximab üü For use in treatment-naïve patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia üüINVEGA TRINZA® (paliperidone palmitate)An atypical antipsychotic injection administered four times a year for the treatment of schizophreniaü üINVOKAMET® XR (canagliflozin)A once-daily therapy combining fixed doses of canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride extended release for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes ü PREZCOBIX® (darunavir/cobicistat)For use in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1)ü SIMPONI® (golimumab)Treatment of non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis ü STELARA® (ustekinumab)For the treatment of adolescents with moderate-to-severe psoriasis ü For the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease üüVELCADE ® (bortezomib)For use in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma ü YONDELIS® (trabectedin)For the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic liposarcoma or leiomyosarcomaü The Pharmaceutical segment achieved sales of $32.3 billion in 2014, representing an increase of 14.9% over the prior year, with strong operational growth of 16.5% and a negative currency impact of 1.6%. U.S. sales were $17.4 billion, an increase of 25.0%. International sales were $14.9 billion, an increase of 5.0%, which included 8.3% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 3.3%. In 2013, Pharmaceutical segment sales included a positive adjustment to previous estimates for Managed Medicaid rebates. This negatively impacted 2014 Pharmaceutical operational sales growth by 0.8% as compared to the prior year. In 2014, sales of the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), had a positive impact of 6.9% on the operational growth of the Pharmaceutical segment. 14 Medical Devices SegmentThe Medical Devices segment sales in 2015 were $25.1 billion, a decrease of 8.7% from 2014, which included an operational decline of 1.4% and a negative currency impact of 7.3%. U.S. sales were $12.1 billion, a decrease of 1.0% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $13.0 billion, a decrease of 14.8% as compared to the prior year, with an operational decrease of 1.7% and a negative currency impact of 13.1%. The divestitures of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics and the Cordis Businesses had a negative impact of 3.2% and 0.6%, respectively, on the worldwide operational growth of the Medical Devices segment as compared to 2014.

The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $9.3 billion in 2015, a decrease of 4.3% from 2014, which included operational growth of 1.7% and a negative currency impact of 6.0%. Operational growth in the U.S. and Europe regions was primarily driven by sales of the hip primary stem platform, the ATTUNE® Knee System, trauma TFNA nailing system and sports medicine ORTHOVISC®/MONOVISC® products. Growth was negatively impacted by softer demand and a reduction in customer inventory levels primarily in China and continued pricing pressures.The Surgery franchise sales were $9.2 billion in 2015, a decrease of 5.1% from 2014, which included operational growth of 2.7% and a negative currency impact of 7.8%. Operational growth in Advanced Surgery was driven by endocutter, biosurgical and energy products, primarily attributable to market growth, increased penetration in certain markets and new product launches. Operational growth in Specialty Surgery was primarily driven by Mentor products. Growth was partially offset by lower sales of women's health and urology products in General Surgery.The Vision Care franchise sales were $2.6 billion in 2015, a decrease of 7.5% from 2014, which included operational growth of 1.7% and a negative currency impact of 9.2%. Operational growth in all the major regions was primarily driven by new product launches partially offset by lower price.The Cardiovascular franchise sales were $2.0 billion, a decrease of 7.8% from 2014, which represented an operational decline of 0.1% and a negative currency impact of 7.7%. Strong operational growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by market growth and the success of the THERMOCOOL® SMARTTOUCH® Catheter and was offset by the impact of divesting the Cordis business. The Company completed the divestiture of the Cordis business to Cardinal Health on October 4, 2015. The Cordis business generated annual net revenues of approximately $535 million and $780 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. For additional details see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Diabetes Care franchise sales were $1.9 billion, a decrease of 10.0% from 2014, which represented an operational decline of 0.7% and a negative currency impact of 9.3%. The operational decline was primarily due to lower price partially offset by the success of the ANIMAS® VIBE® products. On June 30, 2014, the Company divested the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business (the Diagnostics Franchise) to The Carlyle Group. For additional details see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 15 The Medical Devices segment sales in 2014 were $27.5 billion, a decrease of 3.4% from 2013, which included an operational decline of 1.6% and a negative currency impact of 1.8%. U.S. sales were $12.3 billion, a decrease of 4.3% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $15.3 billion, a decline of 2.7% as compared to the prior year, with operational growth of 0.5% offset by a negative currency impact of 3.2%. In 2014, the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business had a negative impact of 3.2% on the operational growth of the Medical Devices segment.Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on IncomeConsolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income decreased to $19.2 billion as compared to $20.6 billion in 2014, a decrease of 6.6%. The decrease was primarily attributable to significantly lower sales of OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir), negative currency impacts, a restructuring charge of $0.6 billion and higher intangible asset write-downs of $0.1 billion in 2015 as compared to 2014. The decrease was partially offset by lower net litigation expense of $1.1 billion, lower Synthes integration costs of $0.6 billion, a positive adjustment of $0.4 billion to previous reserve estimates including Managed Medicaid rebates, and higher gains of $0.3 billion from divestitures as compared to the prior year. The fiscal year 2015 included higher gains of $0.3 billion primarily from the divestitures of the Cordis business, the SPLENDA® brand and the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA® versus the gains recorded in 2014 from the divestitures of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business and the K-Y® brand. Additionally, 2014 included an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $0.2 billion. Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income increased to $20.6 billion in 2014 as compared to $15.5 billion in 2013, an increase of 32.9%. Earnings before provision for taxes on income were favorable due to strong sales volume growth, particularly sales of OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir), positive mix from higher sales of higher margin products in the Pharmaceutical business, divestitures of lower margin businesses and cost reduction efforts across many of the businesses. Additionally, 2014 included higher net gains on divestitures of $2.3 billion, primarily the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business, lower litigation expense of $1.0 billion, lower in-process research and development costs of $0.4 billion and lower expenses of $0.1 billion related to the DePuy ASR™ Hip program as compared to the fiscal year 2013. This was partially offset by the inclusion of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $0.2 billion and $0.1 billion of higher Synthes integration/transaction costs in 2014. The fiscal year 2013 included a net gain of $0.4 billion on equity investment transactions, primarily the sale of Elan American Depositary Shares. As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income in 2015 was 27.4% versus 27.7% in 2014.Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses: Cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percent to sales were as follows:% of Sales 2015 2014 2013Cost of products sold 30.7% 30.6 31.3Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year 0.1 (0.7) (0.9)Selling, marketing and administrative expenses 30.3% 29.5 30.6Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year 0.8 (1.1) (0.4)In 2015, cost of products sold as a percent to sales increased slightly as compared to the prior year. Favorable mix between the segments was offset by $81 million associated with the restructuring activity in the Medical Devices segment, negative transactional currency and lower sales of OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) in 2015. Intangible asset amortization expense included in cost of products sold for 2015 and 2014 was $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. There was an increase in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily due to incremental investment spending in all the segments and the impact from lower sales of OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir), partially offset by favorable mix and the inclusion of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $0.2 billion in 2014.In 2014, cost of products sold as a percent to sales decreased compared to the prior year. This was primarily the result of positive mix from higher sales of higher margin products in the Pharmaceutical business, divestitures of lower margin businesses and cost improvements across many of the businesses. This was partially offset by pricing and the impact of negative transactional currency. In addition, 2013 included an inventory step-up charge of $0.1 billion related to the Synthes acquisition. Intangible asset amortization expense included in cost of products sold for both 2014 and 2013 was $1.4 billion. There was a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2014 compared to the prior year primarily due to leveraged costs resulting from growth in the Pharmaceutical business, particularly sales of OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir), and cost containment initiatives across many of the businesses. This was partially offset by the inclusion of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $220 million in the fiscal third quarter of 2014. 16 Research and Development Expense: Research and development expense by segment of business was as follows: 2015 2014 2013(Dollars in Millions) Amount % of Sales* Amount % of Sales* Amount % of Sales*Consumer $625 4.6% 629 4.3 590 4.0Pharmaceutical 6,821 21.7 6,213 19.2 5,810 20.7Medical Devices 1,600 6.4 1,652 6.0 1,783 6.3Total research and development expense $9,046 12.9% 8,494 11.4 8,183 11.5Percent increase/(decrease) over the prior year 6.5% 3.8 6.8 * As a percent to segment salesResearch and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. In 2015, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 6.5% compared to 2014. The increase as a percent to sales was attributable to increased investment spending primarily in the Pharmaceutical segment, lower overall sales and business mix. In 2014, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 3.8% compared to 2013. The reduction as a percent to sales was primarily due to strong sales growth in the Pharmaceutical business. Research spending in the Pharmaceutical segment increased in absolute dollars to $6.2 billion as compared to $5.8 billion primarily due to higher levels of spending to advance the Company's Pharmaceutical pipeline. In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In 2015, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion primarily for the discontinuation of certain development projects related to Covagen. In 2014, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion for the impairment of various IPR&D projects related to RespiVert, Crucell, Mentor and Synthes for the delay or discontinuation of certain development projects. In 2013, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.6 billion primarily for the impairment of various IPR&D projects related to Crucell, CorImmun and Acclarent for the delay or discontinuation of certain development projects. Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (formerly Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation), gains and losses on divestitures, transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2015 was a favorable change of $2.0 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower litigation expense of $1.1 billion, lower Synthes integration costs of $0.6 billion and higher JJDC portfolio gains of $0.2 billion as compared to the prior year. Additionally, the fiscal year 2015 included higher gains of $0.3 billion primarily from the divestitures of the Cordis business, the SPLENDA® brand and the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA® versus the gains recorded in 2014 from the divestitures of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business and the K-Y® brand. This was partially offset by higher intangible asset write-downs of $0.1 billion in 2015.The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2014 was a favorable change of $2.6 billion as compared to the prior year. The fiscal year 2014 included higher net gains on divestitures of $2.3 billion, primarily the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business, lower litigation expense of $1.0 billion and lower costs of $0.1 billion related to the DePuy ASR™ Hip program as compared to 2013. This was partially offset by higher Synthes integration/transaction costs of $0.2 billion and higher intangible asset write-downs of $0.1 billion primarily related to INCIVO® (telaprevir) in 2014. Additionally, the fiscal year 2013 included a higher net gain of $0.5 billion as compared to 2014 on equity investment transactions, primarily the sale of Elan American Depositary Shares. Interest (Income) Expense: Interest income in 2015 increased by $61 million as compared to 2014 due to a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $38.4 billion at the end of 2015, and averaged $35.7 billion as compared to the $31.1 billion average cash balance in 2014. The increase in the year-end cash balance was primarily due to cash generated from operating activities.Interest expense in 2015 increased slightly as compared to 2014. The average debt balance was $19.3 billion in 2015 versus $18.5 billion in 2014. The total debt balance at the end of 2015 was $19.9 billion as compared to $18.8 billion at the end of 2014. The higher debt balance of approximately $1.1 billion was an increase in commercial paper for general corporate purposes, primarily the stock repurchase program. Interest income in 2014 was comparable to the prior year. A higher balance in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was offset by lower interest rates. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $33.1 billion at the end of 17 2014, and averaged $31.1 billion as compared to the $25.2 billion average cash balance in 2013. The increase in the year-end cash balance was primarily due to cash generated from operating activities.Interest expense in 2014 increased by $51 million as compared to 2013 due to a higher average debt balance. The average debt balance was $18.5 billion in 2014 versus $17.2 billion in 2013. The total debt balance at the end of 2014 was $18.8 billion as compared to $18.2 billion at the end of 2013. The higher debt balance of approximately $0.6 billion was due to increased borrowings in November 2014. The Company increased borrowings, capitalizing on favorable terms in the capital markets. The proceeds of the borrowings were used for general corporate purposes.Income Before Tax by SegmentIncome before tax by segment of business were as follows: Percent of Segment Sales(Dollars in Millions) 2015 2014 2015 2014Consumer $1,787 1,941 13.2% 13.4Pharmaceutical 11,734 11,696 37.3 36.2Medical Devices 6,826 7,953 27.2 28.9Total (1) 20,347 21,590 29.0 29.0Less: Expenses not allocated to segments (2) 1,151 1,027 Earnings before provision for taxes on income $19,196 20,563 27.4% 27.7(1) See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.(2) Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense, noncontrolling interests, and general corporate (income) expense. Consumer Segment: In 2015, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 13.2%, versus 13.4% in 2014, primarily due to lower divestiture gains in 2015 versus 2014. In 2015, the Consumer segment tax included a gain of $0.3 billion from divestitures, primarily the divestiture of the SPLENDA® brand. In 2014, the Consumer segment included a gain of $0.5 billion from divestitures, primarily the divestiture of the K-Y® brand. In 2014, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 13.4%, flat to the prior year. Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2015, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 37.3% versus 36.2% in 2014. The favorable income before tax was primarily due to higher gains recognized in 2015 partially offset by a sales decline of OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD®(simeprevir), increased investment spending and negative currency impacts as compared to 2014. Included in 2015 was a gain of $1.0 billion on the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA®, as well as receipt of a contingent payment and a positive adjustment to previous reserve estimates, including Managed Medicaid rebates. Additionally, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax in 2014 was negatively impacted by $0.2 billion for an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee and higher intangible asset amortization expense of $0.3 billion primarily related to the write-down of INCIVO® (telaprevir). In 2014, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 36.2% versus 32.6% in 2013. The favorable income before tax was attributable to strong sales volume growth, particularly sales of OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir), positive sales mix of higher margin products and cost containment initiatives realized in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. This was partially offset by $0.2 billion for an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee and a $0.1 billion intangible asset write-down related to INCIVO® (telaprevir). Additionally, 2013 included a net gain of $0.4 billion on equity investment transactions, primarily the sale of Elan American Depositary Shares, and a positive adjustment of $0.2 billion to previous estimates for Managed Medicaid rebates, partially offset by higher write-downs of $0.4 billion for the impairment of IPR&D as compared to 2014. Medical Devices Segment: In 2015, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 27.2% versus 28.9% in 2014 primarily due to a restructuring charge of $0.6 billion, an intangible asset write-down of $0.3 billion related to Acclarent, and lower gains of $0.5 billion on divestitures as compared to 2014. In 2015, the Medical Devices segment included gains of $1.4 billion, primarily for the divestiture of the Cordis business versus a gain of $1.9 billion recorded in 2014 for the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business. The 2015 income before tax was favorably impacted by lower net litigation expense of $0.9 billion, which included a gain from the litigation settlement agreement of $0.6 billion with Guidant, and lower Synthes integration costs of $0.6 billion in 2015 as compared to 2014. 18 In 2014, Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 28.9% versus 18.5% in 2013. The favorable income before tax was attributable to the net gain of $1.9 billion on the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business in 2014 and lower litigation expense of $1.1 billion as compared to 2013. Restructuring: The Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment that are expected to result in annualized pre-tax cost savings of $800 million to $1.0 billion, the majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2018, including approximately $200 million savings in 2016. The savings will provide the Company with added flexibility and resources to fund investment in new growth opportunities and innovative solutions for customers and patients. The Company estimates that, in connection with its plans, it will record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion, most of which are expected to be incurred by 2017. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.6 billion, of which $81 million is included in cost of products sold. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring.Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 19.7% in 2015, 20.6% in 2014 and 10.6% in 2013. The 2015 effective tax rate decrease of 0.9% as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to the increases in taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions relative to higher tax jurisdictions and a tax benefit resulting from a restructuring of international affiliates. Additionally, the 2014 effective tax rate was affected by the items mentioned below. The increase in the 2014 effective tax rate, as compared to 2013, was attributable to the following: the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business at an approximate 44% effective tax rate, litigation accruals at low tax rates, the mix of earnings into higher tax jurisdictions, primarily the U.S., the accrual of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, which is not tax deductible, and additional U.S. tax expense related to a planned increase in dividends from current year foreign earnings as compared to the prior year. These increases to the 2014 effective tax rate were partially offset by a tax benefit of $0.4 billion associated with the Conor Medsystems divestiture.The 2014 effective tax rate was also reduced as the Company adjusted its unrecognized tax benefits as a result of (i) the federal appeals court’s decision in OMJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s litigation regarding credits under former Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), and (ii) a settlement of substantially all issues related to the Company’s U.S. Internal Revenue Service audit of tax years 2006 - 2009.The 2013 effective tax rate was reduced by a tax benefit associated with the write-off of assets for tax purposes associated with Scios, Inc., and the inclusion of both the 2013 and 2012 benefit from the Research and Development tax credit and the Controlled Foreign Corporation look-through provisions, because those provisions were enacted into law in January 2013 and were retroactive to January 1, 2012.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesLiquidity & Cash FlowsCash and cash equivalents were $13.7 billion at the end of 2015 as compared to $14.5 billion at the end of 2014. The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $0.8 billion decrease were approximately $19.3 billion of cash generated from operating activities offset by $7.7 billion net cash used by investing activities, and $10.8 billion net cash used by financing activities, and $1.5 billion due to the effect on exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the Company had $24.6 billion in marketable securities at the end of 2015 and $18.6 billion at the end of 2014. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.Cash flow from operations of $19.3 billion was the result of $15.4 billion of net earnings and $5.4 billion of non-cash charges and other adjustments for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and assets write-downs, primarily related to Acclarent and Venezuela write-downs, reduced by $2.6 billion from net gains on sale of assets/businesses, and $1.2 billion related to deferred taxes, accounts receivable and inventories. Additional sources of operating cash flow of $2.2 billion resulted from a decrease in other current and non-current assets and an increase in other current and non-current liabilities. Investing activities use of $7.7 billion was primarily for net purchases of investments in marketable securities of $6.7 billion, additions to property, plant and equipment of $3.5 billion, and acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $1.0 billion, partially offset by $3.5 billion of proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses. Financing activities use of $10.8 billion was primarily for dividends to shareholders of $8.2 billion and $5.3 billion for the repurchase of common stock. Financing activities also included a source of $1.4 billion from net proceeds of short and long-term debt and $1.3 billion of net proceeds from stock options exercised and associated tax benefits.On October 13, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $10.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. As of January 3, 2016, $1.0 billion has been repurchased under the program. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. Any shares acquired will be available for general corporate purposes. The Company intends to finance the share repurchase program through available cash and access to the capital markets. The previous share repurchase program approved on July 21, 2014, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock, was completed on April 28, 2015. 19 In 2015, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. The Company has a shelf registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that enables the Company to issue debt securities and warrants to purchase debt securities on a timely basis. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, existing credit facilities and access to the capital markets will provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs in 2016.Concentration of Credit RiskGlobal concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables continues to be limited due to the large number of customers globally and adherence to internal credit policies and credit limits. Economic challenges in Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal (the Southern European Region) have impacted certain payment patterns, which have historically been longer than those experienced in the U.S. and other international markets. The total net trade accounts receivable balance in the Southern European Region was approximately $1.3 billion as of January 3, 2016 and $1.8 billion as of December 28, 2014. Approximately $0.8 billion as of January 3, 2016 and approximately $1.1 billion as of December 28, 2014 of the Southern European Region net trade accounts receivable balance related to the Company's Consumer, Vision Care and Diabetes Care businesses as well as certain Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices customers which are in line with historical collection patterns.The remaining balance of net trade accounts receivable in the Southern European Region has been negatively impacted by the timing of payments from certain government owned or supported health care customers, as well as certain distributors of the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices local affiliates. The total net trade accounts receivable balance for these customers were approximately $0.5 billion at January 3, 2016 and $0.7 billion at December 28, 2014. The Company continues to receive payments from these customers and, in some cases, late payments with interest. For customers where payment is expected over periods of time longer than one year, revenue and trade receivables have been discounted over the estimated period of time for collection. Allowances for doubtful accounts have been increased for these customers, but have been immaterial to date. The Company will continue to work closely with these customers on payment plans, monitor the economic situation and take appropriate actions as necessary.Financing and Market RiskThe Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 3, 2016 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $15 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 3, 2016 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $18 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $115 million. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counter-parties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. Management believes the risk of loss is remote.The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $314 million.The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2015, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 15, 2016. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.Total borrowings at the end of 2015 and 2014 were $19.9 billion and $18.8 billion, respectively. The increase in borrowings between 2015 and 2014 was a result of financing for the Company's share repurchase program. In 2015, net cash 20 (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $18.5 billion compared to net cash of $14.3 billion in 2014. Total debt represented 21.8% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2015 and 21.2% of total capital in 2014. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2015 was $25.82 compared to $25.06 at year-end 2014, an increase of 3.0%.A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsThe Company’s contractual obligations are primarily for leases, debt and unfunded retirement plans. There are no other significant obligations. To satisfy these obligations, the Company will use cash from operations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of January 3, 2016 (see Notes 7, 10 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details):(Dollars in Millions) Debt Obligations Interest onDebt Obligations UnfundedRetirement Plans Operating Leases Total2016 $2,104 586 76 224 2,9902017 1,790 554 77 194 2,6152018 1,501 490 82 136 2,2092019 1,587 446 88 90 2,2112020 683 373 93 74 1,223After 2020 7,296 4,303 559 109 12,267Total $14,961 6,752 975 827 23,515For tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.DividendsThe Company increased its dividend in 2015 for the 53rd consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $2.95 per share in 2015 compared with dividends of $2.76 per share in 2014, and $2.59 per share in 2013. The dividends were distributed as follows: 2015 2014 2013First quarter$0.70 0.66 0.61Second quarter0.75 0.70 0.66Third quarter0.75 0.70 0.66Fourth quarter0.75 0.70 0.66Total$2.95 2.76 2.59On January 4, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.75 per share, payable on March 8, 2016, to shareholders of record as of February 23, 2016. The Company expects to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends.Other InformationCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when goods are shipped or delivered, and title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same period the related sales are recorded. 21 Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including prices charged by competitors. Rebates, which include the Medicaid rebate provision, are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2015, 2014 and 2013.Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the year incurred. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. The Company also earns service revenue for co-promotion of certain products. For all years presented, service revenues were less than 1% of total revenues and are included in sales to customers. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue.In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative fair value. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact. 22 Below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014.Consumer Segment(Dollars in Millions) Balance atBeginning of Period Accruals Payments/Credits Balance atEnd of Period2015 Accrued rebates (1) $122 581 (564) 139Accrued returns 77 84 (107) 54Accrued promotions 241 1,846 (1,675) 412Subtotal $440 2,511 (2,346) 605Reserve for doubtful accounts 18 5 (5) 18Reserve for cash discounts 22 206 (211) 17Total $480 2,722 (2,562) 640 2014 Accrued rebates(1) $137 619 (634) 122Accrued returns 80 102 (105) 77Accrued promotions 321 1,850 (1,930) 241Subtotal $538 2,571 (2,669) 440Reserve for doubtful accounts 25 5 (12) 18Reserve for cash discounts 24 215 (217) 22Total $587 2,791 (2,898) 480(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $31 million at January 3, 2016 and $37 million at December 28, 2014, recorded as a contra asset.Pharmaceutical Segment(Dollars in Millions) Balance atBeginning of Period Accruals Payments/Credits Balance atEnd of Period2015 Accrued rebates (1) $2,717 10,449 (9,715) 3,451Accrued returns 422 52 (70) 404Accrued promotions 34 127 (150) 11Subtotal $3,173 10,628 (9,935) 3,866Reserve for doubtful accounts 41 30 (25) 46Reserve for cash discounts 51 625 (613) 63Total $3,265 11,283 (10,573) 3,975 2014 Accrued rebates (1) $1,985 7,652 (6,920) 2,717Accrued returns 372 83 (33) 422Accrued promotions 96 34 (96) 34Subtotal $2,453 7,769 (7,049) 3,173Reserve for doubtful accounts 95 4 (58) 41Reserve for cash discounts 61 576 (586) 51Total $2,609 8,349 (7,693) 3,265(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $64 million at January 3, 2016 and $70 million* at December 28, 2014, recorded as a contra asset. *Prior year amount has been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 23 Medical Devices Segment(Dollars in Millions) Balance atBeginning of Period Accruals Payments/Credits Balance atEnd of Period2015 Accrued rebates(1) $844 5,216 (4,871) 1,189Accrued returns 188 556 (505) 239Accrued promotions 53 95 (101) 47Subtotal $1,085 5,867 (5,477) 1,475Reserve for doubtful accounts 216 13 (25) 204Reserve for cash discounts 16 877 (873) 20Total $1,317 6,757 (6,375) 1,699 2014 Accrued rebates(1) $801 4,663 (4,620) 844Accrued returns 180 395 (387) 188Accrued promotions 66 35 (48) 53Subtotal $1,047 5,093 (5,055) 1,085Reserve for doubtful accounts 213 62 (59) 216Reserve for cash discounts 18 815 (817) 16Total $1,278 5,970 (5,931) 1,317(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $411 million at January 3, 2016 and $354 million at December 28, 2014, recorded as a contra asset.Income Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.At January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014, the cumulative amounts of undistributed international earnings were approximately $58.0 billion and $53.4 billion, respectively. At January 3, 2016 and December 28, 2014, the Company's foreign subsidiaries held balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the amounts of $38.2 billion and $32.9 billion, respectively. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in international operations. If the Company decided at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company does not determine the deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings, as such determination is not practical. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Additionally, the Company records insurance receivable amounts from third-party insurers when recovery is probable. As appropriate, reserves against these receivables are recorded for estimated amounts that may not be collected from third-party insurers.The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued. 24 See Notes 1 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings.Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates and the effect a rate change to the health care cost trend would have on the Company’s results of operations.Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units the fair market value is calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant. The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of January 3, 2016.Economic and Market FactorsThe Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2005 - 2015, in the United States, the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for health care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.The Venezuelan government has established alternative systems and offerings of various foreign currency exchanges. During 2015, the Company primarily utilized the official government rate of 6.3 Bolivares Fuertes to one U.S. Dollar in preparing its consolidated financial statements. During 2014, the Company applied to settle an outstanding dividend payable at one of the alternative foreign exchange rates. As a result, the Company has applied this alternative exchange rate to translate certain transactions, as appropriate. Through the fourth quarter of 2015, the number of the Company’s transactions conducted at the official rate declined from prior quarters. As a result, the Company determined that it was no longer likely that all outstanding net monetary assets would be settled at the official government rate of 6.3 Bolivares Fuertes to one U.S. Dollar. Therefore, the Company recorded a charge of $161 million to revalue its net monetary assets in Venezuela at one of the government’s alternative exchange rates (SIMADI) and impair its non-monetary assets. After the revaluation, as of January 3, 2016, the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiaries represented less than 0.1% of the Company's consolidated assets and liabilities. Due to continuing uncertain economic conditions in Venezuela, it is possible that additional charges may be recorded in the future. Any additional charges are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s 2016 full year results. While the Company continues to do business in Greece, the Company closely monitors the economic situation. As of January 3, 2016, the Company’s Greek subsidiaries represented 0.3% and 0.4% of the Company's consolidated assets and revenues, respectively.The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2015 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $340 million and income by $90 million. 25 The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. For further information, see the discussion on “REMICADE® Related Cases” and “Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications” in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Legal ProceedingsJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for certain litigation matters and continues to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters currently disclosed for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties involved.In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.Common Stock Market PricesThe Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ.

Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations, financial performance, the Company’s strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approval, market position and expenditures.Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future events. The Company cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be accurate, although the Company believes that it has been reasonable in its expectations and assumptions. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or that known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the Company’s expectations and projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments.Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: economic factors, such as interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; competition, including technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges and uncertainties inherent in new product development, including uncertainty of clinical success and obtaining regulatory approvals; uncertainty of commercial success of new and existing products; challenges to patents; the impact of patent expirations; the ability of the company to successfully execute strategic plans, including restructuring plans; the potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to the restructuring may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; significant adverse litigation or government action, including related to product liability claims; impact of business combinations and divestitures; market conditions and the possibility that the on-going share repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued; significant changes in customer relationships or changes in behavior and spending patterns or financial distress of purchasers of health care products and services; changes to applicable laws and regulations, including global health care reforms; trends toward health care cost containment; increased scrutiny of the health care industry by government agencies; financial instability of international economies and legal systems and sovereign risk; manufacturing difficulties or delays, internally or within the supply chain; complex global supply chains with increasing regulatory requirements; product efficacy or safety concerns resulting in product recalls or regulatory action; disruptions due to natural disasters; and the potential failure to meet obligations in compliance agreements with government bodies.A discussion of these and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations can be found in this Report for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016, including in Exhibit 99. The Company notes these factors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 27 Item 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Financing and Market Risk” of this Report; and Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Financial Instruments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.",2023-12-30 16:53:27.151782

The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty (previously referred to as skin care), over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on five therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, cardiovascular, diabetes care and vision care fields which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments.In all of its product lines, the Company competes with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.Management’s Objectives The Company manages within a strategic framework with Our Credo as the foundation. The Company believes that our strategic operating principles: being broadly based in human health care, managing the business for the long term, having a decentralized management approach, and being committed to our people and values, are crucial to successfully meeting the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which we compete. To this end, management is focused on our long-term strategic growth drivers: creating value through innovation, expanding our global reach with a local focus, excellence in execution and leading with purpose. The Company is broadly based in human health care, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 22% of 2016 sales. In 2016, $9.1 billion, or 12.7% of sales, was invested in research and development, reflecting management’s commitment to delivering new and differentiated products and services to meet evolving health care needs and sustain the Company’s long-term growth. Our diverse businesses with more than 230 operating companies located in 60 countries are the key drivers of the Company’s success. Maintaining the Company’s decentralized management approach, while at the same time leveraging the extensive resources of the enterprise, positions the Company well to innovate, execute strategic plans and reach markets globally, as well as address the needs and challenges of the local markets. In order to remain a leader in health care, the Company strives to maintain a purpose-driven organization and is committed to developing global business leaders who can achieve these growth objectives. Businesses are managed for the long-term in order to sustain market leadership positions and enable growth, which provides an enduring source of value to our shareholders.Our Credo unifies all Johnson & Johnson employees in achieving these objectives, and provides a common set of values that serve as the foundation of the Company’s responsibilities to patients, consumers and health care professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. The Company believes that these foundational values, its strategic framework and long-term growth drivers, along with its overall mission of improving the quality of life for people around the world, will enable Johnson & Johnson to continue to be a leader in the health care industry. 14 Results of OperationsAnalysis of Consolidated SalesIn 2016, worldwide sales increased 2.6% to $71.9 billion, compared to a decrease of 5.7% in 2015 and an increase of 4.2% in 2014.

Operations in Venezuela negatively impacted the worldwide operational sales growth 0.3%. In 2015, the introduction of competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), had a negative impact of 2.7% on the worldwide operational sales growth. In 2015, the impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide operational sales growth was negative 2.0%. In 2014, sales of the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), had a positive impact of 2.8%, and the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business had a negative impact of 1.4% on the worldwide operational growth. Sales by U.S. companies were $37.8 billion in 2016, $35.7 billion in 2015 and $34.8 billion in 2014. This represents increases of 6.0% in 2016, 2.6% in 2015 and 9.0% in 2014. Sales by international companies were $34.1 billion in 2016, $34.4 billion in 2015 and $39.5 billion in 2014. This represents decreases of 0.9% in 2016, and 13.1% in 2015 and an increase of 0.4% in 2014.The five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 2.0%, 5.5% and (1.2)%, respectively. The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.0%, 2.4% and 3.8%, respectively.Sales by companies in Europe experienced a decline of 1.4% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 1.4%, offset by a negative currency impact of 2.8%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) experienced a decline of 5.1% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 4.0% offset by a negative currency impact of 9.1%. Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region achieved growth of 1.8% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 1.4% and a positive currency impact of 0.4%.The 2016 sales growth percentage as compared to the prior year was negatively impacted by approximately 1.3% from additional shipping days in 2015. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Annual Closing Date details). While the additional week in 2015 added a few days to sales, it also added a full week's worth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible.In 2016, the Company had two wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 13.5% and 10.7% of the total consolidated revenues. In 2015 and 2014, the Company had one wholesaler distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 12.5% and 11.0%, respectively, of the total consolidated revenues. 15 Analysis of Sales by Business SegmentsConsumer SegmentConsumer segment sales in 2016 were $13.3 billion, a decrease of 1.5% from 2015, which included 1.5% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 3.0%.

Operational growth was primarily driven by analgesics, anti-smoking aids and digestive health products. The Beauty franchise sales of $3.9 billion increased 7.3% as compared to the prior year, which included 9.4% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 2.1%. Operational growth was primarily due to sales from the recent acquisitions of Vogue International LLC, which contributed approximately 4.6%, and NeoStrata Company, Inc., as well as sales growth of NEUTROGENA®, AVEENO® adult products and DABAO® products. The Baby Care franchise sales were $2.0 billion in 2016, a decrease of 7.2% compared to the prior year, primarily due to competitive pressure partially offset by sales growth of AVEENO® baby products.The Oral Care franchise sales were $1.6 billion in 2016, a decrease of 0.8% as compared to the prior year, which included 2.0% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 2.8%. Operational growth was driven by increased sales of LISTERINE® products, attributable to new product launches and successful marketing campaigns. The Women’s Health franchise sales were $1.1 billion in 2016, a decrease of 11.1% as compared to the prior year, primarily due to operations in Venezuela and the U.S. divestiture of TUCKS®. The Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $0.8 billion in 2016, a decrease of 23.5% from 2015, primarily due to the SPLENDA® divestiture. Consumer segment sales in 2015 were $13.5 billion, a decrease of 6.8% from 2014, which included 2.7% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 9.5%.

Immunology products growth of 15.1% included operational growth of 15.9% and a negative currency impact of 0.8%. The strong growth of REMICADE®(infliximab), STELARA® (ustekinumab) and SIMPONI®/SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab)was primarily driven by immunology market growth and increased penetration for both STELARA® (ustekinumab) and SIMPONI®/SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab). 17 The patents for REMICADE®(infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE® have been introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE® in those markets. Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE® sales in markets outside the United States. The introduction of a biosimilar version of REMICADE® in the United States is subject to enforcement of patent rights, approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and compliance with the 180-day notice provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (the BPCIA). In April 2016, the FDA approved for sale in the United States an infliximab biosimilar to be marketed by a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. In October 2016, the period for notice of launch under the BPCIA passed and Pfizer Inc., began shipment of an infliximab biosimilar to wholesalers in the United States in late November 2016. Sales of an infliximab biosimilar in the U.S. market will result in a reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE®. The Company continues to assert REMICADE® related patent rights. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding the REMICADE® patents. Infectious disease products sales were $3.2 billion, a decline of 12.3% from 2015, which included an operational decrease of 11.2% and a negative currency impact of 1.1%. Competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), had a significant negative impact on sales. The decline of Hepatitis C sales was partially offset by sales growth of EDURANT®(rilpivirine) and PREZCOBIX®(darunavir/cobicistat).Neuroscience products sales were $6.1 billion, a decrease of 2.8% from 2015, which included an operational decrease of 2.3% and a negative currency impact of 0.5%. Strong sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA®/XEPLION®/ TRINZA®(paliperidone palmitate) were offset by lower sales of INVEGA® (paliperidone) due to generic competition, RISPERDAL CONSTA® (risperidone) and the impact of divestitures. Sales growth of CONCERTA®/methylphenidate was primarily due to a therapeutic equivalence reclassification of generic competitors.Oncology products achieved sales of $5.8 billion in 2016, representing an increase of 23.7% as compared to the prior year. Oncology products growth of 23.7% included operational growth of 25.2% and a negative currency impact of 1.5%. Contributors to the growth of Oncology products were strong sales of IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) and DARZALEX® (daratumumab) due to patient uptake, additional country launches and additional indications for IMBRUVICA®. Generic competition negatively impacted the sales growth of VELCADE®(bortezomib). Sales growth of ZYTIGA® (abiraterone acetate) in the Asia Pacific region, primarily due to the launch in China earlier this year, was partially offset by lower sales in Europe due to competition.Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $6.4 billion, a decline of 0.3% from 2015, which included an operational increase of 0.8% and a negative currency impact of 1.1%. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of XARELTO®(rivaroxaban) due to market share growth and INVOKANA®/INVOKAMET® (canagliflozin) due to market growth and continued uptake in the European Union and Canada. Sales of hormonal contraceptives were negatively impacted by generic competition and a higher adjustment to previous reserve estimates in 2015 as compared to 2016, which negatively impacted Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other by approximately 2.3%. 18 During 2016, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows:Product Name (Chemical Name)IndicationUS ApprovEU ApprovUS FilingEU FilingDARZALEX® (daratumumab)In combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapyü ü For the treatment of double refractory multiple myeloma ü darunavir STRSingle tablet regimen for HIV in treatment naive patients and treatment experienced patients üguselkumabTreatment of adults living with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis üüIMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib)Additional indication for first-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemiaüü Expanded label to include overall survival and combination data in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) ü Expanded label to include treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma in combination with bendamustine and rituximabüü INVOKAMET® (canagliflozin)Initial Therapy FDC with Metformin, Immediate Releaseü INVOKAMET® XR (canagliflozin)A once-daily therapy combining fixed doses of canagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride extended release for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetesü SIMPONI® (golimumab)Treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis ü SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab)Treatment of adults living with active psoriatic arthritis and the treatment of adults living with active ankylosing spondylitis ü sirukumabTreatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis üüSTELARA® (ustekinumab)Treatment of adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's diseaseüü Treatment of adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis ü TREVICTA® (paliperidone palmitate a 3 monthly injection)Maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients ü Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2015 were $31.4 billion, a decrease of 2.7% from 2014, which included operational growth of 4.2% offset by a negative currency impact of 6.9%. U.S. sales were $18.3 billion, an increase of 5.2%. International sales were $13.1 billion, a decrease of 12.0%, which included 3.0% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 15.0%. The Pharmaceutical segment operational growth was negatively impacted by 6.5% due to the introduction of competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), and positively impacted by 1.4% due to an adjustment to previous reserve estimates, including Managed Medicaid rebates primarily in the Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other therapeutic area. In 2015, divestitures had a negative impact of 0.3% on the worldwide Pharmaceutical segment operational growth. 19 Medical Devices SegmentThe Medical Devices segment sales in 2016 were $25.1 billion, a decrease of 0.1% from 2015, which included an operational increase of 0.9% and a negative currency impact of 1.0%. U.S. sales were $12.3 billion, an increase of 1.1% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $12.9 billion, a decrease of 1.2% as compared to the prior year, with an operational increase of 0.7% and a negative currency impact of 1.9%. In 2016, acquisitions and divestitures had a negative impact of 1.8% on the worldwide operational growth of the Medical Devices segment as compared to 2015. In 2016, the Medical Devices segment operational growth was negatively impacted by 0.9% due to additional shipping days in 2015.Major Medical Devices Franchise Sales: % Change(Dollars in Millions) 2016 2015 2014 ’16 vs. ’15 ’15 vs. ’14Orthopaedics $9,334 9,262 9,675 0.8 % (4.3) Hips 1,361 1,332 1,368 2.2 (2.6) Knees 1,524 1,496 1,533 1.9 (2.4) Trauma 2,569 2,528 2,640 1.6 (4.2) Spine & Other 3,880 3,906 4,134 (0.7) (5.5)Surgery 9,296 9,217 9,717 0.9 (5.1) Advanced 3,517 3,275 3,237 7.4 1.2 General 4,362 4,482 4,970 (2.7) (9.8) Specialty 1,417 1,460 1,510 (2.9) (3.3)Vision Care 2,785 2,608 2,818 6.8 (7.5)Cardiovascular 1,849 2,036 2,208 (9.2) (7.8)Diabetes Care 1,789 1,928 2,142 (7.2) (10.0)Diagnostics* 66 86 962 (23.3) (91.1)Total Medical Devices Sales $25,119 25,137 27,522 (0.1)% (8.7)* On June 30, 2014, the Company divested the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business (the Diagnostics Franchise)The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $9.3 billion in 2016, an increase of 0.8% from 2015, which included operational growth of 1.8% and a negative currency impact of 1.0%. Sales growth was primarily driven by market growth, U.S. sales of the trauma TFNA nailing system, worldwide sales of the hip primary stem platform and the ATTUNE® Knee System. Growth was negatively impacted by continued pricing pressures.The Surgery franchise sales were $9.3 billion in 2016, an increase of 0.9% from 2015, which included operational growth of 2.3% and a negative currency impact of 1.4%. Operational growth in Advanced Surgery was driven by endocutter, energy and biosurgery products, primarily attributable to market growth, increased penetration in certain markets and new product launches. The acquisition of NeuWave Medical, Inc. also contributed to growth. The operational decline in General Surgery was due to lower sales of women's health and urology products and pricing pressures partially offset by growth of sutures. The operational decline in Specialty Surgery was primarily due to lower sales of Acclarent products and Advanced Sterilization Products outside the U.S., divestitures and competitive pressures in Sterilmed partially offset by growth of Mentor products outside the U.S.The Vision Care franchise achieved sales of $2.8 billion in 2016, an increase of 6.8% from 2015, which included operational growth of 6.4% and a positive currency impact of 0.4%. Growth in all the major regions was primarily driven by new product launches. The Cardiovascular franchise sales were $1.8 billion, a decrease of 9.2% from 2015, which represented an operational decline of 9.2%. Strong operational growth in the electrophysiology business driven by market growth, share growth and new product launches was more than offset by the impact of divesting the Cordis business. The Company completed the divestiture of the Cordis business to Cardinal Health on October 4, 2015. For additional details see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Diabetes Care franchise sales were $1.8 billion, a decrease of 7.2% from 2015, which represented an operational decline of 5.9% and a negative currency impact of 1.3%. The operational decline was primarily due to price declines and competitive pressures. On January 26, 2017, subsequent to year-end, the Company announced it is engaging in a process to evaluate potential strategic options for the Diabetes Care franchise.The Medical Devices segment sales in 2015 were $25.1 billion, a decrease of 8.7% from 2014, which included an operational decline of 1.4% and a negative currency impact of 7.3%. U.S. sales were $12.1 billion, a decrease of 1.0% as 20 compared to the prior year. International sales were $13.0 billion, a decrease of 14.8% as compared to the prior year, with an operational decrease of 1.7% and a negative currency impact of 13.1%. The divestitures of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics and the Cordis Businesses had a negative impact of 3.2% and 0.6%, respectively, on the worldwide operational growth of the Medical Devices segment as compared to 2014. Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on IncomeConsolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income increased to $19.8 billion in 2016, as compared to $19.2 billion in 2015, an increase of 3.2%. The increase was primarily attributable to higher sales volume, favorable mix in the business and lower selling, marketing and administrative costs. This was partially offset by higher net litigation expense of $0.7 billion and a higher restructuring charge of $0.1 billion as compared to 2015. Additionally, the fiscal year 2015 included higher gains on the sale of assets/businesses as compared to 2016. The fiscal year of 2016 included gains of $0.6 billion from the divestitures of the controlled substance raw material and API business, certain anesthetic products in Europe and certain non-strategic Consumer brands versus gains of $2.6 billion recorded in 2015 primarily from the divestiture of the Cordis business, the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA® and the SPLENDA® brand. This was partially offset by a $0.3 billion intangible asset write-down related to Acclarent included in 2015.Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income decreased to $19.2 billion in 2015, as compared to $20.6 billion in 2014, a decrease of 6.6%. The decrease was primarily attributable to significantly lower sales of OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir), negative currency impacts, a restructuring charge of $0.6 billion and higher intangible asset write-downs of $0.1 billion in 2015 as compared to 2014. The decrease was partially offset by lower net litigation expense of $1.1 billion, lower Synthes integration costs of $0.6 billion, a positive adjustment of $0.4 billion to previous reserve estimates including Managed Medicaid rebates, and higher gains of $0.3 billion from divestitures as compared to the prior year. The fiscal year 2015 included higher gains of $0.3 billion primarily from the divestitures of the Cordis business, the SPLENDA® brand and the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA® versus the gains recorded in 2014 from the divestitures of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business and the K-Y® brand. Additionally, 2014 included an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $0.2 billion. As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income in 2016 was 27.5% versus 27.4% in 2015.Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses: Cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percent to sales were as follows:% of Sales 2016 2015 2014Cost of products sold 30.2% 30.7 30.6Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year (0.5) 0.1 (0.7)Selling, marketing and administrative expenses 27.7% 30.3 29.5Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year (2.6) 0.8 (1.1)In 2016, cost of products sold as a percent to sales decreased to 30.2% from 30.7% as compared to the same period a year ago. Favorable mix in the business and cost improvement programs was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of transactional currency. Intangible asset amortization expense of $1.2 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2016 and 2015. There was a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to cost management in all the segments and favorable mix. In 2015, cost of products sold as a percent to sales increased slightly as compared to the prior year. Favorable mix between the segments was offset by $81 million associated with the restructuring activity in the Medical Devices segment, negative transactional currency and lower sales of OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) in 2015. Intangible asset amortization expense included in cost of products sold for 2015 and 2014 was $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. There was an increase in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily due to incremental investment spending in all the segments and the impact from lower sales of OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir), partially offset by favorable mix and the inclusion of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee of $0.2 billion in 2014. 21 Research and Development Expense: Research and development expense by segment of business was as follows: 2016 2015 2014(Dollars in Millions) Amount % of Sales* Amount % of Sales* Amount % of Sales*Consumer $580 4.4% 625 4.6 629 4.3Pharmaceutical 6,967 20.8 6,821 21.7 6,213 19.2Medical Devices 1,548 6.2 1,600 6.4 1,652 6.0Total research and development expense $9,095 12.7% 9,046 12.9 8,494 11.4Percent increase/(decrease) over the prior year 0.5% 6.5 3.8 * As a percent to segment salesResearch and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. In 2016, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 0.5% compared to 2015 but decreased as a percent of sales. The decrease as a percent of sales was attributable to higher overall sales in the Pharmaceutical segment. The increased dollar spend in the Pharmaceutical segment was for investment spending to advance the pipeline. In 2015, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 6.5% compared to 2014. The increase as a percent to sales was attributable to increased investment spending primarily in the Pharmaceutical segment, lower overall sales and business mix.In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In 2016, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $29 million for the discontinuation of a development program related to Crucell. In 2015, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion primarily for the discontinuation of certain development projects related to Covagen. In 2014, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion for the impairment of various IPR&D projects related to RespiVert, Crucell, Mentor and Synthes for the delay or discontinuation of certain development projects. Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), gains and losses on divestitures, transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2016 was an unfavorable change of $2.5 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher gains on the sale of assets/businesses in the fiscal year 2015 as compared to 2016. The fiscal year of 2016 included gains of $0.6 billion from the divestitures of the controlled substance raw material and API business, certain anesthetic products in Europe and certain non-strategic Consumer brands versus gains of $2.6 billion recorded in 2015 primarily from the divestiture of the Cordis business, the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA® and the SPLENDA® brand. Additionally, the fiscal year of 2016 included higher litigation expense of $0.7 billion as compared to 2015. This was partially offset by a $0.3 billion intangible asset write-down related to Acclarent included the fiscal year 2015.The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2015 was a favorable change of $2.0 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower litigation expense of $1.1 billion, lower Synthes integration costs of $0.6 billion and higher JJDC portfolio gains of $0.2 billion as compared to the prior year. Additionally, the fiscal year 2015 included higher gains of $0.3 billion primarily from the divestitures of the Cordis business, the SPLENDA® brand and the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA® versus the gains recorded in 2014 from the divestitures of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business and the K-Y® brand. This was partially offset by higher intangible asset write-downs of $0.1 billion in 2015.Interest (Income) Expense: Interest income in 2016 increased by $240 million as compared to 2015 due to a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $41.9 billion at the end of 2016, and averaged $40.1 billion as compared to the $35.7 billion average cash balance in 2015. Interest expense in 2016 was higher as compared to 2015. The average debt balance was $23.5 billion in 2016 versus $19.3 billion in 2015. The total debt balance at the end of 2016 was $27.1 billion as compared to $19.9 billion at the end of 2015. The higher debt balance of approximately $7.2 billion was primarily due to increased borrowings in February and May of 2016. The Company increased borrowings, capitalizing on favorable terms in the capital markets. The proceeds of the borrowings were used for general corporate purposes, primarily the stock repurchase program.Interest income in 2015 increased by $61 million as compared to 2014 due to a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 22 $38.4 billion at the end of 2015, and averaged $35.7 billion as compared to the $31.1 billion average cash balance in 2014. The increase in the year-end cash balance was primarily due to cash generated from operating activities.Interest expense in 2015 increased slightly as compared to 2014. The average debt balance was $19.3 billion in 2015 versus $18.5 billion in 2014. The total debt balance at the end of 2015 was $19.9 billion as compared to $18.8 billion at the end of 2014. The higher debt balance of approximately $1.1 billion was an increase in commercial paper for general corporate purposes, primarily the stock repurchase program.

Consumer Segment: In 2016, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 18.3%, versus 13.2% in 2015, primarily driven by favorable selling, marketing and administrative expenses due to cost management and higher gross profit margins from cost improvement projects and favorable mix. This was partially offset by higher gains in 2015 related to divestitures, primarily the divestiture of the SPLENDA® brand. Additionally, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted the Consumer segment income before tax in 2016 as compared to 2015. In 2015, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 13.2%, versus 13.4% in 2014, primarily due to lower divestiture gains in 2015 versus 2014. In 2015, the Consumer segment tax included a gain of $0.3 billion from divestitures, primarily the divestiture of the SPLENDA® brand. In 2014, the Consumer segment included a gain $0.5 billion from divestitures, primarily the divestiture of the K-Y® brand.Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2016, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 38.3% versus 37.3% in 2015. The increase in income before tax was primarily due to strong sales volume growth and favorable selling, marketing and administrative expenses due to cost management. Additionally, the fiscal year 2015, had higher gains of $0.7 billion related to divestitures partially offset by a higher IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion as compared to 2016. The fiscal year of 2016 included the gains from the divestitures of the controlled substance raw material and API business and certain anesthetic products in Europe versus the gains recorded in 2015 from the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA®. In 2015, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 37.3% versus 36.2% in 2014. The favorable income before tax was primarily due to higher gains recognized in 2015 partially offset by a sales decline of OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD®(simeprevir), increased investment spending and negative currency impacts as compared to 2014. Included in 2015 was a gain of $1.0 billion on the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA®, as well as receipt of a contingent payment and a positive adjustment to previous reserve estimates, including Managed Medicaid rebates. Additionally, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax in 2014 was negatively impacted by $0.2 billion for an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee and higher intangible asset amortization expense of $0.3 billion primarily related to the write-down of INCIVO® (telaprevir). Medical Devices Segment: In 2016, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 22.2% versus 27.2% in 2015. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily due to lower gains of $1.4 billion related to divestitures, higher litigation expense of $0.8 billion and a higher restructuring charge of $0.1 billion as compared to 2015. This was partially offset by an intangible asset write-down of $0.3 billion related to Acclarent in 2015 and favorable selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2016. In 2015, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 27.2% versus 28.9% in 2014 primarily due to a restructuring charge of $0.6 billion, an intangible asset write-down of $0.3 billion related to Acclarent, and lower gains of $0.5 billion on divestitures as compared to 2014. In 2015, the Medical Devices segment included gains of $1.4 billion, primarily for the divestiture of the Cordis business versus a gain of $1.9 billion recorded in 2014 for the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business. The 2015 income before tax was favorably impacted by lower net litigation expense of 23 $0.9 billion, which included a gain from the litigation settlement agreement of $0.6 billion with Guidant, and lower Synthes integration costs of $0.6 billion in 2015 as compared to 2014. Restructuring: The Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment that are expected to result in annualized pre-tax cost savings of $800 million to $1.0 billion, the majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2018. Approximately $250 million in savings were realized in 2016. The savings will provide the Company with added flexibility and resources to fund investment in new growth opportunities and innovative solutions for customers and patients. The Company estimates that, in connection with its plans, it will record pre-tax restructuring related charges of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion, most of which are expected to be incurred by the end of 2017. In 2016, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $685 million, of which $45 million is included in cost of products sold and $149 million is included in other (income) expense. In 2015, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $590 million, of which $81 million was included in cost of products sold. Restructuring charges of $1.275 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring.Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 16.5% in 2016, 19.7% in 2015 and 20.6% in 2014. The 2016 effective tax rate decreased by 3.2% as compared to 2015. As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company adopted a new accounting standard for the reporting of additional tax benefits on share-based compensation that vested or were exercised during the fiscal year. The adoption of this new standard reduced the effective tax rate for the fiscal 2016 by 1.8% versus 2015. The remainder of the change in the effective tax rate was primarily related to the lower earnings before taxes in the United States and the settlement of several uncertain tax positions in 2016 versus 2015. The decrease in the 2015 effective tax rate, as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to the increases in taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions relative to higher tax jurisdictions and a tax benefit resulting from a restructuring of international affiliates. Additionally, the 2014 effective tax rate was affected by the items mentioned below. The increase in the 2014 effective tax rate, as compared to 2013, was attributable to the following: the divestiture of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business at an approximate 44% effective tax rate, litigation accruals at low tax rates, the mix of earnings into higher tax jurisdictions, primarily the U.S., the accrual of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, which is not tax deductible, and additional U.S. tax expense related to a planned increase in dividends from current year foreign earnings as compared to the prior year. These increases to the 2014 effective tax rate were partially offset by a tax benefit of $0.4 billion associated with the Conor Medsystems divestiture.The 2014 effective tax rate was also reduced as the Company adjusted its unrecognized tax benefits as a result of (i) the federal appeals court’s decision in OMJ Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s litigation regarding credits under former Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code and (ii) a settlement of substantially all issues related to the Company’s U.S. Internal Revenue Service audit of tax years 2006 - 2009.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesLiquidity & Cash FlowsCash and cash equivalents were $19.0 billion at the end of 2016 as compared to $13.7 billion at the end of 2015. The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $5.3 billion increase were approximately $18.8 billion of cash generated from operating activities offset by $4.8 billion net cash used by investing activities, and $8.6 billion net cash used by financing activities, and $0.2 billion due to the effect on exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the Company had $22.9 billion in marketable securities at the end of 2016 and $24.6 billion at the end of 2015. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.Cash flow from operations of $18.8 billion was the result of $16.5 billion of net earnings and $4.9 billion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and assets write-downs, reduced by $0.6 billion from net gains on sale of assets/businesses, $0.3 billion related to deferred taxes and $2.4 billion related to accounts receivable, inventories and other current and non-current liabilities. Additional sources of operating cash flow of $0.7 billion resulted from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a decrease in other current and non-current assets. Investing activities use of $4.8 billion was primarily for acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $4.5 billion and additions to property, plant and equipment of $3.2 billion. This was partially offset by proceeds from the net sale of investments primarily marketable securities of $1.8 billion and $1.3 billion of proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses. Financing activities use of $8.6 billion was primarily for dividends to shareholders of $8.6 billion and $9.0 billion for the repurchase of common stock. Financing activities also included a source of $7.9 billion from net proceeds of short and long-term debt and $1.2 billion of proceeds from stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, net.In 2016, the Company announced a definitive agreement to acquire Abbott Medical Optics Inc. for approximately $4.3 billion and on January 26, 2017, subsequent to year end the Company announced a definitive transaction agreement to acquire Actelion Ltd. for approximately $30.0 billion. Abbott Medical Optics closed on February 27, 2017. The Company will use cash held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries to pay for these acquisitions. 24 On October 13, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $10.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. As of January 1, 2017, $7.3 billion has been repurchased under the program. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be delayed or suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. Any shares acquired will be available for general corporate purposes. The Company intends to finance the share repurchase program through available cash and access to the capital markets. The previous share repurchase program approved on July 21, 2014, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock, was completed on April 28, 2015. In 2016, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. The Company had a shelf registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that expired on February 26, 2017. The Company plans to file a new shelf registration on February 27, 2017 which will enable it to issue debt securities on a timely basis. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, existing credit facilities and access to the capital markets will provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs in 2017.Concentration of Credit RiskGlobal concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables continues to be limited due to the large number of customers globally and adherence to internal credit policies and credit limits. Economic challenges in Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal (the Southern European Region) have impacted certain payment patterns, which have historically been longer than those experienced in the U.S. and other international markets. The total net trade accounts receivable balance in the Southern European Region was approximately $1.1 billion as of January 1, 2017 and $1.3 billion as of January 3, 2016. Approximately $0.7 billion as of January 1, 2017 and approximately $0.8 billion as of January 3, 2016 of the Southern European Region net trade accounts receivable balance related to the Company's Consumer, Vision Care and Diabetes Care businesses as well as certain Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices customers which are in line with historical collection patterns.The remaining balance of net trade accounts receivable in the Southern European Region has been negatively impacted by the timing of payments from certain government owned or supported health care customers, as well as certain distributors of the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices local affiliates. The total net trade accounts receivable balance for these customers were approximately $0.4 billion at January 1, 2017 and $0.5 billion at January 3, 2016. The Company continues to receive payments from these customers and, in some cases, late payments with interest. For customers where payment is expected over periods of time longer than one year, revenue and trade receivables have been discounted over the estimated period of time for collection. Allowances for doubtful accounts have been increased for these customers, but have been immaterial to date. The Company will continue to work closely with these customers on payment plans, monitor the economic situation and take appropriate actions as necessary.Financing and Market RiskThe Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 1, 2017 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $23 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 1, 2017 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $28 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $82 million. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counter-parties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. Management believes the risk of loss is remote.The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $336 million. 25 The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2016, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 14, 2017. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.Total borrowings at the end of 2016 and 2015 were $27.1 billion and $19.9 billion, respectively. The increase in borrowings between 2016 and 2015 was a result of financing for the Company's share repurchase program and general corporate purposes. In 2016, net cash (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $14.8 billion compared to net cash of $18.5 billion in 2015. Total debt represented 27.8% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2016 and 21.8% of total capital in 2015. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2016 was $26.02 compared to $25.82 at year-end 2015, an increase of 0.8%.A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsThe Company’s contractual obligations are primarily for leases, debt and unfunded retirement plans. There are no other significant obligations. To satisfy these obligations, the Company will use cash from operations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of January 1, 2017 (see Notes 7, 10 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details):(Dollars in Millions) Debt Obligations Interest onDebt Obligations UnfundedRetirement Plans Operating Leases Total2017 $1,704 799 83 216 2,8022018 1,561 735 84 179 2,5592019 2,538 680 89 134 3,4412020 629 608 94 105 1,4362021 1,795 574 100 88 2,557After 2021 15,919 6,956 610 100 23,585Total $24,146 10,352 1,060 822 36,380For tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

DividendsThe Company increased its dividend in 2016 for the 54th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $3.15 per share in 2016 compared with dividends of $2.95 per share in 2015, and $2.76 per share in 2014. The dividends were distributed as follows: 2016 2015 2014First quarter$0.75 0.70 0.66Second quarter0.80 0.75 0.70Third quarter0.80 0.75 0.70Fourth quarter0.80 0.75 0.70Total$3.15 2.95 2.76On January 3, 2017, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.80 per share, payable on March 14, 2017, to shareholders of record as of February 28, 2017. The Company expects to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends.Other InformationCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may 26 not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when goods are shipped or delivered, and title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same period the related sales are recorded.Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including prices charged by competitors. Rebates, which include the Medicaid rebate provision, are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2016, 2015 and 2014.Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the year incurred. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. The Company also earns service revenue for co-promotion of certain products. For all years presented, service revenues were 1% or less of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue.In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact. 27 Below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016.Consumer Segment(Dollars in Millions) Balance atBeginning of Period Accruals Payments/Credits Balance atEnd of Period2016 Accrued rebates (1) $139 615 (618) 136Accrued returns 54 111 (100) 65Accrued promotions 412 1,908 (1,962) 358Subtotal $605 2,634 (2,680) 559Reserve for doubtful accounts 18 12 (6) 24Reserve for cash discounts 17 209 (201) 25Total $640 2,855 (2,887) 608 2015 Accrued rebates(1) $122 581 (564) 139Accrued returns 77 84 (107) 54Accrued promotions 241 1,846 (1,675) 412Subtotal $440 2,511 (2,346) 605Reserve for doubtful accounts 18 5 (5) 18Reserve for cash discounts 22 206 (211) 17Total $480 2,722 (2,562) 640(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $37 million at January 1, 2017 and $31 million at January 3, 2016, recorded as a contra asset.Pharmaceutical Segment(Dollars in Millions) Balance atBeginning of Period Accruals Payments/Credits(2) Balance atEnd of Period2016 Accrued rebates (1) $3,451 12,306 (12,337) 3,420Accrued returns 404 140 (210) 334Accrued promotions 11 10 (21) —Subtotal $3,866 12,456 (12,568) 3,754Reserve for doubtful accounts 46 2 (10) 38Reserve for cash discounts 63 613 (618) 58Total $3,975 13,071 (13,196) 3,850 2015 Accrued rebates (1) $2,717 10,449 (9,715) 3,451Accrued returns 422 52 (70) 404Accrued promotions 34 127 (150) 11Subtotal $3,173 10,628 (9,935) 3,866Reserve for doubtful accounts 41 30 (25) 46Reserve for cash discounts 51 625 (613) 63Total $3,265 11,283 (10,573) 3,975(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $102 million at January 1, 2017 and $64 million at January 3, 2016, recorded as a contra asset.

The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.At January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016, the cumulative amounts of undistributed international earnings were approximately $66.2 billion and $58.0 billion, respectively. At January 1, 2017 and January 3, 2016, the Company's foreign subsidiaries held balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the amounts of $41.3 billion and $38.2 billion, respectively. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in international operations. If the Company decided at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company does not determine the deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings, as such determination is not practical. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Additionally, the Company records insurance receivable amounts from third-party insurers when recovery is probable. As appropriate, reserves against these receivables are recorded for estimated amounts that may not be collected from third-party insurers.The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued. 29 See Notes 1 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings.Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates and the effect a rate change to the health care cost trend would have on the Company’s results of operations.Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units the fair market value is calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant. The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of January 1, 2017.Economic and Market FactorsThe Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2006 - 2016, in the United States, the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for health care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.The Venezuelan government has established alternative systems and offerings of various foreign currency exchanges. Through the fourth quarter of 2015, the number of the Company’s transactions conducted at the official rate declined from prior quarters. As a result, the Company determined that it was no longer likely that all outstanding net monetary assets would be settled at the official government rate of 6.3 Bolivares Fuertes to one U.S. Dollar. Therefore in 2015, the Company recorded a charge of $161 million to revalue its net monetary assets in Venezuela at one of the government’s alternative exchange rates (SIMADI) and impair its non-monetary assets. After the revaluation, as of January 3, 2016, the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiaries represented less than 0.1% of the Company's consolidated assets and liabilities. While the Company continues to do business in Greece, the Company closely monitors the economic situation. As of January 1, 2017, the Company’s Greek subsidiaries represented 0.3% and 0.4% of the Company's consolidated assets and revenues, respectively.On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to as “Brexit.” Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have. Brexit creates global political and economic uncertainty, which may cause, among other consequences, volatility in exchange rates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in regulations. However, the Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or operating results. As of January 1, 2017, the business of the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries represented less than 3% of both the Company’s consolidated assets and fiscal twelve months revenues. 30 The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2016 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $330 million and income by $105 million.Governments around the world, including in the United States, consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. The Belgian government is currently considering a proposed change to its corporate tax code, including a proposal to lower its statutory tax rate. If enacted, the proposed change would result in revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets, with a corresponding charge to tax expense that may have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations for the period. Based on the deferred tax asset balances as of January 1, 2017, the Company estimates for every 1% that the statutory tax is lowered there will be additional one-time tax expense of approximately $60-75 million. A significant portion of the deferred tax asset described as “International R&D capitalized for tax” in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements is related to the Company’s operations in Belgium. The U.S. government is currently considering various proposals to changes in its corporate tax code. These proposals include but are not limited to lowering the statutory tax rate and the rules on how international income earned by the Company is taxed in the U.S. The impact of these proposals may have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations for the period and on future periods. As the Belgian or U.S. governments are still considering these proposals, it is not certain when or if they will be enacted. The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. For further information, see the discussion on “REMICADE® Related Cases” and “Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications” in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Legal ProceedingsJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for certain litigation matters and continues to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters currently disclosed for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties involved.In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings. 31 Common Stock Market PricesThe Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ.

The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, cardiovascular, diabetes care and vision care fields which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments.In all of its product lines, the Company competes with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.Management’s Objectives With “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to ensure health for people today and for future generations. United around this common ambition, the Company is poised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it competes. The Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 22% of 2017 sales. In 2017, $10.6 billion was invested in research and development and $35.2 billion spent on acquisitions, reflecting management’s commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. A critical driver of the Company’s success, is the 134,000 diverse employees that work across more than 260 operating companies, which are located in more than 60 countries. Employees are empowered and inspired to lead with the Company’s Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to use the Company’s reach and size to advance the Company's purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise, enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence. This ensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. 15 Results of OperationsAnalysis of Consolidated SalesIn 2017, worldwide sales increased 6.3% to $76.5 billion, compared to an increase of 2.6% in 2016 and a decrease of 5.7% in 2015. These sales changes consisted of the following:Sales increase/(decrease) due to: 2017 2016 2015Volume 8.0 % 3.2% 1.2 %Price (2.0) 0.7 0.6Currency 0.3 (1.3) (7.5)Total 6.3 % 2.6% (5.7)%In 2017, the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was a positive impact of 3.6%. In 2016, acquisitions and divestitures had a negative impact of 1.1% on the worldwide sales growth and competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), had a negative impact of 0.8% on the worldwide sales growth. Operations in Venezuela negatively impacted the worldwide sales growth 0.3%. In 2015, the introduction of competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), had a negative impact of 2.7% on the worldwide sales growth. In 2015, the impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was negative 2.0%. Sales by U.S. companies were $39.9 billion in 2017, $37.8 billion in 2016 and $35.7 billion in 2015. This represents increases of 5.4% in 2017, 6.0% in 2016 and 2.6% in 2015. Sales by international companies were $36.6 billion in 2017, $34.1 billion in 2016 and $34.4 billion in 2015. This represents an increase of 7.4% in 2017, and decreases of 0.9% in 2016, and 13.1% in 2015.The five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 2.6%, 6.0% and (0.4)%, respectively. The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 2.3%, 2.1% and 2.5%, respectively.In 2017, sales by companies in Europe achieved growth of 8.6% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 7.2% and a positive currency impact of 1.4%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) achieved growth of 5.4% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 2.8% and a positive currency impact of 2.6%. Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region achieved growth of 6.7% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 7.5% partially offset by a negative currency impact of 0.8%.The 2016 sales growth percentage as compared to the prior year was negatively impacted by approximately 1.3% from additional shipping days in 2015. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Annual Closing Date details). While the additional week in 2015 added a few days to sales, it also added a full week's worth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible. In 2017, the Company had two wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 14.0% and 10.0% of the total consolidated revenues. In 2016, the Company had two wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 13.5% and 10.7% of the total consolidated revenues. In 2015, the Company had one wholesaler distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 12.5% of the total consolidated revenues. 16 Analysis of Sales by Business SegmentsConsumer SegmentConsumer segment sales in 2017 were $13.6 billion, an increase of 2.2% from 2016, which included 1.3% operational growth and a positive currency impact of 0.9%.

The Over-the-Counter (OTC) franchise sales of $4.1 billion increased 3.7% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by analgesic products in the U.S., upper respiratory products outside the U.S., sales from the recent acquisition of Rhinocort and anti-smoking aids. The Baby Care franchise sales were $1.9 billion in 2017, a decrease of 4.2% compared to the prior year, primarily due to competitive pressure.The Oral Care franchise sales were $1.5 billion in 2017, a decrease of 2.4% as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by category declines and competitive pressure partially offset by new product launches outside the U.S. The Women’s Health franchise sales were $1.1 billion in 2017, a decrease of 1.6% as compared to the prior year, primarily due to category declines in EMEA and share loss in Brazil.The Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $0.8 billion in 2017, a decrease of 2.3% as compared to the prior year, primarily due to private label competitive pressure in the U.S. partially offset by BAND-AID® new product launches outside the U.S. Consumer segment sales in 2016 were $13.3 billion, a decrease of 1.5% from 2015, which included 1.5% operational growth offset by a negative currency impact of 3.0%.

Growth was driven by strong uptake of STELARA® (ustekinumab), the launch of TREMFYA® (guselkumab) and sales growth of SIMPONI®/SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab) outside the U.S. Lower sales of REMICADE® (infliximab) were due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition. The patents for REMICADE® (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE® have been introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE® in those markets. Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE® sales in markets outside the United States. In the United States, a biosimilar version of REMICADE® was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the U.S. market will result in a further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE®. The Company continues to assert REMICADE® related patent rights. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding the REMICADE® patents. Infectious disease products sales were $3.2 billion, a decline of 1.7% from 2016. Lower sales of OLYSIO® (simeprevir), vaccines and PREZISTA® (darunavir/cobicistat) were partially offset by sales growth of EDURANT®/rilpivirine, PREZCOBIX®/REZOLSTA® and the launch of SYMTUZA®. Neuroscience products sales were $6.0 billion, a decrease of 1.6% from 2016. Lower sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA® (risperidone) and CONCERTA®/methylphenidate as well as the impact of divestitures were partially offset by strong sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA®/XEPLION®/ TRINZA®/TREVICTA®(paliperidone palmitate) long-acting injectables. Oncology products achieved sales of $7.3 billion in 2017, representing an increase of 25.0% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth of Oncology products were strong sales of DARZALEX® (daratumumab) and IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) driven by market share and market growth and sales of ZYTIGA® (abiraterone acetate) driven by market growth. Several generic companies are challenging the remaining patent for ZYTIGA® in the USPTO and in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The Company is appealing a decision by the USPTO invalidating this patent, and the parties are awaiting a decision on a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement filed by the generic companies. In the event that the rulings are unfavorable to the Company, a generic launch is expected to follow. If there is a launch of a generic version of ZYTIGA® following FDA approval, it will result in a reduction in U.S. sales, and such reduction could occur in a short period of time. In 2017, the Company reported U.S. sales of $1.2 billion for ZYTIGA®. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding ZYTIGA®. Pulmonary Hypertension is a new therapeutic area which was established with the acquisition of Actelion Ltd on June 16, 2017. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the acquisition. Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $6.3 billion, a decline of 1.7% as compared to the prior year attributable to lower sales of INVOKANA®/INVOKAMET® (canagliflozin) in the U.S. primarily due to an increase in price discounts and market share decline driven by competitive pressure. This was partially offset by sales growth of XARELTO®(rivaroxaban) due to increased market growth and market share, as well as sales of non-PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension) products from the Actelion acquisition. 19 During 2017, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows:Product Name (Chemical Name)IndicationUS ApprovEU ApprovUS FilingEU Filing apalutamideAn oral androgen receptor inhibitor for men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ü DARZALEX® (daratumumab)In combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy ü In combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapiesü Frontline multiple myeloma transplant ineligible patients in combination with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone üüIMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib)Treatment for adult patients with chronic graft-versus-host-disease after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy ü Marginal zone lymphomaü INVOKANA® (canagliflozin)Reduce the risk of death in type 2 diabetes with established, or risk for, cardiovascular disease.

U.S. sales were $20.1 billion, an increase of 9.8%. International sales were $13.3 billion, an increase of 1.8%, which included 4.0% operational growth partially offset by a negative currency impact of 2.2%. In 2016, acquisitions, divestitures and competitive products to the Company's Hepatitis C products, OLYSIO®/SOVRIAD® (simeprevir) and INCIVO® (telaprevir), had a negative impact of 2.5% on the operational growth of the Pharmaceutical segment. In 2016, the Pharmaceutical segment operational growth was negatively impacted by 1.5% due to additional shipping days in 2015. The Pharmaceutical segment operational growth for 2016, as compared to the prior year, was not impacted by adjustments to previous reserve estimates as both periods included approximately $0.5 billion of adjustments. 20 Medical Devices SegmentThe Medical Devices segment sales in 2017 were $26.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from 2016, which included an operational increase of 5.7% and a positive currency impact of 0.2%. U.S. sales were $12.8 billion, an increase of 4.5% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $13.8 billion, an increase of 7.1% as compared to the prior year, with an operational increase of 6.7% and a positive currency impact of 0.4%. In 2017, acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 4.2% on the worldwide operational sales growth of the Medical Devices segment as compared to 2016.

Growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by endocutter, energy, including the acquisition of Megadyne Medical Products, Inc., and biosurgery products. Growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by sutures and sales from the acquisition of Torax Medical, Inc. The sales decline in Specialty Surgery was primarily due to lower sales of aesthetic, Advanced Sterilization and Sterilmed products. The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $9.3 billion in 2017, a decrease of 0.8% from 2016. The decline in Spine & Other was primarily due to the Codman Neurosurgery divestiture, share loss in U.S. Spine, pricing and competitive pressures. This was partially offset by sales growth of trauma, sports medicine products and U.S. hips.The Vision Care franchise achieved sales of $4.1 billion in 2017, an increase of 45.9% from 2016. Growth was driven by sales from the acquisition of AMO, with the majority of AMO sales in the surgical category, and new product launches in the contact lenses category.The Cardiovascular franchise sales were $2.1 billion, an increase of 13.4% from 2016. Strong growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by market growth and continued uptake of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH® Contact Force Sensing Catheter. The Diabetes Care franchise sales were $1.6 billion, a decrease of 9.7% from 2016. The decline was primarily due to price declines and competitive pressures. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company announced its decision to exit the Animas insulin pump business. Animas has selected Medtronic plc to facilitate a seamless transition for patients, caregivers and healthcare providers. The Company is continuing to evaluate potential strategic options for LifeScan, Inc. and determine the best opportunity to drive future growth and maximize shareholder value.The Medical Devices segment sales in 2016 were $25.1 billion, a decrease of 0.1% from 2015, which included an operational increase of 0.9% and a negative currency impact of 1.0%. U.S. sales were $12.3 billion, an increase of 1.1% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $12.9 billion, a decrease of 1.2% as compared to the prior year, with an operational increase of 0.7% and a negative currency impact of 1.9%. In 2016, acquisitions and divestitures had a negative 21 impact of 1.8% on the worldwide operational growth of the Medical Devices segment as compared to 2015. In 2016, the Medical Devices segment operational growth was negatively impacted by 0.9% due to additional shipping days in 2015.Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on IncomeConsolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income decreased to $17.7 billion in 2017, as compared to $19.8 billion in 2016, a decrease of 10.8%. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense and other charges related to recent acquisitions, higher selling, marketing and administrative costs due to investments in new product launches and higher research and development costs due to general portfolio progression and collaborations. Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income increased to $19.8 billion in 2016, as compared to $19.2 billion in 2015, an increase of 3.2%. The increase was primarily attributable to higher sales volume, favorable mix in the business and lower selling, marketing and administrative costs. This was partially offset by higher net litigation expense of $0.7 billion and a higher restructuring charge of $0.1 billion as compared to 2015. Additionally, the fiscal year 2015 included higher gains on the sale of assets/businesses as compared to 2016. As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income in 2017 was 23.1% versus 27.5% in 2016.Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses: Cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percent to sales were as follows:% of Sales 2017 2016 2015Cost of products sold 33.2% 30.2% 30.7Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year 3.0 (0.5) 0.1Selling, marketing and administrative expenses 28.0% 27.7% 30.3Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year 0.3 (2.6) 0.8In 2017, cost of products sold as a percent to sales increased to 33.2% from 30.2% as compared to the same period a year ago. The unfavorable increase was primarily driven by $2.3 billion of higher amortization expense and charges for inventory step-up related to the recent acquisitions, primarily Actelion. Intangible asset amortization expense of $3.0 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2017 as compared to $1.2 billion in 2016. There was an increase in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2017 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to investments in new product launches partially offset by favorable mix. In 2016, cost of products sold as a percent to sales decreased to 30.2% from 30.7% as compared to the same period a year ago. Favorable mix in the business and cost improvement programs was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of transactional currency. Intangible asset amortization expense of $1.2 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2016 and 2015. There was a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to cost management in all the segments and favorable mix. Research and Development Expense: Research and development expense by segment of business was as follows: 2017 2016 2015(Dollars in Millions) Amount % of Sales* Amount % of Sales* Amount % of Sales*Consumer $584 4.3% $580 4.4% 625 4.6Pharmaceutical 8,360 23.1 6,967 20.8 6,821 21.7Medical Devices 1,610 6.1 1,548 6.2 1,600 6.4Total research and development expense $10,554 13.8% $9,095 12.7% 9,046 12.9Percent increase/(decrease) over the prior year 16.0% 0.5% 6.5 * As a percent to segment salesResearch and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. In 2017, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 16.0% compared to 2016. The increase as a percent of sales was primarily in the pharmaceutical segment due to general portfolio progression as well as collaborative agreements entered into with Idorsia Ltd. and Legend Biotech. In 2016, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 0.5% compared to 22 2015 but decreased as a percent of sales. The decrease as a percent of sales was attributable to higher overall sales in the Pharmaceutical segment. The increased dollar spend in the Pharmaceutical segment was for investment spending to advance the pipeline. In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In 2017, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.4 billion primarily for the discontinuation of certain development projects related to Novira which was acquired in 2015. The product development was canceled due to safety concerns. In 2016, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $29 million for the discontinuation of a development program related to Crucell. In 2015, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion primarily for the discontinuation of certain development projects related to Covagen. Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), gains and losses on divestitures, transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2017 was a favorable change of $0.3 billion due to higher gains of $0.7 billion on the sale of assets/businesses, primarily the Codman Neurosurgery and COMPEED® divestitures, a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables and a higher gain of $0.3 billion related to the sale of certain investments in equity securities as compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by higher litigation expense of $0.4 billion, $0.3 billion of acquisition costs related to Actelion and AMO, an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin pump business and a higher restructuring related charge of $0.2 billion as compared to the fiscal year 2016. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2016 was an unfavorable change of $2.5 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher gains on the sale of assets/businesses in the fiscal year 2015 as compared to 2016. The fiscal year of 2016 included gains of $0.6 billion from the divestitures of the controlled substance raw material and API business, certain anesthetic products in Europe and certain non-strategic Consumer brands versus gains of $2.6 billion recorded in 2015 primarily from the divestiture of the Cordis business, the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA® and the SPLENDA® brand. Additionally, the fiscal year of 2016 included higher litigation expense of $0.7 billion as compared to 2015. This was partially offset by a $0.3 billion intangible asset write-down related to Acclarent included in the fiscal year 2015.Interest (Income) Expense: Interest income in 2017 increased slightly as compared to 2016 due to higher average interest rates partially offset by lower cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during the period. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $18.3 billion at the end of 2017, and averaged $30.1 billion as compared to the $40.1 billion average cash balance in 2016. The decrease in the balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was due to the use of cash for general corporate purposes including acquisitions, primarily the Actelion acquisition for $29.6 billion, net of cash acquired.Interest expense in 2017 was higher as compared to 2016. The average debt balance was $30.9 billion in 2017 versus $23.5 billion in 2016. The total debt balance at the end of 2017 was $34.6 billion as compared to $27.1 billion at the end of 2016. The higher debt balance of approximately $7.5 billion was primarily due to increased borrowings. The Company increased borrowings in February and November of 2017, capitalizing on favorable terms in the capital markets. The proceeds of the borrowings were used for general corporate purposes, including the completion of the stock repurchase program.Interest income in 2016 increased by $0.2 billion as compared to 2015 due to a higher average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $41.9 billion at the end of 2016, and averaged $40.1 billion as compared to the $35.7 billion average cash balance in 2015. Interest expense in 2016 was higher as compared to 2015. The average debt balance was $23.5 billion in 2016 versus $19.3 billion in 2015. The total debt balance at the end of 2016 was $27.1 billion as compared to $19.9 billion at the end of 2015. The higher debt balance of approximately $7.2 billion was primarily due to increased borrowings in February and May of 2016. The Company increased borrowings, capitalizing on favorable terms in the capital markets. The proceeds of the borrowings were used for general corporate purposes, primarily the stock repurchase program. 23 Income Before Tax by SegmentIncome before tax by segment of business were as follows: Income Before Tax Segment Sales Percent of Segment Sales(Dollars in Millions) 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017 2016Consumer $2,524 2,441 $13,602 13,307 18.6% 18.3Pharmaceutical 11,083 12,827 36,256 33,464 30.6 38.3Medical Devices 5,392 5,578 26,592 25,119 20.3 22.2Total (1) 18,999 20,846 76,450 71,890 24.9 29.0Less: Expenses not allocated to segments (2) 1,326 1,043 Earnings before provision for taxes on income $17,673 19,803 $76,450 71,890 23.1% 27.5(1) See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.(2) Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense and general corporate (income) expense. Increase in 2017 was primarily due to higher interest expense of $0.2 billion on higher debt balance. Consumer Segment: In 2017, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 18.6%, versus 18.3% in 2016. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales in 2017 as compared to 2016 was attributable to higher gains on divestitures, primarily the divestiture of COMPEED® in 2017. This was partially offset by higher selling, marketing and administrative expenses as compared to the prior year due to increased advertising and promotional spending and slightly higher amortization expense in 2017 related to acquisitions. Additionally, the fiscal year 2016 was negatively impacted by operations in Venezuela. In 2016, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 18.3%, versus 13.2% in 2015, primarily driven by favorable selling, marketing and administrative expenses due to cost management and higher gross profit margins from cost improvement projects and favorable mix. This was partially offset by higher gains in 2015 related to divestitures, primarily the divestiture of the SPLENDA® brand. Additionally, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted the Consumer segment income before tax in 2016 as compared to 2015. Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2017, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 30.6% versus 38.3% in 2016. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily due to $2.3 billion of higher amortization expense and other costs related to the Actelion acquisition, higher research and development expense, a higher IPR&D charge of $0.4 billion related to Novira and lower gains on divestitures as compared to the prior year. Additionally, the fiscal year 2016 included a positive adjustment of $0.5 billion to previous reserve estimates. This was partially offset by a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables, a higher gain of $0.2 billion related to the sale of certain investments in equity securities and favorable product mix in 2017. In 2016, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 38.3% versus 37.3% in 2015. The increase in income before tax was primarily due to strong sales volume growth and favorable selling, marketing and administrative expenses due to cost management. Additionally, the fiscal year 2015, had higher gains of $0.7 billion related to divestitures partially offset by a higher IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion as compared to 2016. The fiscal year of 2016 included the gains from the divestitures of the controlled substance raw material and API business and certain anesthetic products in Europe versus the gains recorded in 2015 from the U.S. divestiture of NUCYNTA®. Medical Devices Segment: In 2017, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 20.3% versus 22.2% in 2016. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily due to $0.3 billion of higher amortization expense and other acquisition costs related to AMO, $0.3 billion of higher litigation, an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin pump business, $0.1 billion of higher restructuring and investments in new product launches as compared to the fiscal year 2016. This was partially offset by $0.8 billion higher gains in 2017 related to divestitures, primarily the divestiture of Codman Neurosurgery.In 2016, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 22.2% versus 27.2% in 2015. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily due to lower gains of $1.4 billion related to divestitures, higher litigation expense of $0.8 billion and a higher restructuring charge of $0.1 billion as compared to 2015. This was partially offset by an intangible asset write-down of $0.3 billion related to Acclarent in 2015 and favorable selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2016. 24 Restructuring: In the first quarter of 2016, the Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment. The restructuring actions are expected to result in annualized pre-tax cost savings of $800 million to $1.0 billion, the majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2018. Approximately $500 million in savings were realized in 2017. The savings will provide the Company with added flexibility and resources to fund investment in new growth opportunities and innovative solutions for customers and patients. The Company estimates that, in connection with its plans, it will record pre-tax restructuring related charges of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion. In 2017, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $760 million, of which $88 million is included in cost of products sold and $363 million is included in other (income) expense. In 2016, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $685 million, of which $45 million is included in cost of products sold and $149 million is included in other (income) expense. In 2015, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $590 million, of which $81 million was included in cost of products sold. Restructuring related charges of $2.0 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring.Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 92.6% in 2017, 16.5% in 2016 and 19.7% in 2015. The 2017 effective tax rate increased by 76.1% as compared to 2016, primarily driven by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in the United States in December 2017. The enactment of the TCJA resulted in a provisional tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017, of approximately $13.0 billion or approximately 73.3 percentage point increase to the effective tax rate. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the TCJA. The remainder of the increase in the tax rate for 2017 was related to the remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets in Belgium, as a result of changes in the Belgian statutory corporate tax rate, enacted in December 2017, offset by a tax benefit for the closure of the Company’s Animas insulin pump business. The government in Switzerland is currently considering tax reform legislation, which could have a material impact on the Company’s effective tax rate if enacted into law.The decrease in the 2016 effective tax rate, as compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to the Company adopting a new accounting standard for the reporting of additional tax benefits on share-based compensation that vested or were exercised during the fiscal year. The remainder of the change in the effective tax rate was primarily related to the lower earnings before taxes in the United States and the settlement of several uncertain tax positions in 2016 versus 2015. The decrease in the 2015 effective tax rate, as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to the increases in taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions relative to higher tax jurisdictions and a tax benefit resulting from a restructuring of international affiliates. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesLiquidity & Cash FlowsCash and cash equivalents were $17.8 billion at the end of 2017 as compared to $19.0 billion at the end of 2016. The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $1.2 billion decrease were approximately $21.1 billion of cash generated from operating activities and $0.3 billion due to the effect on exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents offset by $14.9 billion net cash used by investing activities and $7.7 billion net cash used by financing activities. In addition, the Company had $0.5 billion in marketable securities at the end of 2017 and $22.9 billion at the end of 2016. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.Cash flow from operations of $21.1 billion was the result of $1.3 billion of net earnings and $9.8 billion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, assets write-downs and deferred tax provision, reduced by $1.3 billion from net gains on sale of assets/businesses and $1.0 billion related to an increase in accounts receivable and an increase in other current and non-current assets. Additional sources of operating cash flow of $12.3 billion resulted from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, a decrease in inventories and an increase in other current and non-current liabilities. The increase in accrued liabilities and non-current liabilities is primarily due to the 2017 U.S. tax legislation (TCJA). The U.S. tax of $10.1 billion is payable over 8 years. Additionally, foreign taxes of $3.4 billion, net were recorded in the deferred tax provision. Investing activities use of $14.9 billion was for acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $35.2 billion (primarily the acquisitions of Actelion and AMO for approximately $29.6 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively) and additions to property, plant and equipment of $3.3 billion. This was partially offset by proceeds from the net sale of investments primarily marketable securities of $22.0 billion and $1.8 billion of proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses (primarily the divestitures of Codman Neurosurgery and COMPEED®). Financing activities use of $7.7 billion was primarily for dividends to shareholders of $8.9 billion, $6.4 billion for the repurchase of common stock and $0.2 billion of other financing. Financing activities also included sources of $6.8 billion from net proceeds of short and long-term debt and $1.1 billion of proceeds from stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, net.On October 13, 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $10.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. As of July 2, 2017, $10.0 billion was repurchased under the program and the program was completed. Shares acquired are available for general corporate purposes. 25 As of December 31, 2017, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. In 2017, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Additionally, as a result of the TCJA, the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs for the next twelve months. The Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. The Company filed a new shelf registration on February 27, 2017 which will enable it to issue debt securities on a timely basis. In the fiscal first and fourth quarters of 2017, the Company issued bonds for a total of $9.0 billion for general corporate purposes, including the completion of the stock repurchase program. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Financing and Market RiskThe Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 31, 2017 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $167 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 31, 2017 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $197 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $69 million. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counter-parties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. Management believes the risk of loss is remote.The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $8 million. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2017, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 13, 2018. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.Total borrowings at the end of 2017 and 2016 were $34.6 billion and $27.1 billion, respectively. The increase in borrowings between 2017 and 2016 was a result of financing for the Company's share repurchase program and general corporate purposes. In 2017, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $16.3 billion compared to net cash of $14.8 billion in 2016. Total debt represented 36.5% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2017 and 27.8% of total capital in 2016. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2017 was $22.43 compared to $26.02 at year-end 2016, a decrease of 13.8%.A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 26 Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsThe Company’s contractual obligations are primarily for the recently enacted tax legislation, leases, debt and unfunded retirement plans. There are no other significant obligations. To satisfy these obligations, the Company will use cash from operations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of December 31, 2017 (see Notes 7, 8, 10 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details):(Dollars in Millions) Tax Legislation (TCJA) Debt Obligations Interest onDebt Obligations UnfundedRetirement Plans Operating Leases Total2018 $1,614 1,499 1,002 88 227 4,4302019 807 2,752 949 89 184 4,7812020 807 1,105 883 94 143 3,0322021 807 1,797 840 100 106 3,6502022 1,513 2,189 796 108 76 4,682After 2022 4,538 22,832 9,659 651 103 37,783Total $10,086 32,174 14,129 1,130 839 58,358For tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

DividendsThe Company increased its dividend in 2017 for the 55th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $3.32 per share in 2017 compared with dividends of $3.15 per share in 2016, and $2.95 per share in 2015. The dividends were distributed as follows: 2017 2016 2015First quarter$0.80 0.75 0.70Second quarter0.84 0.80 0.75Third quarter0.84 0.80 0.75Fourth quarter0.84 0.80 0.75Total$3.32 3.15 2.95On January 2, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.84 per share, payable on March 13, 2018, to shareholders of record as of February 27, 2018. The Company expects to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends. 27 Other InformationCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when goods are shipped or delivered, and title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same period the related sales are recorded. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Accounting Standards Update related to revenue which will be adopted in 2018.Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including prices charged by competitors. Rebates, which include the Medicaid rebate provision, are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2017, 2016 and 2015.Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the year incurred. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. The Company also earns service revenue for co-promotion of certain products. For all years presented, service revenues were approximately 1% or less of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue.In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact. 28 Below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017.Consumer Segment(Dollars in Millions) Balance atBeginning of Period Accruals Payments/Credits Balance atEnd of Period2017 Accrued rebates (1) $136 638 (588) 186Accrued returns 65 128 (125) 68Accrued promotions 358 2,148 (2,025) 481Subtotal $559 2,914 (2,738) 735Reserve for doubtful accounts 24 10 (3) 31Reserve for cash discounts 25 205 (207) 23Total $608 3,129 (2,948) 789 2016 Accrued rebates(1) $139 615 (618) 136Accrued returns 54 111 (100) 65Accrued promotions 412 1,908 (1,962) 358Subtotal $605 2,634 (2,680) 559Reserve for doubtful accounts 18 12 (6) 24Reserve for cash discounts 17 209 (201) 25Total $640 2,855 (2,887) 608(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $48 million at December 31, 2017 and $37 million at January 1, 2017, recorded as a contra asset.Pharmaceutical Segment(Dollars in Millions) Balance atBeginning of Period Accruals Payments/Credits(2) Balance atEnd of Period2017 Accrued rebates (1) $3,420 16,447 (15,005) 4,862Accrued returns 334 256 (228) 362Accrued promotions — 69 (34) 35Subtotal $3,754 16,772 (15,267) 5,259Reserve for doubtful accounts 38 40 (1) 77Reserve for cash discounts 58 714 (717) 55Total $3,850 17,526 (15,985) 5,391 2016 Accrued rebates (1) $3,451 12,306 (12,337) 3,420Accrued returns 404 140 (210) 334Accrued promotions 11 10 (21) —Subtotal $3,866 12,456 (12,568) 3,754Reserve for doubtful accounts 46 2 (10) 38Reserve for cash discounts 63 613 (618) 58Total $3,975 13,071 (13,196) 3,850(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $90 million at December 31, 2017 and $102 million at January 1, 2017, recorded as a contra asset.

The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.In the fourth quarter of 2017, the United States enacted the TCJA, which includes provisions for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings in foreign jurisdictions. The Company has provisionally booked a $10.1 billion charge on these undistributed earnings in 2017. Additionally, the Company has provisionally recorded a $4.5 billion deferred tax liability for foreign local and withholding taxes, offset by a $1.1 billion deferred tax asset for U.S. foreign tax credits, for repatriation of substantially all undistributed foreign earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the remaining undistributed foreign earnings for which it has not provided deferred taxes for foreign local and withholding tax, as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The amount of these unrecorded deferred taxes is not expected to be material. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued.See Notes 1 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings. 30 Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates and the effect a rate change to the health care cost trend would have on the Company’s results of operations.Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units the fair market value is calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant. The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 31, 2017.Economic and Market FactorsThe Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2007 - 2017, in the United States, the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for health care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.In June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to as “Brexit” and in March 2017 the U.K. formally started the process for the U.K. to leave the E.U. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have. Brexit creates global political and economic uncertainty, which may cause, among other consequences, volatility in exchange rates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in regulations. However, the Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or operating results. As of December 31, 2017, the business of the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries represented less than 3% of both the Company’s consolidated assets and fiscal twelve months revenues, respectively.The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2017 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $360 million and income by $105 million.Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. 31 The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. For further information, see the discussion on “REMICADE® Related Cases” and “Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications” in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Legal ProceedingsJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for certain litigation matters and continues to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters currently disclosed for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties involved.In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.Common Stock Market PricesThe Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ.

200406,JNJ,JOHNSON & JOHNSON,2019,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Report. The Company's subsidiaries generally seek to own, rather than lease, their manufacturing facilities, although some, principally in non-U.S. locations, are leased. Office and warehouse facilities are often leased. The Company also engages contract manufacturers.The Company is committed to maintaining all of its properties in good operating condition.McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (McNEIL-PPC) continues to operate under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the FDA, which governs certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations, and requires McNEIL-PPC to remediate the facilities it operates in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, and Las Piedras, Puerto Rico (the ""Consent Decree""). Following FDA inspections in 2015, McNEIL-PPC received notifications from the FDA that all three manufacturing facilities are in conformity with applicable laws and regulations, and commercial production has restarted. Under the Consent Decree, after receiving notice from the FDA of being in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, each of the three facilities is subject to a five-year audit period by a third-party cGMP expert. Thus, a third-party expert will continue to reassess the sites at various times until at least 2020. For information regarding lease obligations, see Note 16 “Rental Expense and Lease Commitments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.

CONDITIONOrganization and Business SegmentsDescription of the Company and Business SegmentsJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 135,100 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular), diabetes care (divested in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018) and vision fields which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments.In all of its product lines, the Company competes with companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.Management’s Objectives With “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity.

New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2018 sales. In 2018, $10.8 billion was invested in research and development and $0.9 billion spent on acquisitions, reflecting management’s commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. A critical driver of the Company’s success, is the 135,100 diverse employees that work across more than 260 operating companies, which are located in more than 60 countries. Employees are empowered and inspired to lead with the Company’s Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to use the Company’s reach and size to advance the Company's purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise, enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence.

Growth was driven by strong uptake of STELARA® (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease, strong launch uptake of TREMFYA® (guselkumab), expanded indications of SIMPONI®/SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab), and the U.S. immunology market growth. Immunology was negatively impacted by lower sales of REMICADE® (infliximab) due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition. The patents for REMICADE® (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE® have been introduced in certain markets outside the U.S., resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE® in those markets. Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE® sales in markets outside the United States. In the U.S., a biosimilar version of REMICADE® was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the U.S. market will result in a further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE®. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding the REMICADE® patents. Infectious disease products sales were $3.3 billion in 2018, representing an increase of 4.8% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of PREZCOBIX®/REZOLSTA® (darunavir/cobicistat), EDURANT®/rilpivirine, and the launch of SYMTUZA® and JULUCA® (dolutegravir/rilpivirine) was partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA®(darunavir).Neuroscience products sales were $6.1 billion, representing an increase of 1.5% as compared to the prior year. Strong sales of long-acting injectables INVEGA TRINZA®/TREVICTA®(paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA SUSTENNA®/XEPLION® were partially offset by cannibalization of RISPERDAL CONSTA® (risperidone) and generic competition for CONCERTA®/methylphenidate.Oncology products achieved sales of $9.8 billion in 2018, representing an increase of 35.6% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX® (daratumumab) with continued market growth and share gain, IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) due to increased patient uptake globally and sales of ZYTIGA® (abiraterone acetate) driven by LATITUDE data and market growth. Additionally, sales from the launch of ERLEADA™ (apalutamide) contributed to the growth. A number of companies marketing generic pharmaceuticals have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the FDA, or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the U.S., seeking to market generic forms of ZYTIGA® prior to expiration of its applicable patents. These ANDAs include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the applicable patents. In October 2018, the Court issued a ruling invalidating all asserted claims of the applicable patent. Janssen has appealed the Court’s decision. In November 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied Janssen’s request for an injunction pending appeal. As a result, several generic versions of ZYTIGA® have entered the market, resulting in a decline in sales of ZYTIGA® in the United States. In 2018, the Company reported U.S. sales of $1.8 billion for ZYTIGA®. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding ZYTIGA®. The Pulmonary Hypertension therapeutic area was established with the acquisition of Actelion Ltd on June 16, 2017. Sales in 2018 represented a full year as compared to half a year in 2017. Sales of OPSUMIT® (macitentan) and UPTRAVI® (selexipag) were positively impacted by market growth and share gains while sales of TRACLEER® (bosetan) were negatively impacted by increased use of OPSUMIT® and generics. Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $5.8 billion, a decline of 7.5% as compared to the prior year. Lower sales of INVOKANA®/INVOKAMET® (canagliflozin) in the U.S. was primarily due to an increase in price discounts, higher rebates and market share decline driven by competitive pressure. Lower sales of XARELTO® (rivaroxaban) were driven by an increase in discounts and rebates, partially offset by an increase in market share. 20 During 2018, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows:Product Name (Chemical Name)IndicationUS ApprovalEU ApprovalUS FilingEU FilingDARZALEX® (daratumumab)Frontline multiple myeloma transplant ineligible patients in combination with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisoneŸŸ erdafitinibTreatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer Ÿ ERLEADA™ (apalutamide)Treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancerŸ ŸesketamineAntidepressant for treatment-resistant depression in adults ŸŸIMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib)Treatment of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia used in combination with rituximab Ÿ Ÿ Treatment for previously untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in combination with obinutuzumab ŸŸINVOKANA® (canagliflozin)Reduce the risk of death in type 2 diabetes with established, or risk for, cardiovascular disease.

U.S. sales were $21.5 billion, an increase of 6.7%. International sales were $14.8 billion, an increase of 10.8%, which included 10.1% operational growth and a positive currency impact of 0.7%. In 2017, acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 3.8% on the operational sales growth of the worldwide Pharmaceutical segment. Adjustments to previous reserve estimates, as compared to the prior year, negatively impacted the reported Pharmaceutical segment operational growth by approximately 1.8%, primarily in the Immunology and Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other therapeutic areas. 21 Medical Devices SegmentThe Medical Devices segment sales in 2018 were $27.0 billion, an increase of 1.5% from 2017, which included an operational increase of 1.1% and a positive currency impact of 0.4%. U.S. sales were $12.8 billion, an increase of 0.1% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $14.2 billion, an increase of 2.8% as compared to the prior year, with an operational increase of 1.9% and a positive currency impact of 0.9%. In 2018, acquisitions and divestitures had a net negative impact of 1.5% on the worldwide operational sales growth of the Medical Devices segment as compared to 2017.

Growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by endocutter, biosurgery and energy products. Growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by wound care products. Growth in Specialty Surgery was primarily driven by Advanced Sterilization Products.The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $8.9 billion in 2018, a decrease of 1.9% from 2017. The decline in Spine & Other was primarily due to the Codman Neurosurgery divestiture and share loss in Spine partially offset by new product launches. The decline in knees was primarily due to competitive pressure in the U.S. partially offset by growth in Asia Pacific. Growth in hips and trauma was due to continued uptake of new products. The Vision franchise achieved sales of $4.6 billion in 2018, an increase of 12.1% from 2017. Growth was primarily driven by strength of the astigmatism and daily disposable lenses in the OASYS® contact lenses category. Surgical growth was driven by cataract performance primarily outside the U.S. The Interventional Solutions franchise (includes the Cerenovus business previously included in Spine and Other in Orthopaedics) sales were $2.6 billion, an increase of 15.2% from 2017. Strong growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by Atrial Fibrillation procedure growth and continued uptake of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH® Contact Force Sensing Catheter. The Diabetes Care franchise sales were $1.0 billion, a decrease of 37.5% from 2017. The decline was primarily due to divestiture of its LifeScan business in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018 and the Company's decision to exit the Animas insulin pump business in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2017. The Medical Devices segment sales in 2017 were $26.6 billion, an increase of 5.9% from 2016, which included an operational increase of 5.7% and a positive currency impact of 0.2%. U.S. sales were $12.8 billion, an increase of 4.5% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $13.8 billion, an increase of 7.1% as compared to the prior year, with an 22 operational increase of 6.7% and a positive currency impact of 0.4%. In 2017, acquisitions and divestitures had a net positive impact of 4.2% on the worldwide operational sales growth of the Medical Devices segment as compared to 2016. Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on IncomeConsolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was $18.0 billion, $17.7 billion and $19.8 billion for the fiscal years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was 22.1%, 23.1%, and 27.5% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses: Cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percent to sales were as follows:*% of Sales 2018 2017 2016Cost of products sold* 33.2% 33.3 30.3Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year (0.1) 3.0 (0.3)Selling, marketing and administrative expenses* 27.6% 28.1 27.9Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year (0.5) 0.2 (2.2)*Prior years amounts were reclassified to conform to current year presentation (adoption of ASU 2017-07)In 2018, cost of products sold as a percent to sales decreased to 33.2% from 33.3% as compared to the same period a year ago primarily due to lower inventory step-up costs related to the Actelion acquisition and favorable product and segment mix driven by a higher percentage of sales from the Pharmaceutical segment. This was mostly offset by higher amortization expense primarily related to the Actelion acquisition on June 16, 2017. Intangible asset amortization expense of $4.4 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2018 as compared to $3.0 billion in 2017. There was a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2018 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower costs relative to sales growth in the Pharmaceutical business and favorable segment mix.In 2017, cost of products sold as a percent to sales increased to 33.3% from 30.3% as compared to the same period a year ago. The unfavorable increase was primarily driven by $2.3 billion of higher amortization expense and charges for inventory step-up related to the recent acquisitions, primarily Actelion. Intangible asset amortization expense of $3.0 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2017 as compared to $1.2 billion in 2016. There was an increase in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2017 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to investments in new product launches partially offset by favorable mix. 23 Research and Development Expense: Research and development expense by segment of business was as follows:* 2018 2017 2016(Dollars in Millions) Amount % of Sales** Amount % of Sales** Amount % of Sales**Consumer $565 4.1% 586 4.3 585 4.4Pharmaceutical 8,446 20.7 8,392 23.1 7,001 20.9Medical Devices 1,764 6.5 1,616 6.1 1,557 6.2Total research and development expense $10,775 13.2% 10,594 13.9 9,143 12.7Percent increase/(decrease) over the prior year 1.7% 15.9 1.6 *Prior years amounts were reclassified to conform to current year presentation (adoption of ASU 2017-07)**As a percent to segment salesResearch and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. In 2018, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 1.7% compared to 2017 but decreased as a percent of sales. The decrease as a percent of sales in the Pharmaceutical segment was attributable to lower costs relative to sales growth. The increased dollar spend in the Medical Devices and Pharmaceutical segments was for investment spending to advance the pipeline. In 2017, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 15.9% compared to 2016. The increase as a percent of sales was primarily in the Pharmaceutical segment due to general portfolio progression as well as collaborative agreements entered into with Idorsia Ltd. and Legend Biotech. Research facilities are located in the U.S., Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom with additional R&D support in over 30 other countries.In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In 2018, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $1.1 billion. Of the $1.1 billion, a partial impairment charge of $0.8 billion related to the development program of AL-8176, an investigational drug for the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) acquired with the 2014 acquisition of Alios Biopharma Inc. The impairment charge was calculated based on updated cash flow projections discounted for the inherent risk in the asset development and reflects the impact of the phase 2b clinical trial suspension, a decrease in the probability of success factors and the ongoing analysis of asset development activities. The Company continues to evaluate information with respect to the development program and will monitor the remaining $0.9 billion intangible asset for further impairment. In addition, an impairment charge of $0.3 billion was recorded for the discontinuation of the development project for an anti-thrombin antibody associated with the 2015 acquisition of XO1 Limited. In 2017, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.4 billion primarily for the discontinuation of certain development projects related to Novira which was acquired in 2015. The product development was canceled due to safety concerns. In 2016, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $29 million for the discontinuation of a development program related to Crucell. Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), unrealized gains and losses on investments, gains and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2018 was an unfavorable change of $1.4 billion primarily due to litigation expense of $2.0 billion in 2018 as compared to $1.3 billion in 2017. Additionally, 2018 included unrealized losses on securities of $0.2 billion and lower realized gains of $0.4 billion related to investments in equity securities as compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by a reversal of a contingent liability of $0.2 billion and lower costs of $0.1 billion related to the Actelion and AMO acquisitions in 2018 as compared to 2017. The fiscal year of 2017 included a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables offset by an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin pump business. Divestiture gains were approximately $1.2 billion in 2018 and included the LifeScan business, NIZORAL®, RoC® and certain non-strategic Pharmaceutical products. Divestiture gains were approximately $1.3 billion in 2017 and primarily included the Codman Neurosurgery and COMPEED® divestitures. Additionally, restructuring related expense in 2018 was $0.3 billion as compared to $0.4 billion 2017.The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2017 was a favorable change of $0.3 billion due to higher gains of $0.7 billion on the sale of assets/businesses, primarily the Codman Neurosurgery and COMPEED® divestitures, a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables and a higher gain of $0.3 billion related to the sale of certain investments in equity securities as compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by higher litigation expense of $0.4 billion, $0.3 billion of acquisition costs related to Actelion and AMO, an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily 24 related to the insulin pump business and a higher restructuring related charge of $0.2 billion as compared to the fiscal year 2016. Interest (Income) Expense: Interest income was higher in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to a higher average interest rate and a benefit from net investment hedging partially offset by a lower average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance during the period. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $19.7 billion at the end of 2018, and averaged $19.0 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $18.3 billion and $30.1 billion average cash balance in 2017. The decrease in the average balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was due to the use of cash for general corporate purposes, primarily the Actelion acquisition for $29.6 billion, net of cash acquired late in the fiscal second quarter of 2017.Interest expense in 2018 was higher as compared to 2017 due to a higher average debt balance. The average debt balance was $32.5 billion in 2018 versus $30.9 billion in 2017. The total debt balance at the end of 2018 was $30.5 billion as compared to $34.6 billion at the end of 2017. Interest income in 2017 increased slightly as compared to 2016 due to higher average interest rates partially offset by lower cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during the period. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $18.3 billion at the end of 2017, and averaged $30.1 billion as compared to the $40.1 billion average cash balance in 2016. The decrease in the balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was due to the use of cash for general corporate purposes including acquisitions, primarily the Actelion acquisition for $29.6 billion, net of cash acquired.Interest expense in 2017 was higher as compared to 2016. The average debt balance was $30.9 billion in 2017 versus $23.5 billion in 2016. The total debt balance at the end of 2017 was $34.6 billion as compared to $27.1 billion at the end of 2016. The higher debt balance of approximately $7.5 billion was primarily due to increased borrowings. The Company increased borrowings in February and November of 2017, capitalizing on favorable terms in the capital markets. The proceeds of the borrowings were used for general corporate purposes, including the completion of the stock repurchase program.Income Before Tax by SegmentIncome before tax by segment of business were as follows: Income Before Tax Segment Sales Percent of Segment Sales(Dollars in Millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017Consumer $2,320 2,524 13,853 13,602 16.7% 18.6Pharmaceutical 12,568 11,083 40,734 36,256 30.9 30.6Medical Devices 4,397 5,392 26,994 26,592 16.3 20.3Total (1) 19,285 18,999 81,581 76,450 23.6 24.9Less: Expenses not allocated to segments (2) 1,286 1,326 Earnings before provision for taxes on income $17,999 17,673 81,581 76,450 22.1% 23.1(1) See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.(2) Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense and general corporate (income) expense. Consumer Segment: In 2018, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 16.7%, versus 18.6% in 2017. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to higher litigation expense of $0.3 billion in 2018 partially offset by slower increases in expenses relative to the increase in sales. Divestiture gains for the fiscal year of 2018, which included the divestitures of NIZORAL® and RoC® were comparable to fiscal year of 2017. A gain of $0.3 billion was recognized from the divestiture of NIZORAL®. In 2017, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 18.6%, versus 18.3% in 2016. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales in 2017 as compared to 2016 was attributable to higher gains on divestitures, primarily the divestiture of COMPEED® in 2017. This was partially offset by higher selling, marketing and administrative expenses as compared to the prior year due to increased advertising and promotional spending and slightly higher amortization expense in 2017 related to acquisitions. Additionally, the fiscal year 2016 was negatively impacted by operations in Venezuela. Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2018, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 30.9% versus 30.6% in 2017. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily due to lower inventory step-up costs related to Actelion of $0.6 billion, favorable product mix and slower increases in expenses relative to the increase in sales, a contingent liability reversal of $0.2 billion and higher divestiture gains of $0.2 billion from divestitures of certain non-strategic Pharmaceutical products. This was partially offset by higher amortization expense of $1.3 billion primarily related to the Actelion acquisition, a higher IPR&D charge of $0.7 billion and an unrealized loss on securities of $0.2 billion as compared to 25 the prior year. Additionally, 2017 included a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables and a higher gain of $0.3 billion related to the sale of certain investments in equity securities. In 2017, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 30.6% versus 38.3% in 2016. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily due to $2.3 billion of higher amortization expense and other costs related to the Actelion acquisition, higher research and development expense, a higher IPR&D charge of $0.4 billion related to Novira and lower gains on divestitures as compared to the prior year. Additionally, the fiscal year 2016 included a positive adjustment of $0.5 billion to previous reserve estimates. This was partially offset by a gain of $0.2 billion related to monetization of future royalty receivables, a higher gain of $0.2 billion related to the sale of certain investments in equity securities and favorable product mix in 2017. Medical Devices Segment: In 2018, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 16.3% versus 20.3% in 2017. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily due higher litigation expense of $1.7 billion in 2018 as compared to $1.1 billion in 2017 and higher investments in the business in 2018. Additionally, 2018 had lower divestiture gains of approximately $0.3 billion as compared to divestiture gains in 2017. In 2018 the Company recorded a gain of $0.5 billion related to the LifeScan divestiture. This was partially offset by lower restructuring expense of $0.2 billion in 2018 as compared to 2017. Additionally, 2017 included an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin pump business. In 2017, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 20.3% versus 22.2% in 2016. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily due to $0.3 billion of higher amortization expense and other acquisition costs related to AMO, $0.3 billion of higher litigation, an asset impairment charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to the insulin pump business, $0.1 billion of higher restructuring and investments in new product launches as compared to the fiscal year 2016. This was partially offset by $0.8 billion higher gains in 2017 related to divestitures, primarily the divestiture of Codman Neurosurgery.Restructuring: In the first quarter of 2016, the Company announced restructuring actions in its Medical Devices segment. The Company has achieved approximately $0.7 billion of annualized pre-tax cost saving in 2018 and is on track to achieve the annualized pre-tax cost savings of $0.8 billion to $1.0 billion as outlined in the restructuring actions. The savings will provide the Company with added flexibility and resources to fund investment in new growth opportunities and innovative solutions for customers and patients. In 2018, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $462 million, of which $46 million is included in cost of products sold and $227 million is included in other (income) expense. Total project costs of approximately $2.5 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. This restructuring program was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its global supply chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its network. Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 to $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. In 2018, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $238 million, of which $59 million is included in cost of products sold and $117 million is included in other (income) expense. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 15.0% in 2018, 92.6% in 2017 and 16.5% in 2016. The 2018 effective tax rate decreased by 77.6% as compared to 2017. The 2017 effective tax rate was primarily driven by a provisional tax charge of approximately $13.0 billion as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the impact of a Belgian statutory tax rate change which increased the 2017 effective rate by 3.4%. The Company also received a benefit in 2018 from a lower U.S. statutory tax rate vs. 2017 as well as favorable adjustments to the 2017 provisional TCJA tax charge partially offset by unfavorable income tax mix and the U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). The 2017 effective tax rate increased by 76.1% as compared to 2016, primarily driven by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in the United States in December 2017. The enactment of the TCJA resulted in a provisional tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017, of approximately $13.0 billion or approximately 73.3 percentage point increase to the effective tax rate. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the TCJA. 26 The remainder of the increase in the tax rate for 2017 was related to the remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets in Belgium, as a result of changes in the Belgian statutory corporate tax rate, enacted in December 2017, offset by a tax benefit for the closure of the Company’s Animas insulin pump business. The government in Switzerland is currently considering tax reform legislation, which could have a material impact on the Company’s effective tax rate if enacted into law.See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the TCJA and income taxes.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesLiquidity & Cash FlowsCash and cash equivalents were $18.1 billion at the end of 2018 as compared to $17.8 billion at the end of 2017. The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $0.3 billion increase were approximately $22.2 billion of cash generated from operating activities. This was partially offset by $3.2 billion net cash used by investing activities, $18.5 billion net cash used by financing activities and $0.2 billion due to the effect on exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the Company had $1.6 billion in marketable securities at the end of 2018 and $0.5 billion at the end of 2017. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.Cash flow from operations of $22.2 billion was the result of $15.3 billion of net earnings and $9.2 billion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and assets write-downs, offset by $2.3 billion from net gains on sale of assets/businesses, deferred tax provision and accounts receivable allowances, $3.9 billion related to an increase in accounts receivable, inventories and other current and non-current assets and a decrease in other current and non-current liabilities. Additional sources of operating cash flow of $4.0 billion resulted from an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The decrease in current and non-current liabilities is primarily due to the 2018 tax payment related to TCJA. Investing activities use of $3.2 billion was for additions to property, plant and equipment of $3.7 billion, the net purchase of investments primarily marketable securities of $1.3 billion, acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $0.9 billion (primarily the acquisitions of Zarbee's) and other uses of $0.5 billion. This was partially offset by $3.2 billion of proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses (primarily the divestiture of LifeScan). Financing activities use of $18.5 billion was primarily for dividends to shareholders of $9.5 billion, $5.9 billion for the repurchase of common stock, $3.9 billion for the net retirement of short and long-term debt and $0.2 billion of other financing. Financing activities also included sources of $1.0 billion of proceeds from stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, net.On December 17, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. Any shares acquired will be available for general corporate purposes. The Company intends to finance the share repurchase program through available cash. As of December 30, 2018, $0.9 billion has been repurchased under the program.As of December 30, 2018, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of December 30, 2018, the net debt position was $10.8 billion as compared to the prior year of $16.3 billion. There was a decrease in the net debt position due to retirement of debt. The debt balance at the end of 2018 was $30.5 billion as compared to $34.6 billion in 2017. Additionally there was a higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance at the end of 2018. In 2018, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Additionally, as a result of the TCJA, the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs for the next twelve months. The Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. The Company filed a new shelf registration on February 27, 2017 which will enable it to issue debt securities on a timely basis. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Financing and Market RiskThe Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 30, 2018 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $57 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 30, 2018 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $69 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows. 27 The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $226 million. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counter-parties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. During the fiscal second quarter of 2017, the Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements.The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $8 million. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2018, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 12, 2019. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.Total borrowings at the end of 2018 and 2017 were $30.5 billion and $34.6 billion, respectively. The decrease in borrowings was due to the retirement of debt in 2018. In 2018, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $10.8 billion compared to net debt of $16.3 billion in 2017. Total debt represented 33.8% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2018 and 36.5% of total capital in 2017. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2018 was $22.44 compared to $22.43 at year-end 2017.A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsThe Company’s contractual obligations are primarily for the recently enacted tax legislation, leases, debt and unfunded retirement plans. There are no other significant obligations. To satisfy these obligations, the Company will use cash from operations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of December 30, 2018 (see Notes 7, 8, 10 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details):(Dollars in Millions) Tax Legislation (TCJA) Debt Obligations Interest onDebt Obligations UnfundedRetirement Plans Operating Leases Total2019 $— 2,636 949 92 223 3,9002020 531 1,098 886 95 188 2,7982021 812 1,796 841 101 154 3,7042022 812 2,134 796 108 116 3,9662023 1,522 1,553 764 115 76 4,030After 2023 4,565 21,103 8,850 697 139 35,354Total $8,242 30,320 13,086 1,208 896 53,752For tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

DividendsThe Company increased its dividend in 2018 for the 56th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $3.54 per share in 2018 compared with dividends of $3.32 per share in 2017, and $3.15 per share in 2016. 28 Other InformationCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Accounting Standards Update related to revenue which was adopted in 2018.Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2018, 2017 and 2016.Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact. 29 Below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.Consumer Segment(Dollars in Millions) Balance atBeginning of Period Accruals Payments/Credits Balance atEnd of Period2018 Accrued rebates (1) $186 836 (751) 271Accrued returns 68 98 (109) 57Accrued promotions 481 2,233 (2,217) 497Subtotal $735 3,167 (3,077) 825Reserve for doubtful accounts 31 10 (9) 32Reserve for cash discounts 23 204 (204) 23Total $789 3,381 (3,290) 880 2017 Accrued rebates(1) $136 638 (588) 186Accrued returns 65 128 (125) 68Accrued promotions 358 2,148 (2,025) 481Subtotal $559 2,914 (2,738) 735Reserve for doubtful accounts 24 10 (3) 31Reserve for cash discounts 25 205 (207) 23Total $608 3,129 (2,948) 789(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $57 million at December 30, 2018 and $48 million at December 31, 2017, recorded as a contra asset.Pharmaceutical Segment(Dollars in Millions) Balance atBeginning of Period Accruals Payments/Credits(2) Balance atEnd of Period2018 Accrued rebates (1) $4,862 22,644 (19,996) 7,510Accrued returns 362 385 (311) 436Accrued promotions 35 46 (68) 13Subtotal $5,259 23,075 (20,375) 7,959Reserve for doubtful accounts 77 37 (67) 47Reserve for cash discounts 55 860 (862) 53Total $5,391 23,972 (21,304) 8,059 2017 Accrued rebates (1) $3,420 16,447 (15,005) 4,862Accrued returns 334 256 (228) 362Accrued promotions — 69 (34) 35Subtotal $3,754 16,772 (15,267) 5,259Reserve for doubtful accounts 38 40 (1) 77Reserve for cash discounts 58 714 (717) 55Total $3,850 17,526 (15,985) 5,391(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $89 million at December 30, 2018 and $90 million at December 31, 2017, recorded as a contra asset.

The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.7 billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued.See Notes 1 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings. 31 Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates and the effect a rate change to the health care cost trend would have on the Company’s results of operations.Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units the fair market value is calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant. The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 30, 2018.Economic and Market FactorsThe Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2008 - 2018, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for health care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.In June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to as “Brexit” and in March 2017 the U.K. formally started the process for the U.K. to leave the E.U. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have. Brexit creates global political and economic uncertainty, which may cause, among other consequences, volatility in exchange rates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in regulations. However, the Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or operating results. As of December 30, 2018, the business of the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries represented less than 3% of both the Company’s consolidated assets and fiscal twelve months revenues, respectively.The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2018 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $390 million and net income by approximately $100 million.Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. On September 28, 2018 the Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (Swiss Tax Reform). However, a referendum has been called and, as a result, a public vote on the Swiss Tax Reform 32 will take place on May 19th, 2019. If the Swiss Tax Reform passes, then the measures are expected to come into force in either January 2020 or January 2021. Prior to approval in the referendum and its subsequent cantonal implementation, the proposed Swiss Tax Reform is not enacted and therefore the Company has not reflected any of the potential impacts in its fiscal results. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the proposed Swiss Tax Reform, and when enacted, the law may have a material impact on the Company’s operating results. The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. For further information, see the discussion on “REMICADE® Related Cases” and “Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications” in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Legal ProceedingsJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for certain litigation matters and continues to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals for new information and further developments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters currently disclosed for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; or there are numerous parties involved.In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.Common Stock The Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 15, 2019, there were 142,029 record holders of Common Stock of the Company.

The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold both to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and eye health fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments.In all of its product lines, the Company competes with other companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.Management’s Objectives With “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity.

The Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2019 sales. In 2019, $11.4 billion was invested in research and development and $5.8 billion spent on acquisitions, reflecting management’s commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. A critical driver of the Company’s success is the 132,200 diverse employees worldwide. Employees are empowered and inspired to lead with the Company’s Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to use the Company’s reach and size to advance the Company's purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise, enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence. This ensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. 17 Results of OperationsAnalysis of Consolidated SalesFor discussion on results of operations and financial condition pertaining to the fiscal years 2018 and 2017 see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018, Item 7.

Growth was primarily driven by incremental sales from the acquisition of Ci:z Holdings Co., Ltd., (DR.CI:LABO) in Japan as well as market growth and share gains of NEUTROGENA® and AVEENO® products. Growth was partially offset by the divestitures of RoC® and NIZORAL® in the fiscal year 2018. The Over-the-Counter (OTC) franchise sales of $4.4 billion increased 2.5% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by incremental sales from the acquisition of ZARBEES®. Additional contributors to the growth were TYLENOL®, Children's MOTRIN®, digestive health products and anti-smoking aids. The Baby Care franchise sales were $1.7 billion in 2019, a decrease of 9.9% compared to the prior year, primarily due to JOHNSON’s® competitive pressures coupled with comparisons to prior year relaunch activities and the Baby Center divestiture.The Oral Care franchise sales of $1.5 billion decreased 1.7% as compared to the prior year. Growth in LISTERINE® Mouthwash and Ready Tabs outside the U.S. was offset by share declines and retailer destocking in the U.S. and the negative impact of currency.The Women’s Health franchise sales were $1.0 billion in 2019, a decrease of 6.0% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by the negative impact of currency and weakness in liners partially offset by strength in napkins in Asia Pacific and Latin America. The Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $0.7 billion in 2019, a decrease of 0.6% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by the divestiture of COMPEED® outside the U.S. and the negative impact of currency. 19 Pharmaceutical SegmentPharmaceutical segment sales in 2019 were $42.2 billion, an increase of 3.6% from 2018, which included operational growth of 5.8% and a negative currency impact of 2.2%. U.S. sales were $23.9 billion, an increase of 2.5%. International sales were $18.3 billion, an increase of 5.0%, which included 10.1% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 5.1%. In 2019, the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the Pharmaceutical segment operational sales growth was negligible. Adjustments to previous reserve estimates, as compared to the prior year, positively impacted the Pharmaceutical segment operational growth by approximately 1.3%, primarily in the Immunology and Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other therapeutic areas.Major Pharmaceutical Therapeutic Area Sales: % Change(Dollars in Millions) 2019 2018 ’19 vs. ’18Total Immunology $13,950 13,120 6.3 % REMICADE® 4,380 5,326 (17.8) SIMPONI®/SIMPONI ARIA® 2,188 2,084 5.0 STELARA® 6,361 5,156 23.4 TREMFYA® 1,012 544 85.9 Other Immunology 10 10 4.5Total Infectious Diseases 3,413 3,304 3.3 EDURANT®/rilpivirine 861 816 5.6 PREZISTA®/ PREZCOBIX®/REZOLSTA®/SYMTUZA® 2,110 1,955 8.0 Other Infectious Diseases 441 533 (17.3)Total Neuroscience 6,328 6,077 4.1 CONCERTA®/methylphenidate 696 663 4.9 INVEGA SUSTENNA®/XEPLION®/INVEGA TRINZA®/TREVICTA® 3,330 2,928 13.7 RISPERDAL CONSTA® 688 737 (6.7) Other Neuroscience 1,614 1,749 (7.7)Total Oncology 10,692 9,844 8.6 DARZALEX® 2,998 2,025 48.0 IMBRUVICA® 3,411 2,615 30.4 VELCADE® 751 1,116 (32.7) ZYTIGA® /abiraterone acetate 2,795 3,498 (20.1) Other Oncology 739 590 25.0Total Pulmonary Hypertension 2,623 2,573 1.9 OPSUMIT® 1,327 1,215 9.2 TRACLEER® /bosentan 341 546 (37.5) UPTRAVI® 819 663 23.5 Other Pulmonary Hypertension 135 149 (9.4)Total Cardiovascular / Metabolism / Other 5,192 5,816 (10.7) XARELTO® 2,313 2,477 (6.6) INVOKANA®/ INVOKAMET® 735 881 (16.5) PROCRIT®/EPREX® 790 988 (20.0) Other 1,353 1,470 (8.0)Total Pharmaceutical Sales $42,198 40,734 3.6 % 20 Immunology products sales were $14.0 billion in 2019, representing an increase of 6.3% as compared to the prior year. Growth was driven by strong uptake of STELARA® (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease, and TREMFYA® (guselkumab) in Psoriasis, expanded indications of SIMPONI®/SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab), and the U.S. immunology market growth. Immunology was negatively impacted by lower sales of REMICADE® (infliximab) due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition. The patents for REMICADE® (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE® have been introduced in certain markets outside the U.S., resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE® in those markets. Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in REMICADE® sales in markets outside the United States. In the U.S., a biosimilar version of REMICADE® was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the U.S. market will result in a further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE®. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of legal matters regarding the REMICADE® patents. Infectious disease products sales were $3.4 billion in 2019, representing an increase of 3.3% as compared to the prior year. Strong sales of SYMTUZA® and the launch of JULUCA® (dolutegravir/rilpivirine) were partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA® and PREZCOBIX®/REZOLSTA® (darunavir/cobicistat) due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA® in certain countries outside the U.S. Neuroscience products sales were $6.3 billion, representing an increase of 4.1% as compared to the prior year. Strong sales of long-acting injectables INVEGA TRINZA®/TREVICTA®(paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA SUSTENNA®/XEPLION® were partially offset by cannibalization of RISPERDAL CONSTA® (risperidone). Oncology products achieved sales of $10.7 billion in 2019, representing an increase of 8.6% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX® (daratumumab) with continued market growth and share gain, IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) due to increased patient uptake globally. Additionally, sales from the launch of ERLEADA™ (apalutamide) contributed to the growth. Growth was negatively impacted from a decline in U.S. sales of ZYTIGA® (abiraterone acetate) driven by generic competition partially offset by increased sales outside the U.S. Lower sales of VELCADE® (bortezomib) were also due to generic competition. Pulmonary Hypertension products achieved sales of $2.6 billion, representing an increase of 1.9% as compared to the prior year. Sales of OPSUMIT® (macitentan) and UPTRAVI® (selexipag) were due to continued market growth and increased share gains while sales of TRACLEER® (bosentan) were negatively impacted by generics and cannibalization from OPSUMIT®. Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $5.2 billion, a decline of 10.7% as compared to the prior year. XARELTO® (rivaroxaban) sales volume growth was offset by higher discounts and rebates. Lower sales of INVOKANA®/INVOKAMET® (canagliflozin) were due to share loss from competitive pressure and a safety label update in the U.S. and lower sales of PROCRIT®/ EPREX® (epoetin alfa) were due to biosimilar competition. 21 During 2019, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows:Product Name (Chemical Name)IndicationUS ApprovalEU ApprovalUS FilingEU FilingBALVERSA™ (erdafitinib)Treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancerŸ DARZALEX® (daratumumab)Combination Regimen for Newly Diagnosed, Transplant-eligible Patients with Multiple MyelomaŸ Ÿ Newly diagnosed patients with Multiple Myeloma in combination with Lenalidomide and DexamethasoneŸ Split-dosing regimenŸ Combination therapy for transplant ineligible Multiple Myeloma patients ŸŸ Subcutaneous Formulation in Multiple Myeloma ŸŸ ERLEADA™ (apalutamide)Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Ÿ Treatment of Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer ŸIMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib)Expanded Use in Combination with Obinutuzumab in Adult Patients with Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and in Combination with Rituximab in Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia Ÿ Treatment for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in combination with obinutuzumabŸ INVOKANA® (canagliflozin)Treatment of Diabetic Kidney DiseaseŸ rilpivirine and cabotegravirFor Monthly, Injectable, Two Drug Regimen for Treatment of HIV ŸŸSPRAVATO® (esketamine)Treatment-resistant depressionŸŸ Rapid Reduction of Depressive Symptoms in Adults with Major Depressive Disorder who have Active Suicidal Ideation with Intent Ÿ STELARA® (ustekinumab)Extended Use for the Treatment of Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative ColitisŸŸ Treatment of Pediatric Patients with Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis Ÿ TREMFYA® (guselkumab)One-press patient-controlled injectorŸ Treatment of Adults with Active Psoriatic Arthritis ŸŸXARELTO® (rivaroxaban)For the prevention of Blood Clots in Acutely Ill Medical PatientsŸ 22 Medical Devices SegmentThe Medical Devices segment sales in 2019 were $26.0 billion, a decrease of 3.8% from 2018, which included an operational decrease of 1.7% and a negative currency impact of 2.1%.

Growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by endocutter, biosurgery and energy products. The decline in General Surgery was primarily driven by the negative impact of currency partially offset by growth of wound closure products. The decline in Specialty Surgery was primarily driven by the divestiture of the sterilization business (ASP) partially offset by growth of aesthetic products.The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $8.8 billion in 2019, a decrease of 0.5%, including operational growth of 1.2% offset by a negative currency impact of 1.7% as compared to the prior year. The growth in hips was driven by leadership position in the anterior approach, strong market demand for the ACTIS® stem and the KINCISE™ surgical automated system. Knees grew outside the U.S. from new products coupled with continued global uptake of ATTUNE® Revision, offset by a negative currency impact. Growth in trauma was due to strong market growth coupled with continued uptake of new products. The decline in Spine & Other was primarily driven by base business declines in Spine partially offset by growth in Sports which was led by new products, MONOVISC® in the U.S. and growth in Asia Pacific. The Vision franchise achieved sales of $4.6 billion in 2019, an increase of 1.6% from 2018. Growth was primarily driven by the strength of daily disposable lenses in the ACUVUE® OASYS contact lenses category. The Surgical operational growth was primarily driven by the strength of cataracts outside the U.S. partially offset by competitive pressures in the U.S.The Interventional Solutions franchise achieved sales of $3.0 billion in 2019, an increase of 13.3% from 2018. Strong growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by Atrial Fibrillation procedure growth and with strong THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH® SF Contact Force Sensing Catheter and diagnostic catheter sales. 23 Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on IncomeConsolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was $17.3 billion and $18.0 billion for the fiscal years ended 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was 21.1% and 22.1%, in 2019 and 2018, respectively.Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses: Cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percent to sales were as follows:% of Sales 2019 2018Cost of products sold 33.6% 33.2Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year 0.4 (0.1)Selling, marketing and administrative expenses 27.0% 27.6Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year (0.6) (0.5)In 2019, cost of products sold as a percent to sales increased to 33.6% from 33.2% as compared to the same period a year ago primarily driven by the negative impact of currency in the Pharmaceutical business as well as increased intangible asset amortization expense. Intangible asset amortization expense of $4.5 billion was included in cost of products sold for 2019 as compared to $4.4 billion in 2018. There was a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2019 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to favorable segment mix with a higher percentage of sales coming from the Pharmaceutical business, planned prioritization and reduced brand marketing expense in the Consumer business partially offset by increased selling and marketing investments in the Medical Devices business. Research and Development Expense: Research and development expense by segment of business was as follows: 2019 2018(Dollars in Millions) Amount % of Sales* Amount % of Sales*Consumer $493 3.5% 565 4.1Pharmaceutical 8,834 20.9 8,446 20.7Medical Devices 2,028 7.8 1,764 6.5Total research and development expense $11,355 13.8% 10,775 13.2Percent increase/(decrease) over the prior year 5.4% 1.7 *As a percent to segment sales 24 Research and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and developmental milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. In 2019, worldwide costs of research and development activities increased by 5.4% compared to 2018 primarily driven by increased investment in the Medical Devices business related to robotics and digital surgery platforms along with higher upfront and developmental milestone payments, primarily from the argenx collaboration in the Pharmaceutical business. Research facilities are located in the U.S., Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom with additional R&D support in over 30 other countries.In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In the fiscal first quarter of 2019, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion for the remaining intangible asset value related to the development program of AL-8176, an investigational drug for the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) acquired with the 2014 acquisition of Alios Biopharma Inc. The impairment charge was based on additional information, including clinical data, which became available and led to the Company's decision to abandon the development of AL-8176. In the fiscal third quarter of 2018, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 billion which included a partial impairment charge of $0.8 billion related to the development program of AL-8176 and an impairment charge of $0.3 billion for the discontinuation of the development project for an anti-thrombin antibody associated with the 2015 acquisition of XO1 Limited. Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), unrealized gains and losses on investments, gains and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. The change in other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2019 was additional net expense of $1.1 billion primarily attributable to litigation expense of $5.1 billion in 2019, primarily related to the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation of $4.0 billion, as compared to litigation expense of $2.0 billion in 2018. This was partially offset by divestiture gains in 2019 of $2.2 billion of which $2.0 billion related to the divestiture of the ASP business. In addition, the fiscal year 2019 included higher unrealized gains on securities of $0.7 billion, an equity step-up gain of $0.3 billion related to the Company's previously held equity investment in DR. CI:LABO, and lower restructuring related expense of $0.2 billion as compared to the same period a year ago. Divestiture gains were approximately $1.2 billion in 2018 and included the LifeScan business, NIZORAL®, RoC® and certain non-strategic Pharmaceutical products. Additionally, 2018 included a reversal of a contingent liability of $0.2 billion. Interest (Income) Expense: The fiscal year 2019 included net interest income as compared to an expense in the fiscal year 2018. This was primarily due to the positive effect of net investment hedging arrangements and certain cross currency swaps, and a lower average debt balance. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $19.3 billion at the end of 2019, and averaged $19.5 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $19.7 billion and $19.0 billion average cash balance in 2018. The total debt balance at the end of 2019 was $27.7 billion with an average debt balance of $29.1 billion as compared to $30.5 billion at the end of 2018 and an average debt balance of $32.5 billion. The decrease in debt was due to the retirement of long-term debt. Income Before Tax by SegmentIncome before tax by segment of business were as follows: Income Before Tax Segment Sales Percent of Segment Sales(Dollars in Millions) 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018Consumer $2,061 2,320 13,898 13,853 14.8% 16.7Pharmaceutical 8,816 12,568 42,198 40,734 20.9 30.9Medical Devices 7,286 4,397 25,963 26,994 28.1 16.3Total (1) 18,163 19,285 82,059 81,581 22.1 23.6Less: Net expense not allocated to segments (2) 835 1,286 Earnings before provision for taxes on income $17,328 17,999 82,059 81,581 21.1% 22.1(1) See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.(2) Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense and general corporate (income) expense. 25 Consumer Segment: In 2019, the Consumer segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 14.8%, versus 16.7% in 2018. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to higher expenses for litigation of $0.1 billion, intangible asset amortization of $0.1 billion and restructuring of $0.1 billion in the fiscal year 2019 as compared to the fiscal year 2018. This was partially offset by planned prioritization and brand marketing expense reductions. The fiscal year 2019 included a gain of $0.3 billion related to the Company's previously held equity investment in DR. CI:LABO. Divestiture gains for the fiscal year of 2018 included a gain of $0.3 billion from the divestiture of NIZORAL®. Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2019, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 20.9% versus 30.9% in 2018. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily due to higher litigation expense of $4.3 billion, primarily due to the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation of $4.0 billion, increased spending in research and development, including a $0.3 billion upfront payment to argenx. This was partially offset by $0.8 billion of higher unrealized gains on securities, a lower in-process research and development charge of $0.2 billion, and lower Actelion acquisition and integration related costs as compared to the fiscal year 2018. In addition, the fiscal year 2018 included a contingent liability reversal of $0.2 billion and higher divestiture gains of $0.2 billion.Medical Devices Segment: In 2019, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 28.1% versus 16.3% in 2018. The increase in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily attributable to higher divestiture gains in 2019. Divestiture gains in the fiscal 2019 included a gain of $2.0 billion related to the ASP business. Divestiture gains for the fiscal year of 2018 included a gain of $0.5 billion related to LifeScan. Additionally, the fiscal year 2019 included lower litigation expense of $1.3 billion, lower restructuring charges of $0.2 billion and lower intangible asset amortization expense of $0.1 billion as compared to the fiscal year 2018. This was partially offset by increased investment in robotics and digital solutions. Restructuring: In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its global supply chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its network. Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 to $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. In 2019, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.6 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.3 billion in restructuring, $0.2 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $0.8 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced.See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 12.7% in 2019 and 15.0% in 2018. For discussion related to the fiscal 2019 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On September 28, 2018 the Swiss Parliament approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF). On May 19, 2019 a public referendum was held in Switzerland that approved the federal reform proposals. In the fiscal third quarter of 2019, the Swiss Federal Council enacted TRAF which became effective on January 1, 2020. On February 9, 2020 a public referendum on the legislative change was held in the last remaining canton where the Company has significant operations. The legislation was approved by the voters and formal enactment is expected in the fiscal first half of 2020. The Company has not yet elected the transitional provision in this canton. However, the net financial benefit is estimated to be between $0.2 billion and $0.5 billion in the fiscal first half of 2020. The Company does not believe that TRAF will have a material impact to the Company’s ongoing consolidated effective tax rate beginning in fiscal year 2020. 26 Liquidity and Capital ResourcesLiquidity & Cash FlowsCash and cash equivalents were $17.3 billion at the end of 2019 as compared to $18.1 billion at the end of 2018. The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $0.8 billion decrease were approximately $23.4 billion of cash generated from operating activities. This was offset by $6.2 billion net cash used by investing activities and $18.0 billion net cash used by financing activities. In addition, the Company had $2.0 billion in marketable securities at the end of 2019 and $1.6 billion at the end of 2018. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.Cash flow from operations of $23.4 billion was the result of $15.1 billion of net earnings and $9.1 billion of non-cash expenses and other adjustments for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, assets write-downs (primarily related to the Alios IPR&D asset), and favorable increases in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other liabilities of $5.5 billion. This was reduced by $1.6 billion related to an increase in accounts receivable, inventories, other current and non-current assets. as well as non-cash expenses and other adjustments of $2.5 billion for the increase in the deferred tax provision and a net gain on sale of assets/businesses of $2.2 billion (primarily related to the ASP divestiture).Investing activities use of $6.2 billion of cash was primarily used for acquisitions of $5.8 billion primarily related to the acquisitions of Auris Health, Inc. and DR. CI:LABO, additions to property, plant and equipment of $3.5 billion and $0.5 billion from the net purchases of investments. Investing activities also included a source of $3.3 billion of proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses, primarily the ASP divestiture, and proceeds from credit support agreements of $0.3 billion. Financing activities use of $18.0 billion of cash was primarily used for dividends to shareholders of $9.9 billion, the repurchase of common stock of $6.7 billion and the net retirement of short and long term debt of $2.9 billion. Financing activities also included sources of $1.5 billion from proceeds of stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, and other financing activities.On December 17, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. Shares acquired are available for general corporate purposes. The Company financed the share repurchase program through available cash. As of September 29, 2019, $5.0 billion was repurchased under the program and the program was completed.As of December 29, 2019, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of December 29, 2019, the net debt position was $8.4 billion as compared to the prior year of $10.8 billion. There was a decrease in the net debt position due to retirement of debt. The debt balance at the end of 2019 was $27.7 billion as compared to $30.5 billion in 2018. In 2019, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Additionally, as a result of the TCJA, the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation to be potentially paid over the next two to three years. As discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its audit for the tax years through 2009 and is currently auditing the tax years 2010-2012. The Company currently expects completion of this audit and settlement of the related tax liabilities in the fiscal year 2020. As of December 29, 2019, the Company has classified unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of approximately $0.9 billion as a current liability in the “Accrued taxes on Income” line in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This is the amount expected to be paid over the next 12 months with respect to the IRS audit. Subsequent to December 29, 2019, the Company made a payment for approximately $0.6 billion to the U.S. Treasury related to the estimated 2010-2012 tax audit liability in anticipation of the final settlement later in fiscal 2020. The completion of this tax audit may result in additional adjustments to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefit liability that may have a material impact on the Company’s future operating results or cash flows in the period that the audit is substantially completed. The Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. The Company filed a shelf registration on February 27, 2017, which will enable it to issue debt securities on a timely basis and will be updated as required. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Financing and Market RiskThe Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 29, 2019 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $271 million. Conversely, a 27 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 29, 2019 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $331 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $1,043 million. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counter-parties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. During the fiscal second quarter of 2017, the Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on credit support agreements.The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $7 million. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2019, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 10, 2020. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), or other applicable market rate as allowed under the terms of the agreement, plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.Total borrowings at the end of 2019 and 2018 were $27.7 billion and $30.5 billion, respectively. The decrease in borrowings was due to the retirement of debt in 2019. In 2019, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $8.4 billion compared to net debt of $10.8 billion in 2018. Total debt represented 31.8% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2019 and 33.8% of total capital in 2018. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2019 was $22.59 compared to $22.44 at year-end 2018.A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsThe Company’s contractual obligations are primarily for the recently enacted tax legislation, leases, debt and unfunded retirement plans. There are no other significant obligations. To satisfy these obligations, the Company will use cash from operations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of December 29, 2019 (see Notes 7, 8, 10 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details):(Dollars in Millions) Tax Legislation (TCJA) Debt Obligations Interest onDebt Obligations UnfundedRetirement Plans Leases Total2020 $528 1,100 886 103 215 2,8322021 812 1,797 841 107 254 3,8112022 812 2,106 796 113 197 4,0242023 1,522 1,552 764 118 141 4,0972024 2,029 1,474 729 127 86 4,445After 2024 2,536 19,565 8,121 749 201 31,172Total $8,239 27,594 12,137 1,317 1,094 50,381For tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cash dividends paid were $3.75 per share in 2019 and $3.54 per share in 2018. Other InformationCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Accounting Standards Update related to revenue which was adopted in 2018.Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal reporting years 2019 and 2018.Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were approximately 2.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact. 29 Below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018.Consumer Segment(Dollars in Millions) Balance atBeginning of Period Accruals Payments/Credits Balance atEnd of Period2019 Accrued rebates (1) $271 841 (828) 284Accrued returns 57 128 (122) 63Accrued promotions 497 2,119 (2,129) 487Subtotal $825 3,088 (3,079) 834Reserve for doubtful accounts 32 21 (18) 35Reserve for cash discounts 23 198 (204) 17Total $880 3,307 (3,301) 886 2018 Accrued rebates(1) $186 836 (751) 271Accrued returns 68 98 (109) 57Accrued promotions 481 2,233 (2,217) 497Subtotal $735 3,167 (3,077) 825Reserve for doubtful accounts 31 10 (9) 32Reserve for cash discounts 23 204 (204) 23Total $789 3,381 (3,290) 880(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $54 million at December 29, 2019 and $57 million at December 30, 2018, recorded as a contra asset.Pharmaceutical Segment(Dollars in Millions) Balance atBeginning of Period Accruals Payments/Credits(2) Balance atEnd of Period2019 Accrued rebates (1) $7,510 26,868 (25,365) 9,013Accrued returns 436 354 (290) 500Accrued promotions 13 17 (25) 5Subtotal $7,959 27,239 (25,680) 9,518Reserve for doubtful accounts 47 2 (13) 36Reserve for cash discounts 53 936 (924) 65Total $8,059 28,177 (26,617) 9,619 2018 Accrued rebates (1) $4,862 22,644 (19,996) 7,510Accrued returns 362 385 (311) 436Accrued promotions 35 46 (68) 13Subtotal $5,259 23,075 (20,375) 7,959Reserve for doubtful accounts 77 37 (67) 47Reserve for cash discounts 55 860 (862) 53Total $5,391 23,972 (21,304) 8,059(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $93 million at December 29, 2019 and $89 million at December 30, 2018, recorded as a contra asset. 30 (2) Includes adjustmentsMedical Devices Segment(Dollars in Millions) Balance atBeginning of Period Accruals Payments/Credits Balance atEnd of Period2019 Accrued rebates(1) $1,218 5,487 (5,692) 1,013Accrued returns 114 673 (669) 118Accrued promotions 42 106 (102) 46Subtotal $1,374 6,266 (6,463) 1,177Reserve for doubtful accounts 169 30 (44) 155Reserve for cash discounts — 106 (96) 10Total $1,543 6,402 (6,603) 1,342 2018(2) Accrued rebates(1) $1,620 6,344 (6,746) 1,218Accrued returns 152 750 (788) 114Accrued promotions 83 116 (157) 42Subtotal $1,855 7,210 (7,691) 1,374Reserve for doubtful accounts 183 29 (43) 169Reserve for cash discounts 15 140 (155) —Total $2,053 7,379 (7,889) 1,543(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $499 million at December 29, 2019 and $632 million at December 30, 2018, recorded as a contra asset.(2) Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.Income Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.8 billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued. 31 See Notes 1 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings.Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates and the effect a rate change to the health care cost trend would have on the Company’s results of operations.Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units the fair market value is calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant. The fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 29, 2019.Economic and Market FactorsThe Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2009 - 2019, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for health care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.In June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to as “Brexit” and on January 31, 2020, the U.K. formally exited the E.U. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what the ultimate financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have. Brexit creates global political and economic uncertainty, which may cause, among other consequences, volatility in exchange rates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in regulations. However, the Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or operating results. As of December 29, 2019, the business of the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries represented less than 3% of both the Company’s consolidated assets and fiscal twelve months revenues, respectively.The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2019 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $390 million and net income by approximately $120 million.Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate 32 may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. For discussion on Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (Swiss Tax Reform) see Provision for Taxes on Income in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. For further information, see the discussion on “REMICADE® Related Cases” and “Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications” in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Legal ProceedingsJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 29, 2019, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.Common Stock The Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ.

200406,JNJ,JOHNSON & JOHNSON,2021,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition of this Report. The Company's subsidiaries generally seek to own, rather than lease, their manufacturing facilities, although some, principally in non-U.S. locations, are leased. Office and warehouse facilities are often leased. The Company also engages contract manufacturers. The Company is committed to maintaining all of its properties in good operating condition. McNEIL-PPC, Inc. (now Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (McNEIL-PPC) continues to operate under a consent decree, signed in 2011 with the FDA, which governs certain McNeil Consumer Healthcare manufacturing operations, and requires McNEIL-PPC to remediate the facilities it operates in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, and Las Piedras, Puerto Rico (the ""Consent Decree""). Following FDA inspections McNEIL-PPC received notifications from the FDA that all three manufacturing facilities are in conformity with applicable laws and regulations, and commercial production restarted in 2015. Under the Consent Decree, after receiving notice from the FDA of being in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, each of the three facilities is subject to a five-year audit period by a third-party cGMP expert. A third-party expert continued to reassess the sites at various times through 2020. McNEIL-PPC is awaiting FDA inspections of the facilities which have been delayed due to COVID-19.

Reserved 18Item 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONOrganization and Business SegmentsDescription of the Company and Business SegmentsJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 134,500 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health (previously referred to as Consumer), Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, skin health/beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and eye health fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments.In all of its product lines, the Company competes with other companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.Management’s Objectives With “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to ensure health for people today and for future generations. United around this common ambition, the Company is poised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it competes. The Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2020 sales. In 2020, $12.2 billion was invested in research and development and $7.3 billion spent on acquisitions, reflecting management’s commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. A critical driver of the Company’s success is the 134,500 diverse employees worldwide. Employees are empowered and inspired to lead with the Company’s Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to use the Company’s reach and size to advance the Company's purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence. This ensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. 19Results of OperationsAnalysis of Consolidated SalesFor discussion on results of operations and financial condition pertaining to the fiscal years 2019 and 2018 see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.In 2020, worldwide sales increased 0.6% to $82.6 billion as compared to an increase of 0.6% in 2019. These sales changes consisted of the following:Sales increase/(decrease) due to:20202019Volume3.5 %3.7 %Price(2.3)(0.9)Currency(0.6)(2.2)Total0.6 %0.6 %The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was a negative impact of 0.3% in 2020 and a negative impact of 1.7% in 2019. Sales by U.S. companies were $43.1 billion in 2020 and $42.1 billion in 2019. This represents increases of 2.5% in 2020 and 0.5% in 2019. Sales by international companies were $39.5 billion in 2020 and $40.0 billion in 2019. This represents a decrease of 1.3% in 2020 and an increase of 0.7% in 2019.The five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.3%, 3.9% and 2.8%, respectively. The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.0%, 3.9% and 2.1%, respectively.In 2020, sales by companies in Europe achieved growth of 2.8% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 2.0% and a positive currency impact of 0.8%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) experienced a sales decline of 10.2% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 0.4% offset by a negative currency impact of 10.6%. Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region experienced a sales decline of 2.7% as compared to the prior year, including an operational decline of 3.1% partially offset by a positive currency impact of 0.4%.The 2020 results benefited from the inclusion of a 53rd week. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Annual Closing Date details). The Company estimated that the fiscal year 2020 sales growth rate was enhanced by approximately 1.0%. While the additional week added a few days to sales, it also added a full week's worth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible.In 2020, the Company utilized three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 16.0%, 12.0% and 12.0% of the total consolidated revenues. In 2019, the Company had three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 15.0%, 12.0% and 11.0% of the total consolidated revenues. Note: values may have been rounded 20 Analysis of Sales by Business SegmentsConsumer Health SegmentConsumer Health segment sales in 2020 were $14.1 billion, an increase of 1.1% from 2019, which included 3.0% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 1.9%. U.S. Consumer Health segment sales were $6.4 billion, an increase of 9.0%. International sales were $7.7 billion, a decrease of 4.6%, which included an operational decline of 1.3% and a negative currency impact of 3.3%.

Growth was primarily attributable to sales from TYLENOL® driven by COVID-19 stocking demand, ZYRTEC® due to competitor product out of stock and PEPCID® due to competitive product withdrawal both in the U.S., and increased consumption in anti-smoking aids. International sales were negatively impacted by COVID-19 and low incidence of cough and flu.The Skin Health/Beauty franchise sales were $4.5 billion in 2020, a decrease of 3.1% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily due to negative COVID-19 related impacts and SKU rationalization partially offset by growth in eCommerce and new product innovation. The Oral Care franchise sales of $1.6 billion increased 7.4% as compared to the prior year primarily attributable to sales of LISTERINE® mouthwash due to U.S. eCommerce and club channel growth, increased stocking demand related to COVID-19 and new product launches in Asia Pacific. The Baby Care franchise sales were $1.5 billion in 2020, a decrease of 9.4% compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily due to COVID-19 related impacts, SKU rationalization and the Baby Center divestiture in the U.S. partially offset by strength in AVEENO® baby. The Women’s Health franchise sales were $0.9 billion in 2020, a decrease of 8.6% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by COVID-19 impacts. The Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $0.7 billion in 2020, an increase of 7.2% as compared to the prior year. Growth was due to strong performance of NEOSPORIN® and BAND-AID® Brand Adhesive Bandages and COVID-19 related demand in the Asia Pacific region. 21Pharmaceutical SegmentPharmaceutical segment sales in 2020 were $45.6 billion, an increase of 8.0% from 2019, which included operational growth of 8.2% and a negative currency impact of 0.2%. U.S. sales were $25.7 billion, an increase of 7.8%. International sales were $19.8 billion, an increase of 8.3%, which included 8.8% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 0.5%. In 2020, acquisitions and divestitures had a net negative impact of 0.2% on the operational sales growth of the worldwide Pharmaceutical segment. Adjustments to previous reserve estimates positively impacted the Pharmaceutical segment operational growth by approximately 1.0% in both fiscal years 2020 and 2019.Major Pharmaceutical Therapeutic Area Sales*:% Change(Dollars in Millions)20202019’20 vs. ’19Total Immunology$15,055 13,950 7.9 % REMICADE®3,747 4,380 (14.4) SIMPONI®/SIMPONI ARIA®2,243 2,188 2.6 STELARA®7,707 6,361 21.1 TREMFYA®1,347 1,012 33.2 Other Immunology11 10 6.4 Total Infectious Diseases3,574 3,413 4.7 EDURANT®/rilpivirine964 861 11.9 PREZISTA®/ PREZCOBIX®/REZOLSTA®/SYMTUZA®2,184 2,110 3.5 Other Infectious Diseases427 441 (3.2)Total Neuroscience6,548 6,328 3.5 CONCERTA®/methylphenidate622 696 (10.6) INVEGA SUSTENNA®/XEPLION®/INVEGA TRINZA®/TREVICTA®3,653 3,330 9.7 RISPERDAL CONSTA®642 688 (6.8) Other Neuroscience1,632 1,614 1.1 Total Oncology12,367 10,692 15.7 DARZALEX®4,190 2,998 39.8 ERLEADA®(1)760 332 ** IMBRUVICA®4,128 3,411 21.0 VELCADE®408 751 (45.7) ZYTIGA® /abiraterone acetate2,470 2,795 (11.6) Other Oncology413 407 1.7 Total Pulmonary Hypertension 3,148 2,623 20.0 OPSUMIT®1,639 1,327 23.5 UPTRAVI®1,093 819 33.5 Other Pulmonary Hypertension (2)416 476 (12.8)Total Cardiovascular / Metabolism / Other4,878 5,192 (6.0) XARELTO®2,345 2,313 1.4 INVOKANA®/ INVOKAMET®795 735 8.2 PROCRIT®/EPREX®552 790 (30.2) Other1,186 1,353 (12.4)Total Pharmaceutical Sales$45,572 42,198 8.0 %*Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation** Percentage greater than 100% or not meaningful(1) Previously included in Other Oncology(2) Inclusive of TRACLEER® which was previously disclosed separately 22Immunology products sales were $15.1 billion in 2020, representing an increase of 7.9% as compared to the prior year driven by strong uptake of STELARA® (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis and strength in TREMFYA® (guselkumab) in Psoriasis. This was partially offset by COVID-19 related demand and lower sales of REMICADE® (infliximab) due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition. The patents for REMICADE® (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE® have been introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE® in those markets. Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE® in markets outside the United States. In the United States, a biosimilar version of REMICADE® was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the U.S. market will result in a further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE®. Infectious disease products sales were $3.6 billion in 2020, representing an increase of 4.7% as compared to the prior year primarily due to strong sales of SYMTUZA® and JULUCA®. This was partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA® and PREZCOBIX®/REZOLSTA® due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA® in certain countries outside the U.S. Neuroscience products sales were $6.5 billion, representing an increase of 3.5% as compared to the prior year. Paliperidone long-acting injectables growth driven by sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA®/XEPLION® (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA®/TREVICTA® from new patient starts and persistence. The growth was partially offset by migration from RISPERDAL CONSTA® (risperidone) and declines in CONCERTA® (methylphenidate) due to competitive entrants.Oncology products achieved sales of $12.4 billion in 2020, representing an increase of 15.7% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX® (daratumumab) driven by patient uptake in all lines of therapy and the launch of a subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and E.U.; IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) due to market growth globally and maintaining strong share and the continued global launch uptake and share gains of ERLEADA® (apalutamide). Additionally, the growth was negatively impacted by declining sales of ZYTIGA® (abiraterone acetate) and VELCADE® (bortezomib) due to generic competition. Pulmonary Hypertension products achieved sales of $3.1 billion, representing an increase of 20.0% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of OPSUMIT® (macitentan) and UPTRAVI® (selexipag) were due to continued share gains and market growth. Additionally, sales of TRACLEER® (bosentan) were negatively impacted by generics and migration to OPSUMIT®. Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $4.9 billion, a decline of 6.0% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of INVOKANA®/INVOKAMET® (canagliflozin) were due to market growth and favorable channel mix dynamics in the U.S. and strength in the European region partially offset by U.S. share declines due to competitive pressures. The growth of XARELTO® (rivaroxaban) was due to demand growth partially offset by higher rebates. Lower sales of PROCRIT®/ EPREX® (epoetin alfa) were due to biosimilar competition. 23During 2020, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows:Product Name (Chemical Name)IndicationUS ApprovalEU ApprovalUS FilingEU FilingAmivantamab Treatment of Patients with Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutations••DARZALEX® (daratumumab)Combination Regimen for Newly Diagnosed, Transplant-eligible Patients with Multiple Myeloma•DARZALEX® (daratumumab)Combination with Carfilzomib and Dexamethasone for patients with Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma•DARZALEX® FASPRO (daratumumab and hyaluronidase)Subcutaneous Formulation of Daratumumab in the Treatment of Patients with Multiple Myeloma•• ERLEADA® (apalutamide)Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer •IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib)In combination with Rituximab for treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia•INVOKANA® (canagliflozin)Treatment of Diabetic Kidney Disease•rilpivirine and cabotegravirFor Monthly, Injectable, Two Drug Regimen for Treatment of HIV••Paliperidone Pamitate 6-monthTreatment of Schizophrenia••PonesimodTreatment of adults with Relapsed Multiple Sclerosis••SIMPONI ARIA® (golimumab)Treatment of Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and Juvenile Psoriatic Arthritis•SIRTURO® (bedaquiline)Combination Therapy to Treat Children with Pulmonary Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis••SPRAVATO® (esketamine)Rapid Reduction of Depressive Symptoms in Adults with Major Depressive Disorder who have Active Suicidal Ideation with Intent•STELARA® (ustekinumab)Treatment of Pediatric Patients with Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis••TREMFYA® (guselkumab)Treatment of Adults with Active Psoriatic Arthritis••Uptravi® IVPulmonary arterial hypertension•XARELTO® (rivaroxaban) New Indication to Expand Use in Patients with Peripheral Artery Disease•ZABDENO (Ad26.ZEBOV) and MVABEA (MVA-BN-Filo)Preventive Ebola Vaccine• 24Medical Devices SegmentThe Medical Devices segment sales in 2020 were $23.0 billion, a decrease of 11.6% from 2019, which included an operational decrease of 11.4% and a negative currency impact of 0.2%.

The decline in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 and competitive pressures in the U.S. This was partially offset by the success of new products outside the U.S. and the recovery of an isolated supply disruption in the prior year related to SURGIFLO® . The decline in General Surgery was primarily driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 and the ASP divestiture.The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $7.8 billion in 2020, a decrease of 12.2% from 2019. The decline in hips was driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 partially offset by a leadership position in the Anterior approach, strong market demand for the ACTIS® stem and enabling technologies – KINCISE™ and VELYS™ Hip Navigation. The decline in knees was driven by the negative impact of COVID-19. The decline in Trauma was driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 partially offset by strength from new products. The decline in Spine, Sports & Other was driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 partially offset by the uptake of new products. The Vision franchise sales were of $3.9 billion in 2020, a decrease of 15.2% from 2019. The Contact Lenses/Other operational decline was due to the negative impact of COVID-19. The Surgical operational decline was primarily driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 and competitive pressures in the U.S. The Interventional Solutions franchise achieved sales of $3.0 billion in 2020, an increase of 1.6% from 2019. Growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by Atrial Fibrillation procedure growth coupled with strength from new products and market recovery offsetting negative impacts from COVID-19. 25Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on IncomeConsolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was $16.5 billion and $17.3 billion for the years 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Research and Development increased as a percent to sales primarily driven by:•Segment mix driven by a higher percentage of sales generated by the Pharmaceutical business versus the prior year •The negative COVID-19 impact on Medical Devices sales•Increased investment in the Medical Devices business related to robotics and digital programs•Portfolio progression including the COVID-19 vaccine in the Pharmaceutical business, net of governmental reimbursements Research facilities are located in the U.S., Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom with additional R&D support in over 30 other countries.In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In fiscal year 2020, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to a partial impairment due to timing and progression of one of the digital surgery platforms acquired with the Auris Health acquisition. In the fiscal year 2019, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion for the remaining intangible asset value related to the development program of AL-8176, an investigational drug for the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) acquired with the 2014 acquisition of Alios Biopharma Inc. The impairment charge was based on additional information, including clinical data, which became available and led to the Company's decision to abandon the development of AL-8176. Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), unrealized gains and losses on investments, gains and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. Other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2020 was unfavorable by $0.4 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to the following:(Dollars in Billions)(Income)/Expense20202019ChangeLitigation expense(1)$5.1 5.1 — Acquisition and Integration related(2)(1.1)0.3 (1.4)Unrealized (gains)/losses on securities(0.5)(0.6)0.1 Equity step-up gain related to DR.

This was primarily due to reduced interest income resulting from lower rates of interest earned on cash balances and a higher average debt balance. This was partially offset by a lower average debt interest rate and a higher average cash balance. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $25.2 billion at the end of 2020, and averaged $22.2 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $19.3 billion and $19.5 billion average cash balance in 2019. The total debt balance at the end of 2020 was $35.3 billion with an average debt balance of $31.5 billion as compared to $27.7 billion at the end of 2019 and an average debt balance of $29.1 billion. In the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued approximately $5.0 billion of commercial paper, with approximately $0.8 billion outstanding at year end. In the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $7.5 billion.

Consumer Health Segment: In 2020, the Consumer Health segment loss before tax as a percent of sales was (7.6)% versus income before tax of 14.8% in 2019. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following:•Higher litigation expense of $3.9 billion in 2020 vs. $0.4 billion in 2019 (primarily associated with talc related reserves and certain settlements) •The fiscal year 2019 included a gain of $0.3 billion related to the Company's previously held equity investment in DR. CI:LABO partially offset by:•Portfolio and investment optimization including execution of the ongoing SKU rationalization program Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2020, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 33.9% versus 20.9% in 2019. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following:•Lower litigation expense of $0.8 billion in 2020 vs. $4.3 billion in 2019 (primarily related to the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation, of which $1.0 billion is in 2020 and $4.0 billion is in 2019)•An in-process research and development charge of $0.9 billion in fiscal 2019 related to Alios•Lower acquisition and integration related costs in fiscal 2020•Leveraging in selling, marketing and administrative expense Medical Devices Segment: In 2020, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 13.3% versus 28.1% in 2019. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily driven by the following:•A gain of $2.0 billion related to the ASP divestiture recorded in the fiscal 2019•Idle capacity costs associated with COVID-19 related production slow downs in fiscal 2020•Establishment of obsolescence reserves and fixed cost deleveraging associated with the impact of COVID-19 in fiscal 2020•The negative impact of COVID-19 on sales in fiscal 2020 28•An in-process research and development charge of $0.2 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily related to the Auris Health acquisition partially offset by:•A contingent consideration reversal of approximately $1.1 billion in fiscal 2020 related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the Auris Health acquisition•Litigation expense was $0.3 billion in 2020 vs. $0.4 billion in 2019 Restructuring: In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its global supply chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its network. Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 to $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. In 2020, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.4 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.2 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $1.3 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced.See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 10.8% in 2020 and 12.7% in 2019. During the fiscal first quarter of 2021, the Internal Revenue Service published final regulations addressing the requirements for tax deductibility of settlement payments. The Company recorded a pre-tax reserve for $4.0 billion in the fiscal year 2019 based on the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation and recorded an additional pre-tax $1.0 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2020 upon which an effective rate of 21.4% has been applied. For discussion related to the fiscal 2020 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesLiquidity & Cash FlowsCash and cash equivalents were $14.0 billion at the end of 2020 as compared to $17.3 billion at the end of 2019. The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $3.3 billion decrease were:(Dollars In Billions)$17.3 Q4 2019 Cash and cash equivalents balance23.5 cash generated from operating activities(20.8)net cash used by investing activities(6.1)net cash used by financing activities0.1 effect of exchange rate and rounding$14.0 Q4 2020 Cash and cash equivalents balanceIn addition, the Company had $11.2 billion in marketable securities at the end of fiscal year 2020 and $2.0 billion at the end of fiscal year 2019.

As of January 3, 2021, the net debt position was $10.1 billion as compared to the prior year of $8.4 billion. There was an increase in the net debt position due to increased borrowings in the fiscal third quarter of 2020. The debt balance at the end of 2020 was $35.3 billion as compared to $27.7 billion in 2019. Considering recent market conditions and the on-going COVID-19 crisis, the Company has evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the talc litigation and agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation of which the majority may be paid over the next two to three years. In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. In the fiscal 30third quarter of 2020, the Company issued approximately $5.0 billion of commercial paper, with approximately $0.8 billion outstanding at year end. In the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $7.5 billion. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. acquisition which closed on October 1, 2020 and for general corporate purposes. Additionally, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. The following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of January 3, 2021: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.

The table does not include activity related to business combinations or the Company’s approximate $0.9 billion in contractual supply commitments associated with its development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Financing and Market RiskThe Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 3, 2021 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $121 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 3, 2021 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $148 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $1,667 million. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on credit support agreements.The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $36 million. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2020, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 9, 2021. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Swap Curve or other applicable marketrate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material. 31Total borrowings at the end of 2020 and 2019 were $35.3 billion and $27.7 billion, respectively. The increase in borrowings was the issuance of notes in 2020 when market conditions were favorable. In 2020, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $10.1 billion compared to net debt of $8.4 billion in 2019. Total debt represented 35.8% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2020 and 31.8% of total capital in 2019. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2020 was $24.04 compared to $22.59 at year-end 2019.A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.DividendsThe Company increased its dividend in 2020 for the 58th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $3.98 per share in 2020 and $3.75 per share in 2019. On January 4, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.01 per share, payable on March 9, 2021 to shareholders of record as of February 23, 2021. Other InformationCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.The extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not limited to, the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 3, 2021 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and associated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 3, 2021, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2020 and 2019. 32Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact. Below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019.Consumer Health Segment(Dollars in Millions)Balance atBeginning of PeriodAccrualsPayments/CreditsBalance atEnd of Period2020 Accrued rebates (1)$284 793 (788)289 Accrued returns63 138 (125)76 Accrued promotions487 1,988 (2,047)428 Subtotal$834 2,919 (2,960)793 Reserve for doubtful accounts35 7 (3)39 Reserve for cash discounts17 201 (206)12 Total$886 3,127 (3,169)844 2019 Accrued rebates(1)$271 841 (828)284 Accrued returns57 128 (122)63 Accrued promotions497 2,119 (2,129)487 Subtotal$825 3,088 (3,079)834 Reserve for doubtful accounts32 21 (18)35 Reserve for cash discounts23 198 (204)17 Total$880 3,307 (3,301)886 (1)Includes reserve for customer rebates of $66 million at January 3, 2021 and $54 million at December 29, 2019, recorded as a contra asset. 33Pharmaceutical Segment(Dollars in Millions)Balance atBeginning of PeriodAccrualsPayments/Credits(2)Balance atEnd of Period2020 Accrued rebates (1)$9,013 32,415 (31,591)9,837 Accrued returns500 233 (273)460 Accrued promotions5 10 (9)6 Subtotal$9,518 32,658 (31,873)10,303 Reserve for doubtful accounts36 24 (8)52 Reserve for cash discounts65 1,034 (1,029)70 Total$9,619 33,716 (32,910)10,425 2019 Accrued rebates (1)$7,510 26,868 (25,365)9,013 Accrued returns436 354 (290)500 Accrued promotions13 17 (25)5 Subtotal$7,959 27,239 (25,680)9,518 Reserve for doubtful accounts47 2 (13)36 Reserve for cash discounts53 936 (924)65 Total$8,059 28,177 (26,617)9,619 (1)Includes reserve for customer rebates of $174 million at January 3, 2021 and $93 million at December 29, 2019, recorded as a contra asset.

The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.7 billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. During the fiscal first quarter of 2021, the Internal Revenue Service published final regulations addressing the requirements for tax deductibility of settlement payments. The Company recorded a pre-tax reserve for $4.0 billion in fiscal 2019 based on the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation and recorded an additional pre-tax $1.0 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2020 upon which an effective rate of 21.4% has been applied. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. See Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings.Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates.Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. Prior to fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market value was calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant: operational sales, adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. Beginning in fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market value is calculated for the two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of January 3, 2021. 35Economic and Market FactorsCOVID-19 considerations and business continuity The Company has considered various internal and external factors in assessing the potential impact of COVID-19 on its business and financial results based upon information available at this time, as follows:•Operating Model: The Company has a diversified business model across the healthcare industry with flexibility designed into its manufacturing, research and development clinical operations and commercial capabilities. •Supply Chain: The Company continues to leverage its global manufacturing footprint and dual-source capabilities while closely monitoring and maintaining critical inventory at major distribution centers away from high-risk areas to ensure adequate and effective distribution. •Business Continuity: The robust, active business continuity plans across the Company's network have been instrumental in preparing the Company for events like COVID-19 and the ability to meet the majority of patient and consumer needs remains uninterrupted. •Workforce: The Company has put procedures in place to protect its essential workforce in manufacturing, distribution, commercial and research operations while ensuring appropriate remote working protocols have been established for other employees. •Liquidity: The Company's high-quality credit rating allows the Company superior access to the financial capital markets for the foreseeable future. In the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued approximately $5.0 billion of commercial paper, with approximately $0.8 billion outstanding at year end, for additional liquidity. Additionally, in the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $7.5 billion. The net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. acquisition on October 1, 2020 and for general corporate purposes.•Domestic and Foreign Legislation: The Company will continue to assess and evaluate the on-going global legislative efforts to combat the COVID-19 impact on economies and the sectors in which it participates. Currently, the recent legislative acts put in place are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s operations. In fiscal 2020, the Company entered into a series of contract manufacturing arrangements for vaccine production with third party contract manufacturing organizations. These arrangements provide the Company with future supplemental commercial capacity for vaccine production and potentially transferable rights to such production if capacity is not required. Amounts paid and contractually obligated to be paid to these contract manufacturing organizations of approximately $0.9 billion are reflected in the prepaid expenses and other, other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities accounts in the Company's consolidated balance sheet upon execution of each agreement. Additionally, the Company has entered into certain vaccine development cost sharing arrangements with government related organizations. The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2010 - 2020, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for health care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.In June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to as “Brexit”. The U.K. officially exited the E.U. on January 31, 2020, however, there was a transition period to allow time to agree the terms of a new trade deal. On December 30, 2020, the U.K., E.U. and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) signed the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). Over the last few years, Brexit has created global political and economic uncertainty and has led to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in regulations. While the UK and EU have now agreed on a future trade and cooperation agreement, it is still unclear what the ultimate financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have. However, the Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or operating results. As of January 3, 2021, the business of the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries represented less than 6% of the Company’s consolidated assets and less than 3% of the Company's fiscal twelve months revenues.The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2020 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $384 million and net income by approximately $115 million. 36Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. Legal ProceedingsJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 3, 2021, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.Common Stock The Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ.

200406,JNJ,JOHNSON & JOHNSON,2022,"Item 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONOrganization and Business SegmentsDescription of the Company and Business SegmentsJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-the-Counter pharmaceutical, Women’s Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments.In all of its product lines, the Company competes with other companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.Management’s Objectives With “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity.

This ensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. 21Results of OperationsAnalysis of Consolidated SalesFor discussion on results of operations and financial condition pertaining to the fiscal years 2020 and 2019 see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.In 2021, worldwide sales increased 13.6% to $93.8 billion as compared to an increase of 0.6% in 2020. These sales changes consisted of the following:Sales increase/(decrease) due to:20212020Volume12.9 %3.5 %Price(0.7)(2.3)Currency1.4 (0.6)Total13.6 %0.6 %The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was a negative impact of 0.6% in 2021 and a negative impact of 0.3% in 2020. Sales by U.S. companies were $47.2 billion in 2021 and $43.1 billion in 2020. This represents increases of 9.3% in 2021 and 2.5% in 2020. Sales by international companies were $46.6 billion in 2021 and $39.5 billion in 2020. This represents an increase of 18.2% in 2021 and a decrease of 1.3% in 2020.The five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 5.5%, 4.5% and 6.5%, respectively. The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.7%, 5.0% and 2.6%, respectively.In 2021, sales by companies in Europe achieved growth of 24.3% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 20.7% and a positive currency impact of 3.6%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) achieved growth of 7.8% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 7.3% and a positive currency impact of 0.5%. Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region achieved growth of 14.1% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 11.4% and a positive currency impact of 2.7%.The Company estimated that the inclusion of a 53rd week in the fiscal year 2020 results negatively impacted the 2021 comparative sales growth by approximately 1.0%. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Annual Closing Date details). While the additional week added a few days to sales, it also added a full week's worth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible.In 2021, the Company utilized three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 14.0%, 11.0% and 11.0% of the total consolidated revenues. In 2020, the Company had three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 16.0%, 12.0% and 12.0% of the total consolidated revenues. Note: values may have been rounded 22 Analysis of Sales by Business SegmentsConsumer Health SegmentConsumer Health segment sales in 2021 were $14.6 billion, an increase of 4.1% from 2020, which included 2.8% operational growth and a positive currency impact of 1.3%. U.S. Consumer Health segment sales were $6.5 billion, an increase of 2.4%. International sales were $8.1 billion, an increase of 5.6%, which included 3.1% operational growth and a positive currency impact of 2.5%.

Growth was primarily attributable to Analgesics, TYLENOL® and MOTRIN®, digestive health and the hydration benefit offering (ORSL).The Skin Health/Beauty franchise sales of $4.5 billion increased 2.0% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily due to COVID-19 recovery, strong performance of NEUTROGENA® and AVEENO®, and eCommerce acceleration partially offset by the divestiture of DR. CI:LABO - Sedona business in Asia Pacific and external supply constraints. The Oral Care franchise sales of $1.6 billion increased 0.2% as compared to the prior year. Market growth in the U.S. along with strong performance in the Asia Pacific region due to successful brand building and promotional campaigns and the positive impact of currency offset the negative impact of the floss divestiture and U.S. external supply constraints. The Baby Care franchise sales of $1.6 billion increased 3.2% compared to the prior year. Growth was driven by AVEENO® Asia Pacific eCommerce strength, innovation and COVID-19 recovery. The Women’s Health franchise sales of $0.9 billion increased 1.8% as compared to the prior year primarily driven by COVID-19 market recovery, favorable price and strong brand building in Asia Pacific partially offset by disruptions in Europe due to flooding.The Wound Care/Other franchise sales of $0.7 billion increased 2.6% as compared to the prior year. Growth was due to strong performance of BAND-AID® Brand Adhesive Bandages in the U.S. partially offset by product discontinuations and competitive pressures in Asia Pacific. In November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after initial announcement. 23Pharmaceutical SegmentPharmaceutical segment sales in 2021 were $52.1 billion, an increase of 14.3% from 2020, which included operational growth of 13.1% and a positive currency impact of 1.2%. U.S. sales were $28.0 billion, an increase of 8.6%. International sales were $24.1 billion, an increase of 21.6%, which included 18.8% operational growth and a positive currency impact of 2.8%. In 2021, acquisitions and divestitures had a net negative impact of 0.5% on the operational sales growth of the worldwide Pharmaceutical segment. Adjustments to previous sales reserve estimates were approximately $0.7 billion and $0.6 billion in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.Major Pharmaceutical Therapeutic Area Sales*:% Change(Dollars in Millions)20212020’21 vs. ’20Total Immunology$16,750 15,055 11.3 % REMICADE®3,190 3,747 (14.9) SIMPONI®/SIMPONI ARIA®2,276 2,243 1.4 STELARA®9,134 7,707 18.5 TREMFYA®2,127 1,347 57.9 Other Immunology24 11 **Total Infectious Diseases5,861 3,574 64.0 COVID-19 VACCINE2,385 — ** EDURANT®/rilpivirine994 964 3.1 PREZISTA®/ PREZCOBIX®/REZOLSTA®/SYMTUZA®2,083 2,184 (4.6) Other Infectious Diseases399 427 (6.5)Total Neuroscience7,011 6,548 7.1 CONCERTA®/methylphenidate667 622 7.3 INVEGA SUSTENNA®/XEPLION®/INVEGA TRINZA®/TREVICTA®4,022 3,653 10.1 RISPERDAL CONSTA®592 642 (7.7) Other Neuroscience1,729 1,632 6.0 Total Oncology14,548 12,367 17.6 DARZALEX®6,023 4,190 43.8 ERLEADA®1,291 760 70.0 IMBRUVICA®4,369 4,128 5.8 ZYTIGA® /abiraterone acetate2,297 2,470 (7.0) Other Oncology(1)568 821 (30.8)Total Pulmonary Hypertension 3,450 3,148 9.6 OPSUMIT®1,819 1,639 11.0 UPTRAVI®1,237 1,093 13.1 Other Pulmonary Hypertension395 416 (5.0)Total Cardiovascular / Metabolism / Other4,460 4,878 (8.6) XARELTO®2,438 2,345 4.0 INVOKANA®/ INVOKAMET®563 795 (29.3) PROCRIT®/EPREX®479 552 (13.3) Other981 1,186 (17.3)Total Pharmaceutical Sales$52,080 45,572 14.3 %*Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation** Percentage greater than 100% or not meaningful(1) Inclusive of VELCADE® which was previously disclosed separately 24Immunology products achieved sales of $16.8 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 11.3% as compared to the prior year driven by strong uptake of STELARA® (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis and strength in TREMFYA® (guselkumab) in Psoriasis and uptake in Psoriatic Arthritis. This was partially offset by lower sales of REMICADE® (infliximab) due to biosimilar competition. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE® have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United States and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE®. The latest expiring United States patent for STELARA® (ustekinumab) will expire in September 2023. STELARA® (ustekinumab) U.S. sales in fiscal 2021 were approximately $5.9 billion. The expiration of a product patent or loss of market exclusivity is likely to result in a reduction in sales. Infectious disease products achieved sales of $5.9 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 64.0% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by the contribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. This was partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA® and PREZCOBIX®/REZOLSTA® (darunavir/cobicistat) due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA® in certain countries outside the U.S.Neuroscience products achieved sales of $7.0 billion, representing an increase of 7.1% as compared to the prior year. Paliperidone long-acting injectables growth was driven by sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA®/XEPLION® (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA®/TREVICTA® from new patient starts and persistence as well as the launch of INVEGA HAFYERA™. Oncology products achieved sales of $14.5 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 17.6% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX® (daratumumab) driven by continued strong market growth, share gains in all regions and solid uptake of the subcutaneous formulation launched in 2020; the continued global launch uptake of ERLEADA® (apalutamide) and IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) growth primarily driven by market and continued share leadership. The growth of IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) was partially offset by competitive pressures from novel oral agents and COVID-19 related market dynamics including delays in new patient starts.Pulmonary Hypertension products achieved sales of $3.5 billion, representing an increase of 9.6% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of OPSUMIT® (macitentan) and UPTRAVI® (selexipag) were due to continued share gains and market growth. Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $4.5 billion, a decline of 8.6% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily attributable to lower sales of INVOKANA®/INVOKAMET® (canagliflozin) due to share erosion and PROCRIT®/ EPREX® (epoetin alfa) due to biosimilar competition. 25During 2021, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows:Product Name (Chemical Name)IndicationUS ApprovalEU ApprovalUS FilingEU FilingBYANNLI® Maintenance Treatment of Schizophrenia in Adults•CABENUVA (rilpivirine and cabotegravir)HIV treatment for use every two months•COVID-19 Vaccine COVID-19 Emergency Use••COVID-19 Vaccine Booster ShotCOVID-19 Emergency Use••DARZALEX® (daratumumab)Subcutaneous (SC) formulation Treatment for Newly Diagnosed Systemic Light Chain Amyloidosis and Gains an Additional Approval in Pre-Treated Multiple Myeloma•DARZALEX FASPRO® (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj)Combination with Carfilzomib and Dexamethasone for Patients with Multiple Myeloma After First or Subsequent Relapse•INVEGA HAFYERA (paliperidone palmitate)First and Only Twice-Yearly Treatment for Adults with Schizophrenia•PONVORY (Ponesimod)Treatment of Adults with Relapsing Forms of Multiple Sclerosis with Active Disease Defined by Clinical or Imaging Features•PONVORY (Ponesimod)Oral Treatment for Adults with Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis •RYBREVANT (amivantamab-vmjw)Treatment for Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutations•SPRAVATO® (esketamine)Rapid reduction of depressive symptoms in a psychiatric emergency for patients with major depressive disorder•STELARA® (ustekinumab)Treatment of Pediatric Patients with Juvenille Psoriatic Arthritis•TeclistamabTreatment of Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma•UPTRAVI®(selexipag)Intravenous Use in Adult Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)•XARELTO® (rivaroxaban)Help Prevent and Treat Blood Clots in Pediatric Patients••XARELTO® (rivaroxaban)Expanded Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) Indication to Include Patients After Lower-Extremity Revascularization (LER)• 26Medical Devices SegmentThe Medical Devices segment sales in 2021 were $27.1 billion, an increase of 17.9% from 2020, which included operational growth of 16.2% and a positive currency impact of 1.7%. U.S. sales were $12.7 billion, an increase of 14.9% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $14.4 billion, an increase of 20.6% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 17.3% and a positive currency impact of 3.3%. In 2021, the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the Medical Devices segment worldwide operational sales growth was a negative 0.6% primarily due to the divestiture of Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP). The Company has seen a market recovery in global procedural volumes in the Medical Devices segment as compared to the prior year which had significant negative impacts from COVID-19. This procedural volume recovery is the primary driver of sales and earnings growth as compared to the prior year.

The growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by Endocutter, Biosurgery and Energy products attributable to market recovery, market expansion and the success of new products offsetting competitive pressures in the U.S. The growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by market recovery and the continued strength of the suture portfolio partially offset by the impact of the ASP divestiture in the prior year.The Orthopaedics franchise achieved sales of $8.6 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 10.6% from 2020. The growth in hips reflects the market recovery combined with continued strength of the portfolio including the ACTIS® stem and enabling technologies – KINCISE™ and VELYS™ Hip Navigation. The growth in knees was primarily driven by procedure recovery and new product introductions. The growth in Trauma was driven by global market recovery and uptake of new products. The growth in Spine, Sports & Other was primarily driven by procedure recovery and new product introductions. The Vision franchise achieved sales of $4.7 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 19.6% from 2020. The Contact Lenses/Other operational growth was due to market recovery and market share gains from new products. Surgical Vision operational growth was primarily due to market recovery and uptake of recently launched products. The Interventional Solutions franchise achieved sales of $4.0 billion in 2021, an increase of 30.4% from 2020. Growth in the electrophysiology and stroke businesses were driven by market recovery and success of new products and commercial strategies. Beginning in the fiscal first quarter of 2022, the Medical Devices segment will be referred to as the MedTech segment. 27Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on IncomeConsolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was $22.8 billion and $16.5 billion for the years 2021 and 2020, respectively. As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was 24.3% and 20.0%, in 2021 and 2020, respectively.(Dollars in billions. Percentages in chart are as a percent to total sales)Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses:(Dollars in billions. Percentages in chart are as a percent to total sales)Cost of products sold decreased as a percent to sales driven by:•Non-recurring prior year COVID-19 production related slow-downs and related inventory impacts•Fixed cost deleveraging in the Medical Devices business in the fiscal 2020•Favorable mix within the Pharmaceutical business as well as at the enterprise level with a higher percentage of sales coming from the Pharmaceutical business•Supply chain efficiencies in the Consumer Health segment The intangible asset amortization expense included in cost of products sold was $4.7 billion for both fiscal years 2021 and 2020.28Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses decreased as a percent to sales driven by:•Leveraging in the Medical Devices business resulting from the recovery of sales from the prior years impact of COVID-19Partially offset by:•Increased brand marketing expenses in the Consumer Health businessResearch and Development Expense: Research and development expense by segment of business was as follows: 20212020(Dollars in Millions)Amount% of Sales*Amount% of Sales*Consumer Health$455 3.1 %$422 3.0 %Pharmaceutical11,882 22.8 9,563 21.0 Medical Devices2,377 8.8 2,174 9.5 Total research and development expense$14,714 15.7 %$12,159 14.7 %Percent increase/(decrease) over the prior year21.0 % 7.1 % *As a percent to segment sales Research and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and developmental milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. Research and Development increased as a percent to sales primarily driven by:•General portfolio progression in the Pharmaceutical business•COVID-19 vaccine expenses, net of governmental reimbursementsIn-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion primarily related to expected development delays in the general surgery digital robotics platform (Ottava) acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019. The impairment charge was calculated based on revisions to the discounted cash flow valuation model reflecting a delay of first in human procedures of approximately two years from the initial acquisition model assumption of the second half of 2022. The Company will continue to monitor the remaining $1.5 billion Ottava platform intangible asset as development program activities are ongoing. In fiscal year 2020, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to a partial impairment due to timing and progression of one of the digital surgery platforms acquired with the Auris Health acquisition. On January 28, 2022, subsequent to the fiscal year 2021, additional information regarding efficacy became available which led the Company to the decision to terminate the development of bermekimab for Atopic Dermatitis (AD). The Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $0.6 billion related to an in-process research and development asset, bermekimab (JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment of AD and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). The impairment charge is related to the AD indication and is a nonrecognized subsequent event and will be reflected in the first quarter 2022 financial statements. The Company acquired all rights to bermekimab from XBiotech, Inc. in fiscal year 2020.Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), unrealized gains and losses on investments, income and losses associated with certain employee benefit programs, gains and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. 29Other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2021 was favorable by $2.4 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to the following:(Dollars in Billions)(Income)/Expense20212020ChangeLitigation expense(1)$2.3 5.1 (2.8)Acquisition, Integration and Divestiture related(2)(0.5)(1.1)0.6 (Gains)/losses on securities(0.5)(0.5)0.0 Restructuring related0.1 0.1 0.0 Employee benefit plan related(0.6)(0.4)(0.2)Other(3)(0.3)(0.3)— Total Other (Income) Expense, Net$0.5 2.9 (2.4)(1)2021 is primarily related to talc and Risperdal. 2020 is primarily related to talc and the opioid litigation settlement.(2)2021 is primarily related to divestiture gains of two pharmaceutical brands outside the U.S. 2020 is primarily driven by a contingent consideration reversal of approximately $1.1 billion related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the Auris Health acquisition.(3)2021 includes Consumer Health separation costs of $0.1 billion. Costs in future years are expected to be significantly higher. Interest (Income) Expense: The fiscal year 2021 included net interest expense of $130 million as compared to $90 million net interest expense in the fiscal year 2020. This was primarily due to lower rates of interest earned on cash balances and a higher average debt balance, partially offset by the benefit from net investment hedging. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $31.6 billion at the end of 2021, and averaged $28.4 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $25.2 billion and $22.2 billion average cash balance in 2020. The total debt balance at the end of 2021 was $33.8 billion with an average debt balance of $34.5 billion as compared to $35.3 billion at the end of 2020 and an average debt balance of $31.5 billion.

Consumer Health Segment: In 2021, the Consumer Health segment income before tax as a percent of sales was 8.8% versus a loss before tax of 7.6% in 2020. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following:•2021 litigation expense includes $1.6 billion of talc expenses; 2020 includes $3.9 billion of talc expenses •Supply chain efficienciespartially offset by:•Increased brand marketing expenses and commodity inflation Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2021, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 34.9% versus 33.9% in 2020. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following:•Divestiture gains of $0.6 billion related to two pharmaceutical brands outside the U.S. in fiscal 2021•2021 litigation expense includes $0.6 billion primarily related to Risperdal; 2020 includes $0.8 billion primarily related to the opioid litigation settlementpartially offset by:•Research & Development investment in the COVID-19 vaccine net of governmental reimbursements and general portfolio progression 30 Medical Devices Segment: In 2021, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 16.2% versus 13.3% in 2020. The increase in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily driven by the following:•Recovery of prior year COVID-19 production related slow downs and related inventory impacts•Overall expense leveraging resulting from the Medical Devices sales recovery•Litigation expense of $0.1 billion in 2021 vs. $0.3 billion in 2020 partially offset by:•A contingent consideration reversal of approximately $1.1 billion in the fiscal 2020 related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the Auris Health acquisition•A higher IPR&D charge of $0.7 billion ($0.9 billion in 2021 related to the general surgery offering in digital robotics (Ottava) acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019) Restructuring: In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its Global Supply Chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its network. Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by the end of 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $2.1 to $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. In 2021, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.5 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.3 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $1.8 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. The program is set to be completed at the end of 2022.See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 8.3% in 2021 and 10.8% in 2020. For discussion related to the fiscal 2021 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesLiquidity & Cash FlowsCash and cash equivalents were $14.5 billion at the end of 2021 as compared to $14.0 billion at the end of 2020. The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $0.5 billion increase were:(Dollars In Billions)$14.0 Q4 2020 Cash and cash equivalents balance23.4 cash generated from operating activities(8.7)net cash used by investing activities(14.0)net cash used by financing activities(0.2)effect of exchange rate and rounding$14.5 Q4 2021 Cash and cash equivalents balanceIn addition, the Company had $17.1 billion in marketable securities at the end of fiscal year 2021 and $11.2 billion at the end of fiscal year 2020. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 31Cash flow from operations of $23.4 billion was the result of:(Dollars In Billions)$20.9 Net Earnings6.8 non-cash expenses and other adjustments primarily for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and asset write-downs partially offset by the deferred tax provision, net gain on sale of assets/businesses and credit losses and accounts receivable allowances(1.1)a decrease in current and non-current liabilities2.4 an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities (5.6)an increase in accounts receivable, inventories and other current and non-current assets$23.4 Cash Flow from operationsInvesting activities use of $8.7 billion of cash was primarily used for:(Dollars In Billions)$(3.7)additions to property, plant and equipment(5.4)net purchases of investments0.7 proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses, net0.2 Credit support agreements activity, net(0.1) acquisitions (0.4)other (primarily licenses and milestones) and rounding$(8.7)Net cash used for investing activitiesFinancing activities use of $14.0 billion of cash was primarily used for: (Dollars In Billions)$(11.0)dividends to shareholders (3.5)repurchase of common stock for employee share programs(1.0)net repayment from short and long term debt1.0 proceeds from stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, net0.3 Credit support agreements activity, net0.2 other and rounding$(14.0)Net cash used for financing activitiesAs of January 2, 2022, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 2, 2022, the net debt position was $2.1 billion as compared to the prior year of $10.1 billion. There was a decrease in the net debt position due to repayment of debt and an increase in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities generating from operations. The debt balance at the end of 2021 was $33.8 billion as compared to $35.3 billion in 2020. Considering recent market conditions and the on-going COVID-19 crisis, the Company has evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the Company's approximate $1.1 billion in contractual supply commitments associated with its development of the COVID-19 vaccine, the opioid litigation settlement for $5.0 billion and the establishment of the $2.0 billion trust for talc related liabilities (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. Effective beginning in fiscal 2022, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017 currently requires the Company to deduct U.S. and international research and development expenditures for tax purposes over 5 to 15 years, instead of in the current fiscal year. As a result, the Company is expecting an increase in annual cash tax payments to the U.S Treasury of an incremental $1.0 to 1.5 billion beginning in fiscal 2022. The Company will concurrently record a deferred tax benefit for the future amortization of the research and development (R&D) for tax purposes and therefore, the Company is not expecting a significant impact to its effective tax rate related to this change. The requirement to expense R&D as incurred is unchanged for U.S. GAAP purposes and the impact to pre-tax R&D expense is not affected by this provision. Additionally, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. During the fiscal third quarter of 322021, in accordance with the terms of the agreement associated with the acquisition of Actelion, the Company's undrawn credit facility with Idorsia was terminated. The following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of January 2, 2022: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.

The table does not include activity related to business combinations or the Company’s approximate $1.1 billion in contractual supply commitments associated with its development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Financing and Market RiskThe Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 2, 2022 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 2, 2022 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $2.2 billion. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on credit support agreements.The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $0.1 billion. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2021, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 8, 2022. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.Total borrowings at the end of 2021 and 2020 were $33.8 billion and $35.3 billion, respectively. The decrease in borrowings was due to the repayment of debt. In 2021, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $2.1 billion compared to net debt of $10.1 billion in 2020. Total debt represented 31.3% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2021 and 35.8% of total capital in 2020. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2021 was $28.16 compared to $24.04 at year-end 2020.A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 33DividendsThe Company increased its dividend in 2021 for the 59th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.19 per share in 2021 and $3.98 per share in 2020. On January 4, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.06 per share, payable on March 8, 2022 to shareholders of record as of February 22, 2022. Other InformationCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.The extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not limited to, the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 2, 2022 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and associated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 2, 2022, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2021 and 2020.Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in 34sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact. Below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021.Consumer Health Segment(Dollars in Millions)Balance atBeginning of PeriodAccrualsPayments/CreditsBalance atEnd of Period2021 Accrued rebates (1)$289 893 (895)287 Accrued returns76 136 (136)76 Accrued promotions428 1,958 (1,999)387 Subtotal$793 2,987 (3,030)750 Reserve for doubtful accounts39 0 (7)32 Reserve for cash discounts12 213 (210)15 Total$844 3,200 (3,247)797 2020 Accrued rebates(1)$284 793 (788)289 Accrued returns63 138 (125)76 Accrued promotions487 1,988 (2,047)428 Subtotal$834 2,919 (2,960)793 Reserve for doubtful accounts35 7 (3)39 Reserve for cash discounts17 201 (206)12 Total$886 3,127 (3,169)844 (1)Includes reserve for customer rebates of $80 million at January 2, 2022 and $66 million at January 3, 2021, recorded as a contra asset. 35Pharmaceutical Segment(Dollars in Millions)Balance atBeginning of PeriodAccrualsPayments/Credits(2)Balance atEnd of Period2021 Accrued rebates (1)$9,837 37,922 (37,428)10,331 Accrued returns460 345 (285)520 Accrued promotions6 13 (16)3 Subtotal10,303 38,280 (37,729)10,854 Reserve for doubtful accounts52 18 (20)50 Reserve for cash discounts70 1,163 (1,139)94 Total10,425 39,461 (38,888)10,998 2020 Accrued rebates (1)$9,013 32,415 (31,591)9,837 Accrued returns500 233 (273)460 Accrued promotions5 10 (9)6 Subtotal$9,518 32,658 (31,873)10,303 Reserve for doubtful accounts36 24 (8)52 Reserve for cash discounts65 1,034 (1,029)70 Total$9,619 33,716 (32,910)10,425 (1)Includes reserve for customer rebates of $218 million at January 2, 2022 and $174 million at January 3, 2021, recorded as a contra asset.

The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.7 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this cost. See Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. See Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings.Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, healthcare cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates.Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. Prior to fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market value was calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant: operational sales, adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. Beginning in fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market value is calculated for the two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of January 2, 2022. 37Economic and Market FactorsCOVID-19 considerations and business continuityThe Company has considered various internal and external factors in assessing the potential impact of COVID-19 on its business and financial results based upon information available at this time, as follows:•Operating Model: The Company has a diversified business model across the healthcare industry with flexibility designed into its manufacturing, research and development clinical operations and commercial capabilities. •Supply Chain: The Company continues to leverage its global manufacturing footprint and dual-source capabilities while closely monitoring and maintaining critical inventory at major distribution centers away from high-risk areas to help ensure adequate and effective distribution. •Business Continuity: The robust, active business continuity plans across the Company's network have been instrumental in preparing the Company for events like COVID-19 and the ability to meet the majority of patient and consumer needs remains uninterrupted. •Workforce: The Company has put procedures in place to protect its essential workforce in manufacturing, distribution, commercial and research operations while ensuring appropriate remote working protocols have been established for other employees. •Liquidity: The Company's high-quality credit rating allows the Company superior access to the financial capital markets for the foreseeable future. •Domestic and Foreign Legislation: The Company will continue to assess and evaluate the on-going global legislative efforts to combat the COVID-19 impact on economies and the sectors in which it participates. Currently, the recent legislative acts put in place are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s operations. In fiscal 2020 and 2021, the Company entered into a series of contract manufacturing arrangements for vaccine production with third party contract manufacturing organizations. These arrangements provide the Company with future supplemental commercial capacity for vaccine production and potentially transferable rights to such production if capacity is not required. Amounts paid for services to be delivered and contractually obligated to be paid to these contract manufacturing organizations of approximately $1.1 billion are reflected in the prepaid expenses and other, other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities accounts in the Company's consolidated balance sheet upon execution of each agreement. Additionally, the Company has entered into certain vaccine development cost sharing arrangements with government related organizations. The Company continues to evaluate and monitor both its internal and external supply arrangements, including its contract with Emergent BioSolutions and related production activities at its Bayview, Maryland facility. The Company has established a global vaccine supply network, where, in addition to its internal manufacturing site in Leiden, the Netherlands, ten other manufacturing sites will be involved in the production of vaccine across different countries and continents. The Company does not believe that a disruption at a vaccine manufacturing site, or the resulting delay would have a material financial impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or results.The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of healthcare. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2011 - 2021, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for healthcare products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2021 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $0.5 billion and net income by approximately $0.2 billion.Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. The Company faces various worldwide healthcare changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include healthcare cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of healthcare products. 38Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the U.S. FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. Legal ProceedingsJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, employment, indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 2, 2022, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information regarding legal proceedings.Common Stock The Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ.

200406,JNJ,JOHNSON & JOHNSON,2023,"Item 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONOrganization and Business SegmentsDescription of the Company and Business SegmentsJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 152,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and MedTech. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-the-Counter pharmaceutical, Women’s Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on the following therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and MedTech business segments.In all of its product lines, the Company competes with other companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.Management’s Objectives With “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to ensure health for people today and for future generations. United around this common ambition, the Company is poised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it competes. The Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2022 sales. In 2022, $14.6 billion was invested in research and development reflecting management’s commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. A critical driver of the Company’s success is the diversity of its 152,700 employees worldwide. Employees are empowered and inspired to lead with Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to use the Company’s reach and size to advance the Company’s purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence. This ensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. 21Results of OperationsAnalysis of Consolidated SalesFor discussion on results of operations and financial condition pertaining to the fiscal years 2021 and 2020 see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.In 2022, worldwide sales increased 1.3% to $94.9 billion as compared to an increase of 13.6% in 2021. These sales changes consisted of the following:Sales increase/(decrease) due to:20222021Volume6.9 %12.9 %Price(0.8)(0.7)Currency(4.8)1.4 Total1.3 %13.6 %The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was a negative impact of 0.1% in 2022 and a negative impact of 0.6% in 2021. Sales by U.S. companies were $48.6 billion in 2022 and $47.2 billion in 2021. This represents increases of 3.0% in 2022 and 9.3% in 2021. Sales by international companies were $46.4 billion in 2022 and $46.6 billion in 2021. This represents a decrease of 0.6% in 2022 and an increase of 18.2% in 2021.The five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 4.4%, 4.0% and 4.9%, respectively. The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.5%, 5.0% and 2.2%, respectively.In 2022, sales by companies in Europe experienced a decline of 0.6% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 11.0% and a negative currency impact of 11.6%.

Operational growth was primarily attributable to increased Cough/Cold/Flu, adult and pediatric incidences, price actions primarily in the U.S. and increased consumption in China due to easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Growth was partially offset by supply constraints.The Skin Health/Beauty franchise sales of $4.4 billion declined 4.2% as compared to the prior year. The operational decline was driven by supply constraints in the U.S. partially offset by price actions and strong new product performance in the Asia Pacific and Latin America region. The Oral Care franchise sales of $1.5 billion declined 8.5% as compared to the prior year. The operational decline was due to portfolio simplification in the U.S., competitive pressures in EMEA and China, category decline and pricing pressures in EMEA, as well as suspension of personal care sales in Russia and negative COVID-19 impacts in China. The Baby Care franchise sales of $1.5 billion declined 6.7% as compared to the prior year. The operational decline was driven by category deceleration and competitive pressures in the U.S., suspension of personal care sales in Russia and weakness in India.The Women’s Health franchise sales of $0.9 billion declined 1.5% as compared to the prior year. Operational growth driven by lapping prior year supply constraints in EMEA, strength in India, and price actions in LATAM was partially offset by suspension of personal care sales in Russia and negative currency impacts.The Wound Care/Other franchise sales of $0.7 billion declined 5.3% as compared to the prior year. The operational decline was driven by lapping strong prior year consumption, competitive pressure in the U.S., and decreased consumption in China. In November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business (Kenvue as the name for the planned New Consumer Health Company), with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company by the end of the fiscal year 2023. 23Pharmaceutical SegmentPharmaceutical segment sales in 2022 were $52.6 billion, an increase of 1.7% from 2021, which included operational growth of 6.7% and a negative currency impact of 5.0%. U.S. sales were $28.6 billion, an increase of 2.3%. International sales were $24.0 billion, an increase of 1.0%, which included 11.9% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 10.9%. In 2022, acquisitions and divestitures had a net negative impact of 0.1% on the operational sales growth of the worldwide Pharmaceutical segment. Adjustments to previous sales reserve estimates were approximately $0.1 billion and $0.7 billion in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.Major Pharmaceutical Therapeutic Area Sales*:TotalOperationsCurrency(Dollars in Millions)20222021ChangeChangeChangeTotal Immunology$16,935 16,750 1.1 %4.8 %(3.7)% REMICADE2,343 3,190 (26.6)(25.3)(1.3) SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA2,184 2,276 (4.0)1.0 (5.0) STELARA9,723 9,134 6.5 10.4 (3.9) TREMFYA2,668 2,127 25.4 30.1 (4.7) Other Immunology17 24 (28.2)(28.2)0.0 Total Infectious Diseases5,449 5,825 (6.5)0.8 (7.3) COVID-19 VACCINE2,179 2,385 (8.6)2.0 (10.6) EDURANT/rilpivirine1,008 994 1.5 11.8 (10.3)PREZISTA/ PREZCOBIX/REZOLSTA/ SYMTUZA1,943 2,083 (6.7)(4.4)(2.3) Other Infectious Diseases(2)318 363 (12.3)(7.2)(5.1)Total Neuroscience6,893 6,988 (1.4)3.4 (4.8) CONCERTA/methylphenidate644 667 (3.5)4.1 (7.6) INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION/ INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA4,140 4,022 3.0 6.9 (3.9) RISPERDAL CONSTA485 592 (18.1)(13.0)(5.1) Other Neuroscience(2)1,623 1,706 (4.9)0.4 (5.3)Total Oncology15,983 14,548 9.9 16.9 (7.0) DARZALEX7,977 6,023 32.4 39.5 (7.1) ERLEADA1,881 1,291 45.7 53.0 (7.3) IMBRUVICA3,784 4,369 (13.4)(7.6)(5.8) ZYTIGA /abiraterone acetate1,770 2,297 (22.9)(13.6)(9.3) Other Oncology571 568 0.6 6.0 (5.4)Total Pulmonary Hypertension 3,417 3,450 (1.0)3.0 (4.0) OPSUMIT1,783 1,819 (2.0)2.6 (4.6) UPTRAVI1,322 1,237 6.9 8.6 (1.7) Other Pulmonary Hypertension313 395 (20.8)(13.1)(7.7)Total Cardiovascular / Metabolism / Other3,887 4,119 (5.6)(4.0)(1.6) XARELTO2,473 2,438 1.4 1.4 — INVOKANA/ INVOKAMET448 563 (20.4)(17.2)(3.2) Other(1,2)966 1,119 (13.6)(9.3)(4.3)Total Pharmaceutical Sales$52,563 51,680 1.7 %6.7 %(5.0)%*Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation(1) Inclusive of PROCRIT / EPREX which was previously disclosed separately(2) Fiscal 2021 reflects approximately $0.4 billion of certain international OTC products, primarily in China, which were reclassified from the Pharmaceutical segment to the Consumer Health segment based on operational changes 24Immunology products achieved sales of $16.9 billion in 2022, representing an increase of 1.1% as compared to the prior year. Operational growth was driven by strong uptake of STELARA (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis and strength of TREMFYA (guselkumab) in Psoriasis and uptake in Psoriatic Arthritis. This was partially offset by lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) due to biosimilar competition. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United States and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE. The latest expiring United States patent for STELARA (ustekinumab) will expire in September 2023. STELARA (ustekinumab) U.S. sales in fiscal 2022 were approximately $6.4 billion and the expiration of this product patent or loss of market exclusivity will result in a reduction in sales. Infectious disease products sales were $5.4 billion in 2022, representing a decline of 6.5% as compared to the prior year. Operational growth was driven by the COVID-19 vaccine outside the U.S partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA and PREZCOBIX/REZOLSTA (darunavir/cobicistat) due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA in certain countries outside the U.S.Neuroscience products sales were $6.9 billion, in 2022, representing a decline of 1.4% as compared to the prior year. The operational sales growth of INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA from new patient starts and persistence as well as the launch of INVEGA HAFYERA was offset by negative currency impacts and lower sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA. Oncology products achieved sales of $16.0 billion in 2022, representing an increase of 9.9% as compared to the prior year. Contributions to operational growth were strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) driven by share gains in all regions, continued strong market growth, and uptake of the subcutaneous formulation as well as the continued global launch uptake of ERLEADA (apalutamide). This was partially offset by declining sales of IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) due to competitive pressures and market suppression and ZYTIGA due to loss of exclusivity in the European Union in the second half of 2022. Pulmonary Hypertension products sales were $3.4 billion, a decline of 1.0% as compared to the prior year. The operational sales growth of OPSUMIT (macitentan) and UPTRAVI (selexipag) due to continued share gains and market growth was offset by COVID-19 related impacts and continued declines in Other Pulmonary Hypertension. Cardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $3.9 billion, a decline of 5.6% as compared to the prior year. The operational decline was primarily attributable to lower sales of INVOKANA/INVOKAMET (canagliflozin) due to share erosion and PROCRIT/ EPREX (epoetin alfa) due to biosimilar competition. The Company updated its policy so that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a location other than the billing location. The policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee 340B covered entities for most of the Company’s drugs, subject to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee covered entities can maintain certain contract pharmacy arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company has been and will continue to offer 340B discounts to covered entities on all of its covered outpatient drugs, and it believes its policy will improve its ability to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited by the 340B statute. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a U.S. federal government program requiring drug manufacturers to provide significant discounts on covered outpatient drugs to covered entities. This policy update had discount implications which positively impacted sales to customers in 2022. 25During 2022, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows:Product Name (Chemical Name)IndicationUS ApprovalEU ApprovalUS FilingEU FilingaprocitentanTreatment for difficult to treat hypertension•CABENUVA (rilpivirine and cabotegravir)HIV treatment for adolescents•CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel)Treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma••ERLEADA (apalutamide)Tablet reduction••IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib)Treatment for Pediatric Patients with Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease•Treatment for Frontline Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (I + V fixed duration) (GLOW)•niraparibTreatment of L1 Prostate cancer metastatic castration-resistant in combination with abiraterone acetate and Prednisone•STELARA (ustekinumab)Treatment of Pediatric Patients with Juvenile Psoriatic Arthritis•TalquetamabTreatment of Patients with Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma•teclistamab(BCMA/CD3)Treatment of Patients with Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma•• 26MedTech Segment**The MedTech segment sales in 2022 were $27.4 billion, an increase of 1.4% from 2021, which included operational growth of 6.2% and a negative currency impact of 4.8%.

The operational growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by the following: Endocutter market recovery and new products partially offset by competitive pressures in the U.S.; Biosurgery market recovery and the success of new products partially offset by strong U.S. market demand in the prior year for infection prevention products; and Energy products driven by market recovery and new product penetration coupled with competitive supply challenges. The operational growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by market recovery and technology penetration.The Orthopaedics franchise sales were $8.6 billion in 2022, which was flat to the prior year. The Orthopaedics franchise included operational sales growth of 3.7% offset by a negative currency impact of 3.7%. The operational growth in hips reflects the market recovery combined with continued strength of the portfolio including the ACTIS stem and enabling technologies – KINCISE and VELYS Hip Navigation. This growth was partially offset by impacts of volume-based procurement in China and the timing of tenders outside the U.S. The operational growth in knees was primarily driven by procedure recovery, strength of the ATTUNE portfolio and pull through related to the VELYS Robotic assisted solution. This growth was partially offset by impacts of volume-based procurement in China and timing of tenders outside the U.S. The operational growth in Trauma was driven by global market recovery and uptake of new products. The operational growth in Spine, Sports & Other was primarily driven by procedure recovery and new product introductions. This growth was partially offset by competitive pressures in Spine and impacts of volume-based procurement in China. The Vision franchise achieved sales of $4.8 billion in 2022, representing an increase of 3.4% from 2021. The Contact Lenses/Other operational growth was due to market recovery, price actions, commercial execution and benefits from new products. Surgical Vision operational growth was primarily due to market recovery and the success of new products and was partially offset by a higher prior year U.S. Refractory market. The Interventional Solutions franchise achieved sales of $4.3 billion in 2022, representing an increase of 8.3% from 2021. Operational growth was driven by market recovery and success of new products and commercial strategies. Interventional solutions also includes sales from Abiomed, Inc. (Abiomed) which were reflected as of December 22, 2022. 27Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on IncomeConsolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was $21.7 billion and $22.8 billion for the years 2022 and 2021, respectively. As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was 22.9% and 24.3%, in 2022 and 2021, respectively.(Dollars in billions. Percentages in chart are as a percent to total sales)Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses:(Dollars in billions.

These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and developmental milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products. Research and Development decreased as a percent to sales primarily driven by:•Lower milestone payments in the Pharmaceutical businessIn-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In the fiscal year 2022, the Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $0.8 billion related to an in-process research and development asset, bermekimab (JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). Additional information regarding efficacy of the AD indication and HS indication became available which led the Company to the decision to terminate the development of bermekimab for both AD and HS. The Company acquired all rights to bermekimab from XBiotech, Inc. in the fiscal year 2020. In fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion primarily related to expected development delays in the general surgery digital robotics platform (Ottava) acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019. The impairment charge was calculated based on revisions to the discounted cash flow valuation model reflecting a delay of first in human procedures of approximately two years from the initial acquisition model assumption of the second half of 2022. The Company will continue to monitor the remaining $1.5 billion Ottava platform intangible asset as development program activities are ongoing. Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), changes in the fair value of securities, investment (income)/loss related to employee benefit programs, gains and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition and divestiture related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income. Other (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2022 was unfavorable by $1.4 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to the following:(Dollars in Billions)(Income)/Expense20222021ChangeConsumer Health separation costs$1.0 0.1 0.9 Litigation related(1)0.9 2.3 (1.4)Changes in the fair value of securities0.7 (0.5)1.2 One-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs0.7 0.0 0.7 Acquisition, Integration and Divestiture related(2)0.1 (0.5)0.6 Restructuring related0.1 0.1 0.0 Employee benefit plan related(1.2)(0.6)(0.6)Other(0.4)(0.4)— Total Other (Income) Expense, Net$1.9 0.5 1.4 (1)2022 was primarily related to pelvic mesh and 2021 was primarily related to talc and Risperdal Gynecomastia (2)2022 was primarily costs related to the acquisition of Abiomed. 2021 was primarily related to divestiture gains of two pharmaceutical brands outside the U.S. 29Interest (Income) Expense: Interest (income) expense in the fiscal of 2022 was net interest income of $214 million as compared to interest expense of $130 million in the fiscal year 2021 primarily due to higher rates of interest earned on cash balances. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $23.5 billion at the end of 2022, and averaged $27.6 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $31.6 billion and $28.4 billion average cash balance in 2021. The total debt balance at the end of 2022 was $39.7 billion with an average debt balance of $36.7 billion as compared to $33.8 billion at the end of 2021 and an average debt balance of $34.5 billion. The lower average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher average debt balance were primarily due to the acquisition of Abiomed in late December of 2022.

(3)Prior year income before tax of approximately $0.2 billion has been reclassified as certain international OTC products, primarily in China, were reclassified from the Pharmaceutical segment to the Consumer Health segment based on operational changes. Consumer Health Segment: In 2022, the Consumer Health segment income before tax as a percent of sales was 19.6% versus 10.5% in 2021. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following:•Lower litigation expense of $0.2 billion in 2022 versus $1.6 billion (primarily talc related) in 2021•Reduction in brand marketing expenses in 2022 versus 2021•Supply chain benefits in 2022partially offset by:•Commodity inflation in 2022 Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2022, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 30.3% versus 34.8% in 2021. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following:•One-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs of $1.5 billion in 2022•Unfavorable changes in the fair value of securities ($0.7 billion loss in 2022 vs. $0.5 billion gain in 2021)•An IPR&D charge of $0.8 billion in 2022 related to bermekimab (JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) •Lower divestiture gains of $0.1 billion in 2022 versus $0.6 billion related to two pharmaceutical brands outside the U.S. in fiscal 2021•Currency impacts in Cost of Products Soldpartially offset by:•Lower litigation related expense of $0.1 billion in 2022 versus $0.6 billion (primarily related to Risperdal Gynecomastia) in 2021•Lower Research & Development milestone payments in 2022•Lower brand marketing expenses in 2022 versus 2021 In fiscal 2020 and 2021, the Company entered into a series of contract manufacturing arrangements for vaccine production with third party contract manufacturing organizations. These arrangements provided the Company with supplemental commercial capacity for vaccine production and potentially transferable rights to such production if capacity is not required. The Company continues to evaluate and monitor both its internal and external supply arrangements. In fiscal 2022, the COVID-19 Vaccine related costs (mentioned above) included the remaining commitments and obligations, including external manufacturing network exit and related inventory costs and required clinical trial expenses, associated with the Company's modification of its 30COVID-19 vaccine research program and manufacturing capacity to levels that meet all remaining customer contractual requirements. MedTech Segment: In 2022, the MedTech segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 16.8% versus 16.2% in 2021. The increase in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily driven by the following:•An IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion in 2021 related to the general surgery offering in digital robotics (Ottava) acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019partially offset by:•Higher litigation related expense of $0.6 billion in 2022, primarily related to pelvic mesh costs versus $0.1 billion in 2021•Acquisition related costs of $0.3 billion in 2022 related to the Abiomed acquisition versus $0.1 billion in 2021 Restructuring: In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its Global Supply Chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Global Supply Chain actions included expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its supply chain network. The Company has achieved approximately $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings as outlined in the restructuring actions. In 2022, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.5 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.3 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $2.2 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. The program was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 17.4% in 2022 and 8.3% in 2021. In the fiscal 2022, the Company incurred approximately $0.5 billion net incremental international tax cost related to the legal separation of the Consumer Health business, and may continue to incur additional cost in fiscal 2023. On December 15, 2022, the European Union (EU) Member States formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. The EU effective dates are January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025, for different aspects of the directive. A significant number of other countries are expected to also implement similar legislation, including South Korea which approved legislation on December 23, 2022 with a full effective date of January 1, 2024. The Company is continuing to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of the Pillar Two Framework, pending legislative adoption by additional individual countries, including those within the European Union. For discussion related to the fiscal 2022 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesLiquidity & Cash FlowsCash and cash equivalents were $14.1 billion at the end of 2022 as compared to $14.5 billion at the end of 2021.

As of January 1, 2023, the net debt position was $16.1 billion as compared to the prior year of $2.1 billion. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Abiomed, Inc. in December 2022. The debt balance at the end of 2022 was $39.7 billion as compared to $33.8 billion in 2021. Considering recent market conditions, the Company has re-evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the Company's remaining balance to be paid on the agreement to settle opioid litigation for approximately $2.7 billion and the establishment of the $2.0 billion trust for talc related liabilities (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. Effective beginning in fiscal 2022, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017 (TCJA) requires the Company to deduct U.S. and international research and development expenditures for tax purposes over 5 to 15 years, instead of in the current fiscal year. As a result, in fiscal 2022, the Company experienced an increase in annual cash tax payments of approximately $1.2 billion above what otherwise would have been remitted to the U.S Treasury. The Company concurrently records a deferred tax benefit for the future amortization of the research and development (R&D) for tax purposes. The requirement to expense R&D as incurred is unchanged for U.S. GAAP purposes and the impact to pre-tax R&D expense is not affected by this provision. On September 14, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's Common Stock. Share repurchases may be made at management’s discretion from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. Any shares acquired will be available 32for general corporate purposes. The Company intends to finance the share repurchase program through available cash. Through January 1, 2023, approximately $2.5 billion has been repurchased under the program.The following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of January 1, 2023: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.

Financing and Market RiskThe Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 1, 2023 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 1, 2023 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $1.7 billion. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on credit support agreements.The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by less than $0.1 billion. The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2022, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $10 billion, which expires on September 7, 2023. In November 2022, the Company secured an additional 364-day revolving Credit Facility of $10 billion, which has an expiration of November 21, 2023. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.Total borrowings at the end of 2022 and 2021 were $39.7 billion and $33.8 billion, respectively. The increase in borrowings was due to the acquisition of Abiomed, Inc. In 2022, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $16.1 billion compared to net debt of $2.1 billion in 2021. Total debt represented 34.1% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2022 and 31.3% of total capital in 2021. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2022 was $29.39 compared to $28.16 at year-end 2021.A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 33DividendsThe Company increased its dividend in 2022 for the 60th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.45 per share in 2022 and $4.19 per share in 2021. On January 3, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.13 per share, payable on March 7, 2023 to shareholders of record as of February 21, 2023. Other InformationCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.Sales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020.Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. Profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2022 and less than 3.0% of the total revenues in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 and are included in sales to customers.In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact. 34Below are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022.Consumer Health Segment(Dollars in Millions)Balance atBeginning of PeriodAccrualsPayments/CreditsBalance atEnd of Period2022 Accrued rebates (1)$287 1,052 (948)391 Accrued returns76 83 (88)71 Accrued promotions387 2,077 (2,008)456 Subtotal$750 3,212 (3,044)918 Reserve for doubtful accounts32 5 (3)34 Reserve for cash discounts15 210 (208)17 Total$797 3,427 (3,255)969 2021 Accrued rebates(1)$289 893 (895)287 Accrued returns76 136 (136)76 Accrued promotions428 1,958 (1,999)387 Subtotal$793 2,987 (3,030)750 Reserve for doubtful accounts39 0 (7)32 Reserve for cash discounts12 213 (210)15 Total$844 3,200 (3,247)797 (1)Includes reserve for customer rebates of $82 million at January 1, 2023 and $80 million at January 2, 2022, recorded as a contra asset.Pharmaceutical Segment(Dollars in Millions)Balance atBeginning of PeriodAccrualsPayments/Credits(2)Balance atEnd of Period2022 Accrued rebates (1)$10,331 43,026 (41,068)12,289 Accrued returns520 444 (315)649 Accrued promotions3 5 (7)1 Subtotal$10,854 43,475 (41,390)12,939 Reserve for doubtful accounts50 0 (6)44 Reserve for cash discounts94 1,281 (1,265)110 Total$10,998 44,756 (42,661)13,093 2021 Accrued rebates (1)$9,837 37,922 (37,428)10,331 Accrued returns460 345 (285)520 Accrued promotions6 13 (16)3 Subtotal$10,303 38,280 (37,729)10,854 Reserve for doubtful accounts52 18 (20)50 Reserve for cash discounts70 1,163 (1,139)94 Total$10,425 39,461 (38,888)10,998 (1)Includes reserve for customer rebates of $203 million at January 1, 2023 and $218 million at January 2, 2022, recorded as a contra asset.

The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.The Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.5 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this cost. See Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. The Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. See Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings. 36Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, healthcare cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates.Stock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units, the fair market value is calculated for the two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.New Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of January 1, 2023. 37Economic and Market FactorsThe Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of healthcare. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2012 - 2022, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for healthcare products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. Beginning in the fiscal second quarter of 2022, the Company accounted for operations in Turkey as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.Russia-Ukraine WarAlthough the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact of the conflict in the fiscal 2022, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was not material. As of both the fiscal years ending January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, the business of the Company’s Ukraine subsidiaries represented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and revenues. As of both the fiscal years ending January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, the business of the Company’s Russian subsidiaries represented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and represented 1% of revenues. In early March, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any additional investment in Russia. Additionally, at the end of March, the Company made the decision to suspend supply of personal care products in Russia. The Company continues to supply its other products as patients rely on many of the products for healthcare purposes.The Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2022 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $0.5 billion and net income by approximately $0.1 billion.Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted. The Company faces various worldwide healthcare changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include healthcare cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions, pricing and reimbursement of healthcare products.Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the U.S. FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. Legal ProceedingsJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, employment, indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 1, 2023, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based 38on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.In the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information regarding legal proceedings.Common Stock The Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ.
