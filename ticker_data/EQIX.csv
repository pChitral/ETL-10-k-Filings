1101239,EQIX,EQUINIX INC,2003,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In many cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “intend” or “continue,” or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview Equinix designs, builds and operates IBX hubs where Internet businesses place their equipment and their network facilities in order to interconnect with each other to improve Internet performance. Our IBX hubs and Internet exchange services enable network service providers, enterprises, content providers, managed service providers and other Internet infrastructure companies to directly connect with each other for increased performance. As of December 31, 2002, we had IBX hubs totaling an aggregate of more than one million gross square feet in the Washington, D.C., New York, Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles, Honolulu and Silicon Valley areas in the United States and in Singapore, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Bangkok and Sydney in the Asia-Pacific region. Recent Developments. In September 2002, we exercised an option we had purchased in May 2002 and reduced our obligation under our San Jose ground lease by approximately one-half. In connection with the exercise of this option, we permitted the landlord to unconditionally draw down on the full $25.0 million in letters of credit that had been posted as security for our San Jose ground lease and had been classified as restricted cash and short-term investments on the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2001. The Company recorded a restructuring charge of $19.0 million and the remaining portion of the letters of credit, representing approximately $6.0 million, was recorded as prepaid rent, representing the fair value of the lease payments for the 15-month period commencing October 1, 2002 to December 31, 2003. The prepaid rent represents the total payments that would have otherwise been paid during this period for the remaining one-half of the lease. The prepaid rent will be amortized ratably over this 15-month period. In October 2002, we entered into agreements to consummate a series of related acquisition and financing transactions. These transactions closed on December 31, 2002. Under the terms of these agreements, we combined our business with two similar businesses, that of i-STT Pte Ltd (“i-STT”) and Pihana Pacific, Inc. (“Pihana”). i-STT’s business is based in Singapore, with operations in Singapore and Thailand. Pihana’s business is based in Hawaii, with operations in Hawaii, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Sydney, Australia. In connection with acquisition of i-STT and Pihana, we issued approximately 3.5 million shares of our common stock and approximately 1.9 million shares of our Series A preferred stock. We refer to this transaction as the “combination”. In conjunction with the combination, we issued to i-STT’s former parent company, STT Communications Ltd. (“STT Communications”), a $30.0 million convertible secured note in exchange for cash. We refer to this transaction as the “financing”. i-STT’s operations are, and are expected to continue to be, essentially break-even from operating activities. Although Pihana’s centers are expected to operate at a loss for approximately 24 months from the closing of the combination, Pihana contributed $33.3 million of cash at closing (approximately $21.7 million, net of working capital), which we believe will be sufficient cash to offset its IBX hubs’ projected loss from operations for this period. In addition, by combining Equinix’s, i-STT’s and Pihana’s businesses, we expect to be able to reduce the annual operating expenses of the combined company by approximately $13.0 million. This will be done through 17 Table of Contents the elimination of duplicate corporate overhead costs, specifically including the closing of Pihana’s corporate headquarters, and a reduction in headcount of the combined companies of nearly 20%, primarily in the general and administrative areas. Furthermore, by using a portion of the cash raised in the transactions to reduce approximately $125.3 million of our debt, we have reduced the annual cash interest expense of the company by approximately $15.8 million. As of December 31, 2002, we had $41.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. We believe that this cash, together with anticipated positive cash flow from operations commencing by the end of 2003 and projected cost-savings in connection with the combination, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, debt service and corporate overhead requirements associated with our operations for the next twelve months. Although we believe we have sufficient cash to reach cash flow break-even from operating, investing and financing activities, we will continue to look for opportunities to raise additional capital to provide the company with greater operating flexibility. In connection with the combination and financing, we amended the terms of the indenture governing our senior notes and extinguished $116.8 million of our senior notes in exchange for a combination of 1.9 million shares of our common stock and $15.2 million of cash. We refer to this transaction as the “senior note exchange”. Because we extinguished the debt in the senior note exchange at a significant discount, we recognized a substantial gain on debt extinguishment during the fourth quarter of 2002. In connection with the combination, financing and the senior note exchange, we amended our credit facility. The most significant terms and conditions of this amendment were: • we were granted a full waiver of previous covenant breaches and were granted consent to use cash in connection with the senior note exchange; • future revenue and EBITDA covenants were eliminated and the remaining minimum cash balance and maximum capital expenditure covenants and other ratios were reset consistent with expected future performance of the combined company for the remaining term of the loan; • we permanently repaid $8.5 million of the then currently outstanding $100.0 million balance, bringing our total amount owed under this facility to $91.5 million as of December 31, 2002; and • the amortization schedule for our credit facility was amended such that the minimum amortization due in 2003-2004 was significantly reduced. Furthermore, in conjunction with the combination, financing, senior note exchange and amendment of our credit facility, on December 31, 2002, we completed a 32 for 1 reverse stock split of our common stock in order to comply with Nasdaq initial listing requirements. Unless otherwise noted, all share and per share amounts in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been adjusted to give effect to the reverse stock split. Risks and Uncertainties. Since inception, we have experienced operating losses and negative cash flow. As of December 31, 2002 we had an accumulated deficit of $351.6 million and accumulated cash used in operating and construction activities of $691.5 million. Given our limited operating history, we may not generate sufficient revenue to achieve desired profitability. We therefore believe that we will continue to experience operating losses for the foreseeable future, particularly from our newly-acquired operations in the Asia-Pacific region. See “Risk Factors”. Under the terms of the amended credit facility, we must meet certain financial and non-financial covenants. While these covenants were reset consistent with our expected future performance as a combined company, if we do not achieve the intended growth required or are unable to reduce costs to a level to comply with these covenants, we may be required to repay the $91.5 million currently outstanding under this facility. Since we do not have sufficient cash reserves to pay this if an event of default occurs, we may be required to renegotiate with the debt issuers for forbearance, make other financial arrangements or take other actions in order to pay down the 18 Table of Contents loan. There can be no assurance that such revised covenants will be met, or that we will be able to obtain a forbearance or that replacement financing will be available. In addition, a default in the credit facility will trigger cross-default provisions in our other debt facilities. If the cash flows from operations are not sufficient to support the Company’s cash requirements, cost reductions implemented as a result of this could adversely affect the business and our ability to achieve our business objectives. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: • Revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts; • Restructuring charges; • Accounting for income taxes; • Contingent liabilities; • Accounting for property and equipment; • Impairment of long-lived assets; and • Consolidation. Revenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We derive our revenues from (a) recurring revenue streams, such as from the leasing of cabinet space, power and interconnection services and bandwidth and (b) non-recurring revenue streams, such as from the recognized portion of deferred installation revenues, professional services and resale of equipment. Revenues from recurring revenue streams are billed monthly and recognized ratably over the term of the contract, generally one to three years. Non-recurring installation fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the related contract. Professional service fees are recognized in the period in which the services were provided and represent the culmination of the earnings process. Fees for the provision of e-business services are recognized progressively as the services are rendered in accordance with the contract terms, except where the future costs cannot be estimated reliably, in which case fees are recognized upon the completion of services. We generally guarantee service levels, such as uptime, as outlined in individual customer contracts. To the extent that these service levels are not achieved, we reduce revenue for any credits given to the customer as a result. The Company has the ability to determine such service level credits prior to the associated revenue being recognized, and historically, these service level credits have not been significant. Revenue is recognized as service is provided and when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured. It is our customary business practice to obtain a signed master sales agreement and sales order prior to recognizing revenue in an arrangement. We assess collection based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the credit-worthiness of the customer. We do not request collateral from our customers. If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured, we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. In addition, we also maintain an 19 Table of Contents allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they become insolvent, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, allowances for doubtful accounts may be required for revenue we had previously expected to collect. Management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes current economic news and trends, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating revenue recognition and the adequacy of our allowances. Our customer base has historically been composed of businesses throughout the U.S. Commencing in fiscal 2003, our revenues will include revenues from our newly-acquired Asia-Pacific operations. We expect that revenues commencing in 2003 will be split approximately 85% in the U.S. and 15% in Asia-Pacific. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers. As of December 31, 2002, one customer, IBM, accounted for 20% of annual revenues and 15% of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2001, one customer, IBM, accounted for 15% of annual revenues and another customer, SiteSmith, accounted for 10% of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2000, two customers, IBM and Loudcloud (now known as Opsware), accounted for 12% and 11% of annual revenues, respectively, and two customers, IBM and UUNET, accounted for 19% and 14% of accounts receivable, respectively. No other single customer accounted for greater than 10% of accounts receivable or annual revenues for the periods presented. During the year ended December 31, 2001, we recognized approximately $200,000 of revenue in relation to equipment received from customers in lieu of cash. This equipment is being used in our operations and was valued based on management’s assessment of the fair value of the equipment in relation to external prices for similar equipment. In February and March 2002, we entered into arrangements with numerous vendors to resell bandwidth, as well as equipment. We began to offer such services in an effort to provide our customers a more fully-integrated services solution. Under the terms of the reseller agreements, we sell the vendors’ services or products to our customers and we will contract with the vendor to provide the related services or products. We recognize revenue from such arrangements on a gross basis in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Abstract No. 99-19, “Recording Revenue as a Principal versus Net as an Agent”. We act as the principal in the transaction as our customer services agreement identifies us as the party responsible for the fulfillment of product/ services to our customers and have full pricing discretion. In the case of products sold under such arrangements, we take title to the products and bear the inventory risk as we have made minimum purchase commitments to various vendors. We have credit risk, as we are responsible for collecting the sales price from a customer, but must pay the amount owed to our suppliers after the suppliers perform, regardless of whether the sales price is fully collected. In addition, we will often determine the required equipment configuration and recommend bandwidth providers from numerous potential suppliers. While we do not anticipate significant future equipment sales, as noted above, we entered into arrangements with numerous vendors to resell equipment in 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we recognized gross revenue of $2.9 million in connection with these reseller agreements as we acted as the primary obligor in these transactions. Restructuring Charges. During the third quarter of 2001 and the second, third and fourth quarters of 2002, we recorded restructuring charges, primarily due to our revised European services strategy and exit costs related to excess leaseholds. These restructuring charges were comprised primarily of write-downs and write-offs of assets and accrued unfavorable lease commitments and related lease exit costs. The amount of the restructuring charges we recorded was based on our estimates of how long it would take to successfully negotiate lease terminations for the leaseholds we desired to exit and the related exit costs. In addition, we may incur additional restructuring charges if, in the future, we decide to modify our Asia-Pacific strategy in one or more of the countries we now operate in within the Asia-Pacific region. Should the actual lease exit costs and other accrued restructuring charges exceed the amount accrued, or a new restructuring activity is identified, additional 20 Table of Contents restructuring charges may be required, which would decrease net income in the period such determination was made. Conversely, if actual lease exit and other restructuring charges are less than the amount accrued, an adjustment to accrued restructuring charges would be required, which would increase income in the period such determination was made. See Recent Accounting Pronouncements for a discussion of “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” Accounting for Income Taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. We currently have provided for a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. We have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. Based on the available objective evidence, management does not believe that the net deferred tax assets will be fully realizable. Should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made. Contingent Liabilities. Management estimates exposure on contingent liabilities, such as litigation, based on the best information available at the time of determination. For litigation claims, when management can reasonably estimate the range of loss and when an unfavorable outcome is probable, a contingent liability is recorded. For current legal proceedings, management believes that it has adequate legal defenses and that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cashflows. Furthermore, because of the uncertainties as to the outcome of these proceedings and since no range of loss can be estimated at this time, management has determined that no accrual is needed. As additional information becomes available, we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position. Accounting for Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are stated at original cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally two to five years for non-IBX hub equipment and seven to ten years for IBX hub equipment. Leasehold improvements and assets acquired under capital lease are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset or improvement. In addition, we have capitalized certain interest costs during the construction phase. Once an IBX hub becomes operational, these capitalized costs are depreciated at the appropriate rate consistent with the estimated useful life of the underlying asset. We have issued numerous warrants to certain fiber carriers and our primary contractor responsible for the construction of many of our IBX hubs. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value these warrants. The value attributed to these warrants are included in our property and equipment and classified as a leasehold improvement. Amortization of such warrants is included in depreciation expense. Should management determine that the actual useful lives of our property and equipment placed into service is less than originally anticipated, or if any of our property and equipment was deemed to have incurred an impairment, additional depreciation, an impairment charge would be required, which would decrease net income in the period such determination was made. Conversely, should management determine that the actual useful lives of its property and equipment placed into service was greater than originally anticipated, less depreciation may be required, which would increase net income in the period such determination was made. 21 Table of Contents Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. We account for the impairment of long-lived assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”, which we adopted in fiscal 2002. We evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived assets, consisting primarily of our IBX hubs, whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances include, but are not limited to, a prolonged industry downturn, a significant decline in our market value, or significant reductions in projected future cash flows. We prepare this analysis by assessing the future net cash flows generated by each IBX hub over their respectful useful lives and comparing this against the carrying value of that IBX hub. Our revenue and cost assumptions used in this analysis are based on numerous factors, including the current revenue and cost performance of each IBX hub, historical growth rates, the remaining space to fill each IBX hub to full capacity relative to the market demand in each of the individual geographic markets of each IBX hub, expected inflation rates and any other available economic indicators and factors that we feel are relevant. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets, we write down such assets based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital. Significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows, including profit margins, long-term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market, groupings of assets, discount rates and terminal growth rates. In addition, significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long-lived assets, including replacement cost, economic obsolescence, and the value that could be realized in orderly liquidation. Changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long-lived assets, thereby requiring us to write down the assets. Our long-lived assets at December 31, 2002, including property and equipment and goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, totaled $389.9 million and $22.9 million, respectively. Consolidation. We follow the provisions of SFAS No. 94, “Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries” and EITF Abstract No. 96-16, “Investor’s Accounting for an Investee When the Investor Has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto Rights”. As a result, all majority-owned subsidiaries are consolidated unless: (1) control is likely to be temporary, or (2) we do not have control. Evidence of such a lack of effective control includes our inability to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting shares, by contract, or otherwise. As a result of the combination, we acquired a 60% interest in i-STT Nation Limited, an IBX hub operation in Thailand. However, as a result of certain substantive participating rights granted to minority shareholders, i-STT Nation Limited is not considered a controlled subsidiary and accordingly, it is not consolidated. Accordingly, we account for i-STT Nation Limited as an equity investment using the equity method of accounting. Under the preliminary purchase price allocation, we attributed no value to this investment as i-STT Nation Limited is in the early stages of operations and is not able to generate positive operating cashflow for the foreseeable future. We are continuing to review our strategic alternatives related to i-STT Nation Limited. Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 Revenues. We recognized revenues of $77.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to revenues of $63.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $65.3 million and $57.6 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, primarily from the leasing of cabinet space, power and cross connects. Non-recurring revenues were $11.9 million and $5.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, primarily related to the recognized portion of deferred installation revenue and custom service revenues and one-time settlement fees associated with certain customer right-sizing or contract terminations. One-time settlement fees recognized during the year ended 22 Table of Contents December 31, 2002 totaled approximately $4.5 million, including a $2.8 million one-time settlement with Qwest received in the third quarter of 2002, and approximately $562,000 for the corresponding period in 2001. Installation and service fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Custom service revenues are recognized upon completion of the services. One-time settlement fees are recognized upon contract termination. In February and March 2002, we entered into equipment reseller agreements with two related party companies. Included within the $11.9 million of non-recurring revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002, were $2.9 million of equipment sales resulting from these two equipment reseller agreements. There were no equipment sales in the year ended December 31, 2001. Excluding equipment sales, we recognized revenues of $74.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to revenues of $63.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, a 17% increase. The period over period growth in revenues was primarily the result of an increase in orders from existing customers and growth in our customer base from 218 customers as of December 31, 2001 to 303 customers as of December 31, 2002 on a pre-merger basis and one-time settlement fees associated with certain customer right-sizing or contract terminations. However, this growth in our customer base is partially offset by a number of our larger customers reducing the size of their contractual commitments to us. We refer to this effort as the “right-sizing” of our larger customer contracts. During the past year, we have proactively worked with certain of our larger customers to right-size their contractual commitments to help them better react to a slowdown in customer demand as a result of weaker economic conditions. Although these right-sizing efforts often result in a reduction in the number of cabinets these customers are obligated to pay for, many of these right-sizing efforts have resulted in the customer extending the term for the remaining cabinets. As a result, although the short-term recurring revenues from such customers are reduced, the overall contract value at times remains intact and the relationship with the customer is preserved, if not improved. As of December 31, 2002, we had successfully completed the right-sizing of most of our customers that had more than 100 cabinets booked, a booking level that represents our larger customers. These right-sizing efforts have, over the past several quarters, been netted out against our new customer cabinet bookings, limiting our overall revenue growth during the past five quarters. Commencing in fiscal 2003, our revenues will include revenues from our newly-acquired Asia-Pacific operations. We expect that revenues commencing in 2003 will be split approximately 85% in the U.S. and 15% in Asia-Pacific. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased to $104.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $94.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. These amounts included $47.8 million and $40.0 million, respectively, of depreciation expense and $266,000 and $426,000, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. In addition to depreciation and stock-based compensation, cost of revenues consists primarily of rental payments for our leased IBX hubs, site employees’ salaries and benefits, utility costs, power and redundancy system engineering support services and related costs and security services. Furthermore, cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 included the costs associated with $2.9 million in equipment sales we recorded, which was approximately $2.8 million. Excluding depreciation, stock-based compensation expense and the costs of equipment sales, cash cost of revenues decreased slightly period over period to $53.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $54.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, a 2% decrease. Cash cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 included $5.0 million in costs related to our European expansion plans. Due to the restructuring charge that we recorded in the third quarter of 2001, these costs were not in our cash cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002; however, these savings were partially offset by the additional costs incurred of $3.7 million from (a) our newest and largest IBX hub opened during the first quarter of 2002 in the New York metropolitan area and (b) the costs associated with the ramp-up of our existing IBX hubs. In September 2002, we exercised an option to reduce the monthly operating costs under the San Jose ground lease by approximately one-half commencing October 2002, which resulted in savings of approximately $1.1 million as compared to the prior year. We anticipate that the costs associated with the continued ramp-up of our IBX hubs and the additional costs associated with some of our new services, such as 23 Table of Contents bandwidth, will continue to increase in the foreseeable future; however, the cost savings resulting from the elimination of approximately half of the San Jose ground lease costs, which commenced in October 2002, should offset most of these increases for the foreseeable future in the U.S. However, commencing in fiscal 2003, our cost of revenues will include the cost of revenues associated with our Asia-Pacific operations. We expect that these additional costs will be substantial and will result in a significant increase in our total cost of revenues. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses decreased to $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. These amounts included $952,000 and $2.8 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. In addition, we recorded $2.3 million in bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to $477,000 recorded in the prior year. This substantial increase in bad debt expense was primarily the result of full provisions against aged receivables associated with two customers, Teleglobe and WorldCom, both of which filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 2002. Excluding stock-based compensation and bad debt expense, cash sales and marketing costs decreased to $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, a 12% decrease. Cash sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses is the result of several cost saving initiatives that we undertook, including staff reductions of approximately 25% during 2001 that resulted in approximately $2.6 million in annual savings in sales and marketing costs and an overall decrease in discretionary spending. We continue to closely monitor our spending in all areas as a result of the current market conditions. However, commencing in fiscal 2003, our sales and marketing expenses will include the sales and marketing expenses associated with our Asia-Pacific operations. We expect that these additional costs will be substantial and result in a significant increase in our sales and marketing expenses. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased to $30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $58.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. These amounts included $5.7 million and $15.8 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense and $6.2 million and $9.6 million, respectively, of depreciation expense, resulting in $14.1 million or 43% decrease in period over period cash spending. Cash general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, accounting, legal and administrative expenses, professional service fees and other general corporate expenses. The significant decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of several cost saving initiatives that we undertook, including staff reductions of approximately 25% during 2001 that resulted in approximately $4.9 million in annual savings in general and administrative costs and an overall decrease in discretionary spending. We continue to closely monitor our spending as a result of the current market conditions. However, commencing in fiscal 2003, our general and administrative expenses will include the general and administrative expenses associated with our Asia-Pacific operations. We expect that these additional costs will be substantial and result in a significant increase in our general and administrative expenses. Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded restructuring charges of $28.9 million. The restructuring charges consisted of (a) a $5.0 million option fee paid in May 2002 related to the amendment of our approximately 80 acre ground lease in San Jose, California from which we subsequently elected to exercise the option to permanently exclude 40 acres commencing October 1, 2002; (b) a write-off of property and equipment of $2.6 million, primarily leasehold improvements and some equipment, located in two unnecessary U.S. IBX expansion and headquarter office space operating leaseholds we had decided to exit and that do not currently provide any ongoing benefit; (c) a write-off of one U.S. letters of credit totaling $250,000 related to one U.S. operating leasehold we had committed to exit; (d) an accrual of $1.0 million related to the remaining estimated European exit costs; (e) an accrual of $925,000 in severance charges related to a less than 10% reduction in workforce in an effort to reduce the cost structure of our corporate headquarter function that will result in approximately $2.8 million in annual savings; (f) an accrual of $115,000 related to additional U.S. leasehold exit costs and (g) a partial write-off of two letters of credit totaling $19.0 million associated with the exercise in September 2002 of our option to permanently terminate approximately one-half of our lease obligations under the San Jose ground lease. 24 Table of Contents During the quarter ended September 30, 2001, the Company took a restructuring charge of $48.6 million consisting of $45.3 million related to a revised European services strategy, $2.0 million for certain anticipated excess U.S. leasehold exit costs and $1.3 million related to a reduction in workforce, primarily in selling, general and administrative functions at the Company’s headquarters. During third quarter 2001, the Company decided to partner with another Internet exchange company in Europe rather than build and operate its own centers outside of the U.S. As a result, the Company i) recorded a write-down of its European construction in progress assets to their net realizable value and recorded a charge totaling $29.3 million, ii) accrued certain leasehold exit costs for its European leasehold interests in the amount of $6.4 million, iii) wrote-off its European letters of credit that secured the European leasehold interests in the amount of $8.6 million and iv) accrued various legal, storage and other costs totaling $1.0 million to facilitate this change in strategy. In addition, the Company incurred a $2.0 million restructuring charge for leasehold exit costs associated with certain excess U.S. leases and a $1.3 million restructuring charge related to an approximate 15% reduction in workforce in an effort to streamline and reduce the cost structure of the Company’s headquarter function. As of December 31, 2002, a total restructuring reserve of $1.7 million remained outstanding for all of the above accrued but unpaid restructuring charges. We began to realize the cost savings benefits resulting from the partial San Jose ground lease termination in cost of revenues during October 2002. Interest Income. Interest income decreased to $998,000 from $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Interest income decreased due to lower cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balances held in interest bearing accounts and lower interest rates received on those invested balances. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $35.1 million from $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in interest expense was attributable to the retirement of $52.8 million of our 13% senior notes during the first half of 2002 and to the decline in both the principal due and the interest rates associated with our credit facility. Gain on Debt Extinguishment. During the first half of 2002, we retired $52.8 million of our senior notes in exchange for approximately 500,000 shares of our common stock and approximately $2.5 million of cash. On December 31, 2002, we retired an additional $116.8 million of our senior notes in exchange for approximately 1.9 million shares of our common stock and approximately $15.2 million of cash. As a result of these transactions, we recognized a $114.2 million net gain on debt extinguishment during 2002, after deducting transaction costs, interest waived and allocation of unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discount. Years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 Revenues. Revenues increased from $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $63.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Revenues consist of recurring revenues of $57.6 million for 2001, versus $11.6 million for 2000, primarily from the leasing of cabinet space, and non-recurring revenues of $5.8 million for 2001, versus $1.4 million for 2000, related to the recognized portion of deferred installation revenue and custom service revenues. Installation fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Custom service revenues are recognized upon completion of the services. Revenues increased year over year because we had more IBX hubs open and operational during 2001 than we had during 2000. We expect revenues to continue to increase as our customer base continues to grow and as a result of opening our newest and largest IBX hub in the New York metropolitan area during the first quarter of 2002. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased from $43.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $94.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. These amounts include depreciation and amortization expense of $11.5 million and $40.0 million, respectively. In addition to depreciation and amortization, cost of revenues consists primarily of rental payments for our leased IBX hubs, site employees’ salaries and benefits, utility costs, power and redundancy system engineering support services and related costs and security services. 25 Table of Contents The increase in cost of revenues was due to additional leases and increased expenses related to our opening of additional IBX hubs. During the quarter ended September 30, 2001, we revised our European services strategy that included exiting our European leases and various U.S. leaseholds. These actions reduced the cost of revenues commencing in fourth quarter 2001; however, these savings have been offset in part by increased cost of revenues associated with the opening of the New York metropolitan IBX hub during the first quarter of 2002, including related depreciation and amortization expense, and additional cost of revenues related to our existing IBX hubs as our installed base of customers grows. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses decreased from $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001; however, these amounts include stock-based compensation expense of $6.3 million and $2.8 million, respectively, resulting in a 2% increase in period over period cash spending. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for the sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel. The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted from the addition of personnel in our sales and marketing organizations during the first half of 2001, reflecting our increased selling effort and our initiatives to develop market awareness. During the quarter ended September 30, 2001, we incurred a $1.3 million restructuring charge related to a reduction in workforce that included some sales and marketing staff. In addition, we are closely monitoring our discretionary marketing costs as the result of current market conditions. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased from $56.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $58.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. These amounts include stock-based compensation expense of $22.8 million and $15.8 million, respectively, and depreciation and amortization expense of $3.3 million and $9.6 million, respectively, resulting in an 8% increase in period over period cash spending. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, accounting, legal and administrative expenses, professional service fees and other general corporate expenses. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of increased expenses associated with additional hiring of personnel in management, finance and administration, as well as other related costs associated with supporting our expansion, particularly during the first quarter of 2001. During the second and third quarters of 2001, we implemented several cost-savings initiatives, including some staff reductions and an overall decrease in discretionary spending. Restructuring Charge. During the quarter ended September 30, 2001, we took a restructuring charge of $48.6 million consisting of $45.3 million related to its revised European services strategy, $2.0 million for certain anticipated excess U.S. leasehold exit costs and $1.3 million related to a reduction in workforce, primarily in selling, general and administrative functions at our corporate headquarters. During third quarter 2001, we decided to partner with other Internet exchange companies in Europe rather than build and operate our own centers outside of the U.S. As a result, we (a) recorded a write-down of our European construction in progress assets to their net realizable value and recorded a charge totaling $29.3 million, (b) accrued certain leasehold exit costs for our European leasehold interests in the amount of $6.4 million, (c) wrote-off our European letters of credit that secured the European leasehold interests in the amount of $8.6 million and (d) accrued various legal, storage and other costs totaling $1.0 million to facilitate this change in strategy. We experienced some cost savings benefits from this restructuring charge during the fourth quarter of 2001, particularly in cost of revenues; however, these cost-savings were partially offset by the increased operating costs of the New York metropolitan area IBX hub beginning in the first quarter of 2002. In addition, we incurred a $2.0 million restructuring charge for leasehold exit costs associated with certain excess U.S. leases and a $1.3 million restructuring charge related to an approximate 15% reduction in workforce in an effort to reduce the cost structure of our corporate headquarter functions. We began to realize the cost savings benefits of the $2.0 million U.S. lease restructuring charge and $1.3 million workforce reduction restructuring charge commencing in the fourth quarter of 2001. Interest Income. Interest income decreased from $16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as a result of a decline in short-term interest rates and reduced cash, cash equivalent and short-term investments. 26 Table of Contents Interest Expense. Interest expense increased from $29.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase in interest expense was attributed to interest related to an increase in our debt facilities and capital lease obligations, including the credit facility, and amortization of the credit facility and other debt facilities and capital lease obligations debt issuance costs and discounts. Liquidity and Capital Resources Since inception, we have financed our operations and capital requirements primarily through the issuance of senior notes, the private sale of preferred stock, our initial public offering, our credit facility, which was later amended, our convertible secured notes, our combination with i-STT and Pihana and various types of debt facilities and capital lease obligations, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $909.2 million. As of December 31, 2001, our total indebtedness from senior notes, our credit facility and other debt facilities and capital lease obligations was $319.2 million. As of December 31, 2002, this amount was reduced to $161.6 million, including our $30.0 million convertible secured notes issued in December 2002 that do not require cash interest payments. As of December 31, 2002, our principal source of liquidity was approximately $41.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. Uses of Cash Net cash used in our operating activities was $27.5 million, $68.9 million and $68.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. We used cash primarily to fund our net loss, including cash interest payments on senior notes and our credit facility. Net cash used in investing activities was $7.5 million, $153.0 million and $302.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to the construction of our IBX hubs and the purchase of restricted cash and short-term investments. The amount of cash used in investing activities has decreased substantially as we have now completed our IBX hub rollout plan. Net cash generated by financing activities was $16.9 million, $107.8 million and $339.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net cash generated by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2002 was primarily attributable to the cash acquired in the acquisitions of i-STT and Pihana and proceeds from our $30.0 million convertible secured notes, offset by payments of $17.7 million used to retire approximately $169.5 million of our senior notes and the costs associated with the exchange of the senior notes and repayments under our credit facility of $13.5 million. Net cash generated by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2001 was primarily attributable to the net $105.0 million draw down under our credit facility. Net cash generated by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2000 was primarily attributable to the proceeds from the initial public offering of our common stock and the issuance of Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock. 27 Table of Contents Debt Obligations As of December 31, 2002, our total indebtedness from our senior notes, credit facility, convertible secured notes and debt facilities and capital lease obligations was $161.6 million, as follows: Senior Notes. In December 1999, we issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 13% senior notes. Our aggregate net proceeds of this offering were $193.4 million, net of offering expenses. During the first half of 2002, we retired $52.8 million of the senior notes in exchange for approximately 500,000 shares of common stock and approximately $2.5 million of cash. On December 31, 2002, we retired an additional $116.8 million of the senior notes in exchange for approximately 1.9 million shares of our common stock and approximately $15.2 million of cash. As of December 31, 2002, a total of $30.5 million of senior note principal remains outstanding. Credit Facility. In December 2000, we entered into the credit facility with a syndicate of lenders under which, subject to our compliance with a number of financial ratios and covenants, we were permitted to borrow up to $150.0 million. As of September 30, 2001, we had borrowed the entire $150.0 million under this facility. In October 2001, in conjunction with the repayment of $50.0 million, we amended the credit facility to decrease total borrowing allowed to $125.0 million and to reset certain financial covenants to more accurately reflect market conditions. As of September 30, 2002, a total of $100.0 million was outstanding under the credit facility. The credit facility required us to maintain specific financial ratios and comply with quarterly, and in some circumstances, monthly covenants requiring us to, among other things, achieve specific revenue targets at levels significantly above historical revenues, maintain certain minimum cash balances and limit our EBITDA losses. As of September 30, 2002, we were not in compliance with several of these provisions, including the revenue covenant. In August and November 2002, the senior lenders provided us with various waivers and further amended the credit facility. Under the August 2002 amendment, we agreed to prepay $5.0 million and agreed to a reduction in the total borrowing allowed under the credit facility to $100.0 million (permanently eliminating the $20.0 million which was previously available for borrowing). The November 2002 amendment primarily provided the company with some additional time and flexibility in order to complete the senior note exchange. In connection with the combination, financing and completed senior note exchange, we entered into a further amendment to the credit facility. The most significant terms and conditions of this amendment were: • we were granted a full waiver of previous covenant breaches and were granted consent to use cash to retire our senior notes in connection with the senior note exchange; • future revenue and EBITDA covenants were eliminated and the remaining covenants and ratios were reset consistent with expected future performance of the combined company for the remaining term of the loan; • we permanently repaid $8.5 million of the then currently outstanding $100.0 million balance, bringing our total amount owed under this facility to $91.5 million as of December 31, 2002; and • the amortization schedule for the credit facility was amended such that the minimum amortization due in 2003–2004 was significantly reduced. Convertible Secured Note. In December 2002, in conjunction with the combination, STT Communications made a $30.0 million strategic investment in the company in the form of a 14% convertible secured note with an initial term of five years. The interest on the convertible secured note is payable in kind in the form of additional convertible secured notes. Other Debt Facilities and Capital Lease Obligations. In May 1999, we entered into a master lease agreement with Comdisco in the amount of $1.0 million. This master lease agreement was increased by addendum in August 1999 by $5.0 million. This agreement bears interest at either 7.5% or 8.5% and is repayable over 42 months in equal monthly payments with a final interest payment equal to 15% of the advance amounts due on maturity. As of December 31, 2002, these capital lease financings were fully drawn and $1.9 million remained outstanding. 28 Table of Contents In August 1999, we entered into a loan agreement with Venture Lending and Leasing in the amount of $10.0 million and fully drew down on this amount. This loan agreement bears interest at 8.5% and was repayable over 42 months in equal monthly payments with a final interest payment equal to 15% of the advance amounts due on maturity. In October 2002, we amended the loan agreement to secure certain short-term cash deferment benefits. Under the terms of this amendment, we extended the maturity of the loan by 24 months and amortized the remaining principal balance and related balloon interest payment over this amended period ending March 1, 2005; and in exchange, the Company issued new warrants and re-priced their original warrants. As of December 31, 2002, principal of $1.3 million remained outstanding. In March 2001, we entered into a loan agreement with Wells Fargo in the amount of $3.0 million and fully drew down on this amount. This loan agreement bears interest at 13.15% and is repayable over 36 months. As of June 30, 2002, we were not in compliance with one of the requirements of this loan. As a result, we have reflected the full amount outstanding under this facility totaling $1.6 million as a current obligation on the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2002. In January 2003, we reached an agreement with Wells Fargo and made a payment to Wells Fargo of approximately $1.7 million in full satisfaction of all amounts owed to Wells Fargo under the loan agreement. In June 2001, we entered into a loan agreement with Heller Financial Leasing in the amount of $5.0 million and fully drew down on this amount. This loan agreement bears interest at 13.0% and is repayable over 36 months. In August 2002, we amended this loan to secure certain short-term cash deferment. Under the amended terms of this loan agreement, we extended the maturity of the loan by nine months. Commencing September 2002, we began to benefit from the reduction in monthly payments over the following 14 months thereby deferring approximately $1.2 million of principal payments. Commencing November 2003, the deferred principal payments will be repaid over the remaining 17 months of the loan ending March 2005. As of December 31, 2002, principal of $3.3 million remained outstanding. In December 2002, in conjunction with our merger with Pihana, we acquired multiple capital leases with Orix. The original amount financed was approximately $3.5 million. These capital lease arrangements bear interest at an average rate of 6.4% per annum and are repayable over 30 months. As of December 31, 2002, principal of $1.5 million remained outstanding. Debt Maturities and Operating Lease Commitments We lease our IBX hubs and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating lease agreements expiring through 2020. The following represents the minimum future operating lease payments for these commitments, as well as the combined aggregate maturities for all of our debt as of December 31, 2002 (in thousands): Debt facilities & capital lease obligations Credit facility Senior notes Convertible secured notes Operating leases Total 2003 $ 5,852 $ 1,981 $ — $ — $ 20,913 $ 28,746 2004 3,019 6,981 — — 23,075 33,075 2005 729 82,548 — — 26,134 109,411 2006 — — — — 27,189 27,189 2007 — — 30,475 30,000 28,050 88,525 2008 and thereafter — — — — 206,840 206,840 $ 9,600 $ 91,510 $ 30,475 $ 30,000 $ 332,201 $ 493,786 We believe that our cash on hand, together with anticipated positive cash flow from operations commencing by the end of 2003 and projected cost-savings in connection with the combination, will be sufficient to meet our working capital, debt service and corporate overhead requirements associated with our operations for the next twelve months. Although we believe we have sufficient cash to reach cash flow break-even from operating, investing and financing activities, we will continue to look for opportunities to raise additional capital to provide the company with greater operating flexibility. 29 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business and us: Risks Related to Our Business Equinix, i-STT and Pihana have limited operating histories and the market for each company’s services is still in its early stages. We were founded in June 1998 and did not recognize any revenue until November 1999. i-STT was founded in January 2000 and did not recognize any revenue until May 2000. Pihana was founded in June 1999 and did not recognize any revenue until June 2000. We expect that we will encounter challenges and difficulties frequently experienced by early-stage companies in new and rapidly evolving international markets, such as our ability to generate cash flow, hire, train and retain sufficient operational and technical talent, and implement our plan with minimal delays. We may not successfully address any or all of these challenges and our failure to do so would seriously harm our business plan and operating results, and affect our ability to raise additional funds. If we are unable to meet these challenges and generate higher revenues while reducing costs, we may not be able to comply with the covenants in the credit facility. If we breach our credit facility, the banks could require repayment of all amounts previously drawn down and we will not have sufficient cash reserves to repay such amounts. Equinix, i-STT and Pihana have each incurred substantial losses in the past, may continue to incur additional losses in the future and will not be profitable until the combined company reverses this trend. Equinix incurred losses of approximately $21.6 million for 2002 ($135.8 million, excluding the gain on debt extinguishment), i-STT incurred losses of approximately $8.0 million for 2002 and Pihana incurred losses of approximately $148.5 million for the same period. In recent periods, Equinix, i-STT and Pihana have not generated cash from operations. Even if the combined company achieves profitability, given the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which it operates, the combined company may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. The combination will delay, and may prevent, our profitability as a result of factors including: • significant operating losses and lower gross margins generated by Pihana’s IBX hubs; • costs associated with integrating the three businesses; and • fees and costs associated with completing these transactions, including professional fees. As a result of these increased expenses, the combined company will need to increase revenues in order to reach profitability. If we are unable to sufficiently grow revenues while reducing costs, we may not be able to comply with the covenants in our credit facility. If we breach the credit facility, the banks could require repayment of all amounts previously drawn down and we do not have sufficient cash reserves to repay such amounts. We expect our operating results to fluctuate. Equinix, i-STT and Pihana have each experienced fluctuations in their respective results of operations on a quarterly and annual basis. The fluctuation in their operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We expect to experience significant fluctuations in our operating results in the foreseeable future due to a variety of factors, including: • changes in general economic conditions and specific market conditions in the telecommunications and Internet industries; 30 Table of Contents • growth or decline of Internet use; • customer insolvency; • the ability of our customers to obtain financing or to fund their capital expenditures; • demand for space and services at our IBX hubs; • our pricing policies and the pricing policies of our competitors; • the timing of customer installations and related payments; • customer retention and satisfaction; • the provision of customer discounts and credits; • the mix of current and proposed products and services and the gross margins associated with our products and services; • competition in the markets; • conditions related to international operations; • the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures and expenses related to the expansion of sales, marketing, operations and acquisitions, if any, of complementary businesses and assets; • the cost and availability of adequate public utilities, including power; • ability to obtain, transfer, or maintain licenses required by governmental entities with respect to the combined business; and • compliance with governmental regulation with which we have little experience. • the effects of terrorist activity and armed conflict, such as disruptions in general economic activity, changes in logistics and security arrangements, and reduced customer demand for our services; Any of the foregoing factors, or other factors discussed elsewhere in this report, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Although Equinix, i-STT and Pihana have experienced growth in revenues in recent quarters, this growth rate is not necessarily indicative of future operating results. It is possible that the combined company may never achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. In addition, a relatively large portion of our expenses are fixed in the short-term, particularly with respect to lease and personnel expenses, depreciation and amortization, and interest expenses. Therefore, our results of operations are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenues. As such, comparisons to prior reporting periods should not be relied upon as indications of the combined company’s future performance. In addition, our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, we could experience an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of its stock. If we cannot generate higher revenues, while reducing costs by combining the businesses, we may not be able to comply with the covenants in the credit facility. If the combined company breaches the credit facility, the banks could require repayment of all amounts previously drawn and the combined company will not have sufficient cash reserves to repay such amounts. If we cannot successfully integrate Pihana’s and i-STT’s respective existing business operations, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the combination. Integrating i-STT and Pihana into our business operations involves a number of risks, including: • the difficulties and expenses in combining the operations, technology and computer systems and software applications of the three companies; 31 Table of Contents • the different geographic locations of the principal operations of us, i-STT and Pihana; • the difficulties in integrating the companies’ key revenue-generating services in a way that would be accepted in the market; • the difficulties in the creation and maintenance of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; • the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing operations; • the challenges in keeping and attracting customers; and • the introduction of new or enhanced services. If we are to realize the anticipated benefits of the combination, our operations must be efficiently and effectively integrated with the operation of i-STT and Pihana. There can be no assurance that the integration will be successful or that the anticipated benefits of the combination will be realized. If we cannot generate higher revenues, while reducing costs, we may not be able to comply with the covenants in our credit facility. If we breach the credit facility, the banks could require repayment of all amounts previously drawn down and we do not have sufficient cash reserves to repay such amounts. If we cannot effectively integrate and manage international operations, our revenues may not increase and our business and results of operations would be harmed. In 2002, our sales outside North America represented less than 1% of our revenues, i-STT’s sales outside North America represented approximately 100% of its revenues and Pihana’s sales outside North America represented approximately 45% of its revenues. We anticipate that, for the foreseeable future, approximately 15% of the combined company’s revenues will be derived from sources outside North America. Our management team is comprised primarily of Equinix executives before the combination, some of whom have had limited or no experience overseeing international operations. To date, the neutrality of the Equinix IBX hubs and the variety of networks available to our customers has often been a competitive advantage for us. In certain of our recently acquired IBX hubs, in Singapore in particular, the limited number of carriers available diminishes that advantage. As a result, we may need to adapt our key revenue-generating services and pricing to be competitive in that market. We may experience gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, for which hedging activities may not adequately protect us. Where our prices are denominated in U.S. dollars, our sales could be adversely affected by declines in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, thereby making our products more expensive in local currencies. Our international operations are generally subject to a number of additional risks, including: • costs of customizing IBX hubs for foreign countries; • protectionist laws and business practices favoring local competition; • greater difficulty or delay in accounts receivable collection; • difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; • political and economic instability; • ability to obtain, transfer, or maintain licenses required by governmental entities with respect to the combined business; and • compliance with governmental regulation with which we have little experience. To date, the majority of Equinix’s revenues and costs have been denominated in U.S. dollars; the majority of i-STT’s revenues and costs have been denominated in Singapore dollars and the majority of Pihana’s revenues and costs have been denominated in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen and Australian and Singapore dollars. However, 32 Table of Contents we expect that in the future an increasing portion of revenues and costs will be denominated in foreign currencies. Although the combined company may undertake foreign exchange hedging transactions to reduce foreign currency transaction exposure, it does not currently intend to eliminate all foreign currency transaction exposure. STT Communications holds a substantial portion of our stock and has significant influence over matters requiring stockholder consent. STT Communications currently owns approximately 28% of our outstanding voting stock. Because of the diffuse ownership of our stock, STT Communications has significant influence over matters requiring our stockholder approval. Following the expiration of restrictions on STT Communications preventing it from converting its convertible secured notes and warrants into voting stock if, as a result, STT Communications will own more than 40% of our voting stock, STT Communications will effectively control the company and the election of directors to our board of directors. Consequently, STT Communications will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, which could prevent or delay a third party from acquiring or merging with us. We need to improve and implement financial and managerial controls and improve our reporting systems and procedures. If we are unable to do so successfully, we may not be able to manage growth effectively and our operating results would be harmed. In order to manage the integration of the i-STT and Pihana businesses, we need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures. Any inability of our management to integrate additional companies, employees, technology advances and customer service into operations and to eliminate unnecessary duplication may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be forced to take steps, and may be prevented from pursuing certain business opportunities, to ensure compliance with certain tax-related covenants agreed to by us in the combination agreement. We agreed to a covenant in the combination agreement (which we refer to as the FIRPTA covenant) that we would use all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that at all times from and after the closing of the combination until such time as neither STT Communications nor its affiliates hold our capital stock or debt securities (or the capital stock received upon conversion of the debt securities) received by STT Communications in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the combination agreement, none of our capital stock issued to STT Communications constitute “United States real property interests” within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which we call the Code. Under Section 897(c) of the Code, our capital stock issued to STT Communications would generally constitute “United States real property interests” at such point in time that the fair market value of the “United States real property interests” owned by us equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the aggregate fair market values of (a) our “United States real property interests,” (b) our interests in real property located outside the U.S., and (c) any other assets held by us which are used or held for use in our trade or business. Given that we currently own significant amounts of “United States real property interests,” we may be limited with respect to the business opportunities we may pursue, particularly if the business opportunities would increase the amounts of “United States real property interests” owned by us or decrease the amount of other assets owned by us. In addition, pursuant to the FIRPTA covenant we may be forced to take commercially reasonable proactive steps to ensure our compliance with the FIRPTA covenant, including, but not limited to, (a) a sale-leaseback transaction with respect to all real property interests, or (b) the formation of a holding company organized under the laws of the Republic of Singapore which would issue shares of its capital stock in exchange for all of our outstanding stock (this reorganization would require the submission of that transaction to our stockholders for their approval and the consummation of that exchange). 33 Table of Contents Our non-U.S. customers include numerous related parties of i-STT. In the past, a substantial portion of i-STT’s financing, as well as its revenues, has been derived from its affiliates. We continue to have contractual and other business relationships and may engage in material transactions with affiliates of STT Communications. Circumstances may arise in which the interests of STT Communications’ affiliates may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. In addition, Singapore Technologies Pte Ltd, an affiliate of STT Communications, makes investments in various companies; it has invested in the past, and may invest in the future, in entities that compete with us. In the context of negotiating commercial arrangements with affiliates, conflicts of interest have arisen in the past and may arise, in this or other contexts, in the future. There can be no assurance that any conflicts of interest will be resolved in our favor. Our success is dependent on the retention of our executive officers and key employees. We are substantially dependent upon the continued service of our executive officers. In addition, we are dependent on the retention of key employees of Pihana and i-STT who have knowledge of the applicable local business environment and data center operations. Without these individuals as part of the management team, it would be significantly more difficult to efficiently and effectively integrate our critical functions and compete effectively against other Internet infrastructure companies. We have significant debt and we may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations. Our total debt consists primarily of the following: • a total of $30.5 million principal amount of senior notes; • a total of $91.5 million principal amount of loans under our credit facility; • a total of $30.0 million of a newly issued convertible secured note; and • approximately $9.6 million of other outstanding debt facilities and capital lease obligations. Under the terms of the combination agreement, we are contractually obligated to use our reasonable best efforts to obtain the release of STT Communications from a bank guarantee associated with i-STT’s unconsolidated Thailand joint venture. Such efforts may include i-STT assuming such guarantee if it is commercially reasonable to do so. Currently, we have not assumed such guarantee and accordingly, no liability has been recorded for this potential liability as of December 31, 2002. This guarantee is for a Thai baht 260,000,000 bank loan (approximately $6,032,000 as translated using effective exchange rates at December 31, 2002), of which Thai baht 54,900,000 is currently outstanding as of December 31, 2002 (approximately $1,274,000 as translated using effective exchange rates at December 31, 2002). The amount of our debt could have important consequences, including: • impairing our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes; • requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our operating cash flow to paying principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for operations; • limiting our ability to grow and make capital expenditures due to the financial covenants contained in our debt arrangements; • impairing our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions, invest in new or developing technologies, or take advantage of significant business opportunities that may arise; and • making us more vulnerable if a general economic downturn continues or if its businesses experience difficulties. 34 Table of Contents If we cannot generate sufficient additional revenue and recognize sufficient synergy savings by combining the businesses, we may not be able to meet our debt service obligations or repay our debt when due or comply with other covenants in the credit facility. If we breach the credit facility, the banks could require repayment of all amounts previously drawn down, and we do not have sufficient cash reserves to repay such amounts. We may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repay or refinance our indebtedness. We are obligated to make principal and/or interest payments on our credit facility each year until up to 2006 and on our senior notes each year until 2007. Additionally, our credit facility matures in 2006 and the convertible secured notes and our senior notes mature in 2007. Each of these obligations require significant amounts of liquidity. We may need additional capital to fund those obligations. Our ability to arrange financing and the cost of this financing will depend upon many factors, including: • general economic and capital markets conditions generally, and in particular the non-investment grade debt market; • conditions in the Internet infrastructure market; • credit availability from banks or other lenders; • investor confidence in the telecommunications industry generally and our company specifically; • the success of our IBX hubs; and • provisions of tax and securities laws that are conducive to raising capital. If we need additional funds, our inability to raise them will have an adverse effect on our operations. If we decide to raise additional funds by incurring debt, we may become subject to additional or more restrictive financial covenants and ratios. We are subject to restrictive covenants under the credit facility that limit our flexibility in managing our business. Our credit facility requires that the combined company maintain specific financial ratios and comply with covenants, including a monthly cash covenant, and contains numerous restrictions on our ability to incur debt, pay dividends or make other restricted payments, sell assets, enter into affiliate transactions and take other actions. Furthermore, our existing financial arrangements are, and future financing arrangements are likely to be, secured by substantially all of our assets. If we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any of these covenants, a default could result under one or more of these agreements. A default, if not waived by our lenders, could result in the acceleration of outstanding indebtedness and cause our debt to become immediately due and payable. If an acceleration occurs, we will not be able to repay our debt, and it is unlikely that we will be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance our debt. Even if new financing is made available to us, it may not be available on terms acceptable to us. A significant number of shares of our capital stock issued in connection with the combination, the financing and the senior note exchange may be sold in the market in the near future. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well. We issued a large number of shares of our capital stock to the former Pihana stockholders, STT Communications, and holders of our senior notes in connection with the combination, financing and senior note exchange. The shares of common stock issued in the senior note exchange may be sold into the public market immediately following the closing of the exchange. The shares of common stock issued in connection with the combination will be registered for resale within six months. Subject to the restrictions described in this proxy statement, the senior notes and warrants issued in connection with the financing are immediately convertible or exercisable into shares of common stock and the underlying shares of common stock may be registered for resale 35 Table of Contents within six months of the closing. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by these parties within any narrow period of time could cause our stock price to fall. In addition, the issuance of the additional shares of our common stock as a result of these transactions will reduce our earnings per share, if any. This dilution could reduce the market price of our common stock unless and until we achieve revenue growth or cost savings and other business economies sufficient to offset the effect of this issuance. There can be no assurance that we will achieve revenue growth, cost savings or other business economies. Our profitability is affected by the average selling price of our services and our operations efficiency rates. Decreases in the average selling prices of our, i-STT’s, and Pihana’s services have had and will continue to have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Historically, the average per square foot selling price of our, i-STT’s and Pihana’s services have declined since the commencement of their respective operations. Our ability to achieve profitability will continue to be dependent, in large part, upon our ability to offset any decreases in average per square foot selling prices by improving operations efficiency, and increasing the value added services provided at our IBX hubs. If we are unable to do so, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We resell products and services of third parties that may require us to pay for such services even if our customers fail to pay us for the services which may have a negative impact on our operating results. In order to provide resale services such as bandwidth, managed services, backup and recovery services and other network management services, we will contract with third party service providers. These services require us to enter into fixed term contracts for services with third party suppliers of products and services. If we experience the loss of a customer who has purchased a resale product, we will remain obligated to continue paying monies to our suppliers for the term of the underlying contracts. The payment of these obligations without a corresponding payment from customers will reduce our financial resources and may have a material adverse affect on our financial performance and operating results. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Our IBX hubs and other products and services must be able to differentiate themselves from existing providers of space and services for telecommunications companies, web hosting companies and other colocation providers. In addition to competing with neutral colocation providers, we must compete with traditional colocation providers, including local phone companies, long distance phone companies, Internet service providers and web hosting facilities. Likewise, with respect to our other products and services, including managed services, bandwidth services and security services, we must compete with more established providers of similar services. Most of these companies have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than us. Because of their greater financial resources, some of these companies have the ability to adopt aggressive pricing policies. As a result, in the future, we may suffer from pricing pressure that would adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, these competitors could offer colocation on neutral terms, and may start doing so in the same metropolitan areas where we have IBX hubs. Some of these competitors may also provide our target customers with additional benefits, including bundled communication services, and may do so in a manner that is more attractive to our potential customers than obtaining space in our IBX hubs. We believe our neutrality provides us with an advantage over these competitors. However, if these competitors were able to adopt aggressive pricing policies together with offering colocation space, our ability to generate revenues would be materially adversely affected. We may also face competition from persons seeking to replicate our IBX concept. Competitors may operate more successfully or form alliances to acquire significant market share. Furthermore, enterprises that have already invested substantial resources in peering arrangements may be reluctant or slow to adopt our approach 36 Table of Contents that may replace, limit or compete with their existing systems. In addition, other companies may be able to attract the same potential customers that we are targeting. Once customers are located in competitors’ facilities, it will be extremely difficult to convince them to relocate to our IBX hubs. Because we depend on the development and growth of a balanced customer base, failure to attract and retain this base of customers could harm our business and operating results. Our ability to maximize revenues depends on our ability to develop and grow a balanced customer base, consisting of a variety of companies, including network service providers, site and performance management companies, and enterprise and content companies. The more balanced the customer base within each IBX hub, the better we will be able to generate significant interconnection revenues, which in turn increases our overall revenues. Our ability to attract customers to our IBX hubs will depend on a variety of factors, including the presence of multiple carriers, the mix of products and services offered by us, the overall mix of customers, the IBX hub’s operating reliability and security and our ability to effectively market our services. In addition, some of our customers are and will continue to be Internet companies that face many competitive pressures and that may not ultimately be successful. If these customers do not succeed, they will not continue to use the IBX hubs. This may be disruptive to our business and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our products and services have a long sales cycle that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A customer’s decision to license cabinet space in the IBX hubs and to purchase additional services typically involves a significant commitment of resources and will be influenced by, among other things, the customer’s confidence in our financial strength. In addition, some customers will be reluctant to commit to locating in our IBX hubs until they are confident that the IBX hub has adequate carrier connections. As a result, we have a long sales cycle. Delays due to the length our sales cycle may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We depend on a number of third parties to provide Internet connectivity to our IBX hubs; if connectivity is interrupted or terminated, our operating results and cash flow will be materially adversely affected. The presence of diverse telecommunications carriers’ fiber networks to our IBX hubs is critical to our ability to attract new customers. We believe that the availability of carrier capacity will directly affect our ability to achieve our projected results. We are not a telecommunications carrier, and as such we rely on third parties to provide our customers with carrier services. We rely primarily on revenue opportunities from their customers to encourage carriers to invest the capital and operating resources required to build facilities from their locations to our IBX hubs. Carriers will likely evaluate the revenue opportunity of an IBX hub based on the assumption that the environment will be highly competitive. There can be no assurance that any carrier will elect to offer its services within our IBX hubs. In addition, there can be no assurance once a carrier has decided to provide Internet connectivity to our IBX hubs that it will continue to do so for any period of time. The construction required to connect multiple carrier facilities to our IBX hubs is complex and involves factors outside of our control, including regulatory processes and the availability of construction resources. If the establishment of highly diverse Internet connectivity to our IBX hubs does not occur or is materially delayed or is discontinued, our operating results and cash flow will be adversely affected. Further, many carriers are experiencing business difficulties. As a result, some carriers may be forced to terminate connectivity within our IBX hubs. We have service level commitment obligations to certain of our customers. As a result, service interruptions or significant equipment damage in our IBX hubs, whether or not within our control, could result in service level 37 Table of Contents commitments to these customers. Our liability insurance may not be adequate to cover those expenses. In addition, any loss of services, equipment damage or inability to meet our service level commitment obligations, particularly in the early stage of our development, could reduce the confidence of our customers and could consequently impair our ability to obtain and retain customers, which would adversely affect both our ability to generate revenues and our operating results. Any failure of our physical infrastructure or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce our revenue and harm our business reputation and financial results. Our business depends on providing customers with highly reliable service. We must protect customers’ IBX infrastructure and customers’ equipment located in our IBX hubs. The services we provide are subject to failure resulting from numerous factors, including: • human error; • physical or electronic security breaches; • fire, earthquake, flood and other natural disasters; • water damage; • power loss; • sabotage and vandalism; and • failure of business partners who provide the combined company’s resale products. Problems at one or more of our IBX hubs, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions or significant equipment damage. In the past, a limited number of our customers have experienced temporary losses of power and failure of our services levels on products such as bandwidth connectivity. If we incur significant financial commitments to our customers in connection with a loss of power, or our failure to meet other service level commitment obligations, our liability insurance may not be adequate to cover those expenses. In addition, any loss of services, equipment damage or inability to meet our service level commitment obligations, particularly in the early stage of our development, could reduce the confidence of our customers and could consequently impair our ability to obtain and retain customers, which would adversely affect both our ability to generate revenues and our operating results. Furthermore, we will be dependent upon internet service providers, telecommunications carriers and other website operators in the U.S., Asia and elsewhere, some of which may have experienced significant system failures and electrical outages in the past. Users of our services may in the future experience difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems and services. If for any reason, these providers failed to provide the required services, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. A portion of the managed services business we acquired in the combination involves the processing and storage of confidential customer information. Inappropriate use of those services could jeopardize the security of customers’ confidential information causing losses of data or financially impacting us or our customers. Efforts to alleviate problems caused by computer viruses or other inappropriate uses or security breaches may lead to interruptions, delays or cessation of our managed services. There is no known prevention or defense against denial of service attacks. During a prolonged denial of service attack, the Internet service will not be available for several hours, thus impacting hosted customers on-line business transactions. Affected customers might file claims against us under such circumstances. To the extent a failure of our physical infrastructure, services, or services provided by service providers results in decreased revenues, we may not be able to comply with covenants in our credit facility. If we are 38 Table of Contents unable to comply with covenants in our credit facility, the banks may require repayment of all outstanding amounts, and we do not have sufficient cash reserves to repay those amounts. Our business could be harmed by prolonged electrical power outages or shortages, increased costs of energy or general availability of electrical resources. Our IBX hubs are susceptible to regional costs of power, electrical power shortages, planned or unplanned power outages caused by these shortages, such as those that occurred in California during 2001, and limitations, especially internationally, of adequate power resources. The overall power shortage in California has increased the cost of energy, which we may not be able to pass on to our customers. We attempt to limit exposure to system downtime by using backup generators and power supplies. Power outages, which last beyond our backup and alternative power arrangements, could harm our customers and our business. We may experience service interruptions, loss of customers and drain on resources if we are unable to renew our facility leases. We have several short-term leases on our IBX hubs that are located outside of North America. For example, we currently lease approximately 86,100 square feet for our facility in Singapore, of which approximately 71,900 square feet expire in July 2003. Upon its expiration, we may not be able to renew our leases under reasonable terms, if at all and may have to relocate our IBX hubs to other facilities. A relocation of any IBX hub could result in service interruptions and significant additional expenses. In addition, seeking a new facility could divert management’s attention and our resources. We may make acquisitions, which pose integration and other risks that could harm our business. We may seek to acquire complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. As a result of these acquisitions, we may be required to incur additional debt and expenditures and issue additional shares of our stock to pay for the acquired business, product, service or technology, which will dilute existing stockholders’ ownership interest in the combined company. In addition, if we fail to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses, products, services and technologies, our business and financial results would be harmed. We are subject to securities class action litigation, which may harm our business and results of operations. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. During the quarter ended September 30, 2001, putative shareholder class action lawsuits were filed against us, a number of our officers and directors, and several investment banks that were underwriters of our initial public offering. The suits allege that the underwriter defendants agreed to allocate stock in our initial public offering to certain investors in exchange for excessive and undisclosed commissions and agreements by those investors to make additional purchases in the aftermarket at pre-determined prices. Plaintiffs allege that the prospectus for our initial public offering was false and misleading and in violation of the securities laws because it did not disclose these arrangements. The defense of this litigation may increase our expenses and divert management’s attention and resources. An adverse outcome in this litigation could seriously harm our business and results of operations. In addition, we may, in the future, be subject to other securities class action or similar litigation. Risks related to our Industry If the economy does not improve and the use of the Internet and electronic business does not grow, our revenues may not grow. Acceptance and use of the Internet may not continue to develop at historical rates and a sufficiently broad base of consumers may not adopt or continue to use the Internet and other online services as a medium of 39 Table of Contents commerce. Demand for Internet services and products are subject to a high level of uncertainty and are subject to significant pricing pressure, especially in Asia-Pacific. In addition, even if consumers do adopt and continue to use online services, we do not expect a significant increase in revenues until the economy begins to improve generally. As a result, we cannot be certain that a viable market for our IBX hubs will materialize. If the market for our IBX hubs grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, our revenues will not grow and our operating results will suffer. If we cannot grow revenues while reducing costs, we may not be able to comply with the covenants in our credit facility. If we breach the credit facility, the banks could require repayment of all amounts previously drawn down and we do not have sufficient cash reserves to repay such amounts. Government regulation may adversely affect the use of the Internet and our business. Various laws and governmental regulations governing Internet related services, related communications services and information technologies, and electronic commerce remain largely unsettled, even in areas where there has been some legislative action. This is true both in the U.S. and the various foreign countries in which we now operate. It may take years to determine whether and how existing laws, such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel, telecommunications services, and taxation, apply to the Internet and to related services such as ours. The combined company has little experience with such international regulatory issues and substantial resources of the company may be required to comply with regulations or bring any non-complaint business practices into compliance with such regulations. In addition, the development of the market for online commerce and the displacement of traditional telephony service by the Internet and related communications services may prompt increased call for more stringent consumer protection laws or other regulation both in the U.S. and abroad, that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online and their services providers. The compliance with, adoption of or modification of laws or regulations relating to the Internet, or interpretations of the existing law, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Recent terrorist activity throughout the world and military action to counter terrorism could adversely impact our business. The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the U.S., the ensuing declaration of war on terrorism and the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility appear to be having an adverse effect on business, financial and general economic conditions internationally. These effects may, in turn, result in increased costs due to the need to provide enhanced security, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. These circumstances may also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, our ability to raise capital and the operation and maintenance of our IBX hubs. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections” (“SFAS 145”). SFAS 145 rescinds the automatic treatment of gains or losses from extinguishment of debt as extraordinary unless they meet the criteria for extraordinary items as outlined in APB Opinion No. 30, “Reporting the Results of Operations, Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions.” In addition, SFAS 145 also requires sale-leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions and makes various technical corrections to existing pronouncements. SFAS 145 is effective for us for all financial statements issued in fiscal 2003; however, as allowed under the provisions of SFAS 145, we decided to early adopt SFAS 145 in relation to extinguishments of debt for the year ended December 31, 2002. As a result of the early adoption of SFAS 145, the gains on debt extinguishment that we realized in 2002 from the extinguishment of senior notes during the year were not reported as extraordinary transactions. 40 Table of Contents In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities” (“SFAS 146”). SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. SFAS 146 eliminates the definition and requirement for recognition of exit costs in Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3 where a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity’s commitment to an exit plan. This statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS 146 during the first quarter of 2003. We do not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (“FIN 45”). FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize a liability for obligations it has undertaken in relation to the issuance of a guarantee in addition to providing additional disclosures on such guarantees. The liability would be recorded at fair value on the date the guarantee is issued. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for the interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45 are effective after December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2002, the Company adopted the disclosure requirements of FIN 45. We are currently evaluating the effects of the liability measurement provisions of FIN 45 on our financial statements commencing in fiscal 2003. In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables” (“EITF 00-21”). EITF 00-21 provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF 00-21 will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation— Transition and Disclosure—an Amendment of SFAS No. 123” (“SFAS 148”). SFAS 148 encourages the adoption of the accounting provisions of SFAS 123 and requires additional disclosure, including in interim financial statements, for all companies regardless of whether or not they adopt the accounting provisions of SFAS 123. This statement is effective for our fiscal 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the new interim disclosure provisions are effective for the first quarter of 2004. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN 46”), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51.” FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. We are currently assessing the impact of the pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk The following discussion about market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent we are exposed to fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity. 41 Table of Contents In the past, we have employed foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging certain specifically identified net currency exposures. The use of these financial instruments was intended to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, but does not eliminate such risks. We may decide to employ such contracts again in the future. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. Our interest income is impacted by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly since the majority of our investments are in short-term instruments. Due to the short-term nature of our investments, we do not believe that we are subject to any material market risk exposure. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our investment portfolio. We would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be significantly affected by a sudden change in market interest rates in our investment portfolio. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates would furthermore not have a material impact to our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of our long-term debt obligations, except for the interest expense associated with our credit facility, which bears interest at floating rates, plus applicable margins, based on either the prime rate or LIBOR. As of December 31, 2002, the credit facility had an effective interest rate of 6.21%. The fair market value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate changes may affect the fair market value of the fixed interest rate debt but does not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair market value of our senior notes is based on quoted market prices. The estimated fair value of our senior notes as of December 31, 2002 was approximately $4.6 million. Foreign Currency Risk To date, all of our recognized revenue has been denominated in U.S. dollars, generated mostly from customers in the U.S., and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations has been minimal. However, commencing in fiscal 2003, as a result of the combination, approximately 15% of our revenues will be in the Asia-Pacific region, and a large portion of those revenues will be denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Singapore dollar, Japanese yen and Hong Kong and Australian dollars. As a result, our operating results and cash flows will be impacted due to currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, to the extent that our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our services less competitive in the international markets. Although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations, and when appropriate, may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations, we cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future. Commodity Price Risk Certain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of significant price changes are electricity and supplies and equipment used in our IBX hubs. We are closely monitoring the cost of electricity, particularly in California. To the extent that electricity costs continue to rise, we are investigating opportunities to pass these additional power costs onto our customers that utilize this power. We do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk. 42 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:28:06.730112

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information in this discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements are based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. For example, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Risk Factors” below. All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Overview Equinix provides network neutral colocation, interconnection and managed services to enterprises, content companies and systems integrators and the world’s largest networks. Through our 14 IBX hubs in the U.S. and Asia, customers can directly interconnect with each other for critical traffic exchange requirements. As of December 31, 2003, we had IBX hubs totaling an aggregate of more than 1.2 million gross square feet in the Washington, D.C., New York, Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles, Honolulu and Silicon Valley areas in the United States and Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo in the Asia-Pacific region. In our IBX hubs, customers can directly interconnect with each other for critical traffic exchange requirements. Direct interconnection to our aggregation of networks, which serve more than 90% of the world’s Internet routes, allows our customers to increase performance while significantly reducing costs. Based on our network neutral model and the quality of our IBX hubs, we believe we have established a critical mass of customers, comprised of networks, content providers and other enterprise companies. As more customers locate in our IBX hubs, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to do so as well to gain the full economic and performance benefits of direct interconnection. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a “network effect” of customer adoption. Our interconnection services enable scalable, reliable and cost-effective interconnection and traffic exchange thus lowering overall cost and increasing flexibility. This critical mass of customers and the resulting network effect, combined with our improved financial position gained through the completion of a series of financing transactions at the end of 2002, our follow-on equity offering in November 2003 and our convertible debenture offering in February 2004 (refer to “Recent Developments” below), has resulted in an acceleration of new customer growth and related revenue bookings. Both our existing and new customers continue to gain confidence in our financial stability, which helps make their decision easier to move their core infrastructure into our IBX hubs. While we had generated negative operating cashflow in each annual period since inception, commencing the quarter ended September 30, 2003 we started to generate positive operating cash flow. During this quarter, our recurring revenues grew to a level sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements related to our predominantly fixed cost structure. We considered this quarter to be the inflection point in our business model whereby our revenues were sufficient on an ongoing basis to meet all our operating costs and working capital requirements. Given a large component of our cost of revenues are fixed in nature, we anticipate any growth in revenues will have a significant incremental flow through to gross profit in the 70 – 90% range. As a result of reaching this point in our operating history, we expect to generate cash from our operations during 2004 and expect these operating cash flows to also be sufficient to meet our cash requirements to fund our capital expenditures. Historically, our market has been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled their telecommunication products and services with their colocation offerings. During 2003, a number of these 15 Table of Contents telecommunication carriers reduced their colocation footprint as they exited under-performing markets. In addition, one major telecommunications company, Sprint, announced their plans to exit the colocation and hosting market altogether to focus on their core service offerings, while another telecommunications company, Cable & Wireless Plc, sold their U.S. assets to another telecommunications company, Savvis Communications Corp, in a bankruptcy auction. Each of these colocation providers owns and operates a network. We do not operate a network, yet have greater than 170 networks operating out of our IBX hubs. As a result, we are able to offer our customers a substantial choice of networks given our network neutrality allowing our customers to choose from numerous network service providers thereby eliminating a single point of failure. We believe this is a distinct advantage we have over our telecommunications company competitors, especially when the telecommunications industry is experiencing so many business challenges and changes as evidenced by the numerous bankruptcies and consolidations within this industry during the past several years. Furthermore, for those customers who do require a fully managed solution that these telecommunications companies typically provide, certain of our other customers, such as IBM and EDS, can provide such a solution within our network rich IBX hubs. Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and service streams, such as our recent acquisition of the Sprint property in Santa Clara (refer to “Recent Developments” below). However, we will continue to be very selective with any similar opportunity. As was the case with the Sprint property, the criteria will be quality of the design, access to networks, capacity availability in current market location, amount of incremental investment in the targeted property, lead-time to breakeven and in-place customers. Like the Sprint property, the right combination of these factors may be quite attractive for us. Dependent on the particular deal, these acquisitions may require additional capital expenditures in order to bring these centers up to Equinix standards. Recent Developments On November 21, 2003, we sold 5.5 million shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $20.00 per share, which resulted in net proceeds to the Company of $104.4 million. We refer to this transaction as the “follow-on equity offering.” In addition, in conjunction with our follow-on equity offering, we received consent from our senior lenders to amend the terms of our credit facility and permanently repaid $55.2 million of the then outstanding principal balance of $90.5 million. On December 1, 2003, we closed a definitive agreement to sublease Sprint’s E|Solutions Internet Center in Santa Clara, California, and acquire certain related assets. The 160,000 square foot data center became our 14th IBX hub, expanding our global footprint to over 1.2 million square feet in eleven markets. Sprint’s Santa Clara center provides a physical infrastructure that is consistent with our industry leading standards, and currently hosts some of the top Internet companies. Consistent with our model of network-neutrality, we will offer a choice of networks in the new center. On February 11, 2004, we sold $75.0 million in aggregate principal of 2.5% convertible subordinated debentures due 2024 to qualified institutional buyers. Subsequently, on February 18, 2004, we sold an additional $11.25 million of our debentures to the initial purchasers of these debentures. We used or intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay all amounts outstanding under our credit facility and two of our other debt facilities. In addition, we intend to use the proceeds received to redeem our 13% senior notes. We have exercised our right to redeem all of its 13% senior notes, which have a total of $30.5 million of principal outstanding and have sent a notice of redemption to the trustee. The effective date of the redemption is expected to be March 12, 2004. The redemption price for the senior notes will be equal to 106.5% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Lastly, all remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. We expect to record a significant loss on debt extinguishment during the quarter ended March 31, 2004, primarily related to the non-cash write-off of debt issuance costs and discounts in connection with these various debt repayments and redemptions, as well as the cash premium that we will pay on our 13% senior notes. We refer to this transaction as the “convertible debenture offering”. 16 Table of Contents The Combination, Financing, Senior Note Exchange and Crosslink Financing In October 2002, we entered into agreements to consummate a series of related acquisition and financing transactions. These transactions closed on December 31, 2002. Under the terms of these agreements, we combined our business with two similar businesses, that of i-STT Pte Ltd, or i-STT, and Pihana Pacific, Inc., or Pihana. i-STT’s business was based in Singapore, with operations in Singapore and a joint venture in Thailand. Pihana’s business was based in Hawaii, with operations in Honolulu, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Sydney. In connection with the acquisition of i-STT and Pihana, we issued approximately 3.5 million shares of our common stock and approximately 1.9 million shares of our Series A preferred stock. We refer to this transaction as the “combination.” In conjunction with the combination, we issued to i-STT’s former parent company, STT Communications Ltd., or STT Communications, a $30.0 million convertible secured note in exchange for cash. We refer to this transaction as the “financing.” In connection with the combination and financing, we amended the terms of the indenture governing our senior notes and extinguished $116.8 million of our senior notes in exchange for a combination of 1.9 million shares of our common stock and $15.2 million of cash. We refer to this transaction as the “senior note exchange.” Because we extinguished the debt in the senior note exchange at a significant discount, we recognized a substantial gain on debt extinguishment during the fourth quarter of 2002. Furthermore, in conjunction with the combination, financing and senior note exchange, we amended our credit facility, and on December 31, 2002, we completed a 32 for 1 reverse stock split of our common stock in order to comply with Nasdaq initial listing requirements. Unless otherwise noted, all share and per share amounts in this prospectus supplement have been adjusted to give effect to the reverse stock split. In April 2003, Equinix and certain of our subsidiaries and STT Communications entered into agreements with various entities affiliated with Crosslink Capital for a $10.0 million cash investment in Equinix in the form of additional convertible secured notes. This transaction closed in June 2003. We refer to this transaction as the “Crosslink financing.” Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: • Revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts; • Accounting for income taxes; • Estimated and contingent liabilities; • Accounting for property and equipment; and • Impairment of long-lived assets. Revenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We derive more than 90% of our revenues from recurring revenue streams, consisting primarily of (i) colocation services, such as the licensing of cabinet 17 Table of Contents space, power and bandwidth; (ii) interconnection services, such as cross connects and Gigabit Ethernet Ports; and (iii) managed infrastructure services, such as Equinix Direct and various other e-business services such as mail service and managed platform solutions. The remainder of our revenues are from non-recurring revenue streams, such as from the recognized portion of deferred installation, professional services, contract settlements and equipment sales. Revenues from recurring revenue streams are billed monthly and recognized ratably over the term of the contract, generally one to three years. Fees for the provision of e-business services are recognized progressively as the services are rendered in accordance with the contract terms, except where the future costs cannot be reliably estimated, in which case fees are recognized upon the completion of services. Non-recurring installation fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the related contract. Professional service fees are recognized in the period in which the services were provided and represent the culmination of the earnings process. Revenue from bandwidth and equipment is recognized on a gross basis in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Abstract No. 99-19, “Recording Revenue as a Principal versus Net as an Agent”, primarily because we act as the principal in the transaction, take title to products and services and bear inventory and credit risk. Revenue from contract settlements is recognized on a cash basis when no remaining performance obligations exist. In some cases, we guarantee certain service levels, such as uptime, as outlined in individual customer contracts. To the extent that these service levels are not achieved, we reduce revenue for any credits given to the customer as a result. We generally have the ability to determine such service level credits prior to the associated revenue being recognized, and historically, these credits have not been significant. Revenue is recognized only when the service is provided and when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured. It is customary business practice to obtain a signed master sales agreement and sales order prior to recognizing revenue in an arrangement. We assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the credit-worthiness of the customer. We generally do not request collateral from our customers. If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured, we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. In addition, we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments for those customers that we had expected to collect the revenues. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they become insolvent, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, allowances for doubtful accounts may be required. Management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and current economic news and trends, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating revenue recognition and the adequacy of our reserves. Our customer base has historically been composed of businesses throughout the U.S. Commencing in fiscal year 2003, our revenues include revenues from our newly-acquired Asia-Pacific operations. For the year ended December 31, 2003 our revenues were split approximately 85% in the U.S. and 15% in Asia-Pacific. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers. As of December 31, 2003, one customer, IBM, accounted for 15% of annual revenues and 11% of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2002, this same customer accounted for 20% of annual revenues and 15% of accounts receivable. No other single customer accounted for greater than 10% of accounts receivable or annual revenues for the periods presented. Accounting for Income Taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected more likely than not to be realized. 18 Table of Contents We currently have provided for a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets and our net operating losses. We have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. Based on the available objective evidence, management does not believe that the net deferred tax assets will be fully realizable. Should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future, a reversed adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made. Estimated and Contingent Liabilities. Management estimates exposure on certain liabilities and contingent liabilities, such as property taxes and litigation, based on the best information available at the time of determination. With respect to real and personal property taxes, management records what it can reasonably estimate based on prior payment history, current landlord estimates or estimates based on current or changing fixed asset values in each specific municipality, as applicable. However, there are circumstances beyond our control whereby the underlying value of the property or basis for which the tax is calculated on said property may change, such as a landlord selling the underlying property of one of our IBX hub leases or a municipality changing the assessment value in a jurisdiction and, as a result, our property tax obligations may vary from period to period. Based upon the most current facts and circumstances, we make the necessary property tax accruals for each of our reporting periods. However, revisions in our estimates of the potential or actual liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position. For litigation claims, when management can reasonably estimate the range of loss and when an unfavorable outcome is probable, a contingent liability is recorded. For current legal proceedings, management believes that it has adequate legal defenses and that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cashflows. Furthermore, because of the uncertainties as to the outcome of these proceedings and since no range of loss can be estimated at this time, management has determined that no accrual is needed. As additional information becomes available, we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position. Accounting for Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are stated at original cost, or in the case of IBX hubs that we acquire, at fair value at the time of acquisition. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally two to five years for non-IBX hub equipment and seven to ten years for IBX hub equipment. Leasehold improvements and assets acquired under capital lease are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset or improvement. Should management determine that the actual useful lives of our property and equipment placed into service is less than originally anticipated, or if any of our property and equipment was deemed to have incurred an impairment, additional depreciation, or an impairment charge would be required, which would decrease net income in the period such determination was made. Conversely, should management determine that the actual useful lives of its property and equipment placed into service was greater than originally anticipated, less depreciation may be required, which would increase net income in the period such determination was made. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. We account for the impairment of long-lived assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard, or SFAS, No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”, or in the case of goodwill, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. We evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived assets, consisting primarily of our IBX hubs and goodwill, whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable or at least on an annual basis during the fourth quarter for goodwill. Such events or circumstances include, but are not limited to, a prolonged industry downturn, a significant decline in our market value or significant reductions in projected future cash flows. Significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows, including profit margins, long-term forecasts of the amounts and 19 Table of Contents timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market, groupings of assets, discount rates and terminal growth rates. In addition, significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long-lived assets, including replacement cost, economic obsolescence, and the value that could be realized in orderly liquidation. Changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long-lived assets, thereby requiring us to write down the assets. Our net long-lived assets as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, included property and equipment of $343.6 million and $390.0 million, respectively, and goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets of $23.5 million and $25.0 million, respectively. Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 Revenues. Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were split between the following revenue classifications (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2003 % 2002 % Recurring revenues $ 109,957 93 % $ 65,319 85 % Non-recurring revenues: Installation and professional services 6,221 5 % 4,056 5 % Other 1,764 2 % 7,813 10 % 7,985 7 % 11,869 15 % Total revenues $ 117,942 100 % $ 77,188 100 % Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were geographically comprised of the following (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2003 % 2002 % U.S. revenues $ 99,669 85 % $ 77,188 100 % Asia-Pacific revenues 18,273 15 % — 0 % Total revenues $ 117,942 100 % $ 77,188 100 % We recognized revenues of $117.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to revenues of $77.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, a 53% increase. Included in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, are the results of the two companies that we acquired on December 31, 2002, i-STT and Pihana, totaling $23.4 million. We segment our business geographically between the U.S. and Asia-Pacific as further discussed below. Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation, interconnection and managed infrastructure services. We consider these services as recurring as once a customer has been installed in one of our IBX hubs they are billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues are a significant component of our total revenues comprising 93% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase from the 85% level in the prior year. To review our revenue recognition policies for our recurring revenue streams, refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” above. Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer’s initial deployment and, professional services that we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring as they are billed typically once and only upon completion of the installation or professional services work performed. 20 Table of Contents The non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer. Installation and professional services revenues increased 53% year over year, primarily due to strong existing and new customer growth during the year. As a percent of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent approximately 5% of total revenues in each year. Other non-recurring revenues include equipment resales and customer settlements. This non-recurring revenue line decreased significantly from the prior year as (i) we are no longer pursuing equipment resales due to their poor margin characteristics and (ii) the number of customer right-sizings and settlements decreased substantially during 2003. To review our revenue recognition policies for our non-recurring revenue streams, refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” above. In addition to reviewing recurring versus non-recurring revenues, we look at two other primary metrics when we analyze our revenues: 1) customer count and 2) percentage utilization. Our customer count increased to 712 as of December 31, 2003 versus 568 as of December 31, 2002, an increase of 25%. Our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus total cabinet space available. Our utilization rate as of December 31, 2003 was 37% versus 29% as of December 31, 2002, an increase of 28%, including our Asia-Pacific operations for both periods. Although we have substantial capacity for growth, our utilization rates vary from market to market among our 14 worldwide IBX hubs. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. Therefore, consistent with our acquisition of the Sprint’s Santa Clara property in December 2003, we will continue to review our available space in our other operating markets. U.S. Revenues. We recognized U.S. revenues of $99.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $77.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. U.S. revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $93.6 million and $65.3 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, a 43% increase. U.S. recurring revenues consist primarily of colocation and interconnection services plus a nominal amount of managed infrastructure services. U.S. recurring revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes $5.1 million of revenues generated from the two U.S. IBX hubs acquired from Pihana on December 31, 2002 located in Los Angeles and Honolulu. Excluding revenues from these acquired U.S. IBX hubs, the period over period growth in recurring revenues of 60% was primarily the result of an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customer growth acquired during the year as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate as discussed above. In addition, consistent with the growth in our customer base, our interconnection revenues have grown as our customers continue to expand their interconnection activity with each other. As of December 31, 2003, U.S. interconnection revenue represented 21% of total U.S. recurring revenue as compared to 9% in the prior year. We expect our U.S. recurring revenues to continue to grow and remain our most significant source of revenue for the foreseeable future. In addition, U.S. revenues consisted of non-recurring revenues of $6.1 million and $11.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. Non-recurring revenues are primarily related to the recognized portion of deferred installation, professional services, settlement fees associated with certain contract terminations and equipment resales. The period over period decrease in U.S. non-recurring revenues was primarily the result of $2.9 million of equipment resale revenue and $4.9 million in settlement fees from customers to terminate their contract recognized during the year ended December 31, 2002. There were no equipment resale transactions during the year ended December 31, 2003; however, we received $1.2 million of settlement fees during the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily as a result of bankruptcy related payments from both Worldcom and Excite@home. Excluding any settlement fees that we may recognize in the future, we expect our U.S. non-recurring revenues to remain relatively flat or grow moderately in the foreseeable future. Asia-Pacific Revenues. As a result of the combination that closed on December 31, 2002, which resulted in the acquisition of four Asia-Pacific IBX hubs, we recognized $18.2 million of revenues in Asia-Pacific during the year ended December 31, 2003. Prior to the combination we generated no revenues from outside of the United States. Asia-Pacific revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $16.3 million, primarily from colocation and managed infrastructure services, and non-recurring revenues of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, which includes settlement fees of $584,000, primarily from one customer that terminated its contract. Asia- Pacific revenues are generated from Singapore, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney with Singapore representing 21 Table of Contents approximately 77% of the regional revenues. Our Asia-Pacific revenues are similar to the revenues that we generate from our U.S. IBX hubs; however, our Singapore IBX hub has additional managed infrastructure service revenue, such as mail service and managed platform solutions, which we do not currently offer in any other IBX hub location. We expect our Asia-Pacific revenues to decrease slightly during the first half of 2004 as we expect some churn on our low-margin bandwidth revenue in Singapore. However, excluding this expected drop in bandwidth revenue, we would otherwise expect our Asia-Pacific revenues to begin to grow over the course of the year. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues were $128.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 versus $104.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, a 23% increase. Included in cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 are the results of the two companies that we acquired on December 31, 2002, i-STT and Pihana, a cumulative total of $24.7 million. The largest cost components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX hubs, utility costs including bandwidth, IBX employees’ salaries and benefits, consumable supplies and equipment and security services. A substantial majority of our cost of revenues are fixed in nature and do not vary significantly from period to period. However, there are certain costs, which are considered variable in nature including utilities and consumable supplies that are directly related to growth of services in our existing and new customer base. Given a large component of our cost of revenues are fixed in nature, we anticipate any growth in revenues will have a significant incremental flow through to gross profit in the 70 – 90% range. U.S. Cost of Revenues. U.S. cost of revenues were $107.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $104.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, a 3.2% increase. U.S. cost of revenues included $49.9 million and $47.8 million, respectively, of depreciation expense and $59,000 and $266,000, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we also recorded $562,000 of accretion expense associated with our asset retirement obligation relating to our various leaseholds, which consist primarily of our IBX hub operating leases, as required under FASB No. 143 that was adopted in 2003. Furthermore, U.S. cost of revenues included the costs associated with the $2.9 million of equipment resale revenue that we recorded for the year ended December 31, 2002, which was approximately $2.8 million. We recorded no equipment resale revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003. Included in the U.S. cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, were the operating costs associated with (i) the Los Angeles and Honolulu IBX hubs acquired from Pihana in the combination on December 31, 2002, which totaled $4.1 million ($3.5 million excluding depreciation) and (ii) the Santa Clara IBX hub acquired on December 1, 2003, which totaled $597,000. Excluding depreciation, stock-based compensation, accretion expense, the costs of equipment resales and the costs of operating the acquired U.S. IBX hubs, U.S. cash cost of revenues decreased period over period to $52.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $53.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, a 1% decrease. This decrease is primarily the result of reduced costs associated with the San Jose ground lease of $3.6 million as a result of the option that we exercised in September 2002 to return approximately one-half of the land commencing in October 2002 (refer to ‘Restructuring Charges” below); however, this decrease is partially offset by an increase in operating costs associated with certain of our IBX hubs as a result of (a) higher property taxes for certain IBX hubs and (b) increasing utility costs in line with increasing customer installations and revenues attributed to this customer growth. We continue to anticipate that our cost of revenues will increase in the foreseeable future as the occupancy levels in our U.S. IBX hubs increase, however as a percent of revenues, we anticipate our cost of revenues will continue to decline. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. As a result of the combination that closed on December 31, 2002, which resulted in the acquisition of four Asia-Pacific IBX hubs, we incurred an additional $20.6 million in cost of revenues from our Asia-Pacific IBX hub operations during the year ended December 31, 2003. Included in this number is $4.4 million of depreciation expense. Excluding depreciation expense, our acquired cost of revenues totaled $16.2 million for Asia-Pacific. Our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues consist of the same type of costs that we incur in our U.S. IBX hub operations, namely rental payments for our leased IBX hubs, utility costs, site employees’ salaries and benefits, consumable supplies and equipment and security services. Our Asia-Pacific 22 Table of Contents costs of revenues are generated in Singapore, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney. There are several managed IT infrastructure service revenue streams unique to our Singapore IBX hub, such as mail service and managed platform solutions, that are more labor intensive than our service offerings in the United States. As a result, our Singapore IBX hub has a greater number of employees than any of our other IBX hubs, and therefore, a greater labor cost relative to our other IBX hubs in the United States or other Asia-Pacific locations. We anticipate that our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues will experience a small decrease during the first half of 2004 as a result of the expected drop in low-margin bandwidth revenue as discussed above. However, excluding this, we would otherwise expect to see moderate growth in Asia-Pacific cost of revenues in the foreseeable future consistent with our anticipated growth in revenues over the course of the year. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Included in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003, are the results of the two companies that we acquired on December 31, 2002, i-STT and Pihana, totaling $6.9 million. U.S. Sales and Marketing Expenses. U.S. sales and marketing expenses decreased to $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Included in U.S. sales and marketing expenses were $294,000 and $952,000, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded $2.3 million in bad debt expense. The amount of bad debt expense that we recorded in the prior period, which was significantly larger than what we typically incur, was primarily the result of write-offs or full reserves of aged receivables associated with several customers, including Teleglobe, which had filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code last year. Excluding stock-based compensation and bad debt expense, U.S. sales and marketing expenses increased to $12.4 million from $12.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, a 3% increase. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel. Excluding stock-based compensation and bad debt expense, the nominal increase in sales and marketing expenses year over year is primarily related to the incremental sales and marketing efforts associated with the two U.S. IBX hubs acquired in the combination as of December 31, 2002 in Los Angeles and Honolulu, as well as an overall increase in sales compensation due to increased revenues. We expect to see a nominal increase in sales and marketing spending in the future, although as a percent of revenues, we anticipate a decline in sales and marketing spending. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. As a result of the combination that closed on December 31, 2002, we incurred an additional $6.9 million of sales and marketing expenses, comprised of $4.8 million in cash sales and marketing expenses from our Asia-Pacific operations during the year ended December 31, 2003, and $2.1 million of amortization expense. Our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses consist of the same type of costs that we incur in our U.S. operations, namely compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel. Our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses are generated in Singapore, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney. We expect that our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses will remain relatively flat in the foreseeable future. As a result of the combination that closed on December 31, 2002, we acquired several intangible assets that we amortize, namely the use of a trade-name and certain customer contracts in Singapore valued at approximately $300,000 and $3.6 million, respectively. The trade-name intangible asset was being amortized over one year ending December 31, 2003 and the customer contract intangible asset is being amortized over two years, ending December 31, 2004. As a result, we incurred a total of $2.1 million of amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2003. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased to $34.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Included in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003, are the results of the two companies that we acquired on December 31, 2002, i-STT and Pihana, totaling $7.5 million. 23 Table of Contents U.S. General and Administrative Expenses. U.S. general and administrative expenses decreased to $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Included in U.S. general and administrative expenses were $5.3 million and $6.2 million, respectively, of depreciation expense and $2.6 million and $5.7 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. In addition, U.S. general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003, included $1.5 million of costs associated with a corporate headquarter office acquired from Pihana on December 31, 2002 located in Honolulu. This office was closed as of June 30, 2003. Excluding depreciation, stock-based compensation expense and the costs of the acquired Honolulu office, U.S. general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat at $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. General and administrative expenses, excluding depreciation and stock-based compensation, consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, accounting, legal and administrative expenses, professional service fees and other general corporate expenses such as our corporate headquarter office lease. We expect to see a nominal increase in general and administrative spending in the future, although as a percent of revenues, we anticipate a decline in general and administrative spending. Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. As a result of the combination that closed on December 31, 2002, we incurred an additional $6.0 million in general and administrative expenses from our newly-acquired Asia-Pacific operations. Our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses, which included $497,000 of depreciation expense, consist of the same type of costs that we incur in our U.S. operations, namely salaries and related expenses, accounting, legal and administrative expenses, professional service fees and other general corporate expenses. Our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses are generated in Singapore, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney. Our Asia-Pacific headquarter office is located in Singapore. Most of the corporate overhead support functions that we have in the U.S. also reside in our Singapore office in order to support our Asia-Pacific operations. In addition, we have separate corporate office locations in Tokyo and Hong Kong. We expect that our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses will remain relatively flat or experience only moderate growth for the foreseeable future. Restructuring Charges. We did not incur any restructuring charges during the year ended December 31, 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded restructuring charges of $28.9 million. The restructuring charges consisted of (a) a $5.0 million option fee paid in May 2002 related to the amendment of our approximately 80 acre ground lease in San Jose, California from which we subsequently elected to exercise the option to permanently exclude 40 acres commencing October 1, 2002; (b) a partial write-off of two letters of credit totaling $19.0 million associated with the exercise in September 2002 of our option to permanently terminate approximately one-half of our lease obligations under the San Jose ground lease (c) a write-off of property and equipment of $2.6 million, primarily leasehold improvements and some equipment, located in two unnecessary U.S. IBX expansion and headquarter office space operating leaseholds we had decided to exit and that do not currently provide any ongoing benefit and (d) write-offs or accruals of certain U.S. or European exit costs and severance charges. Interest Income. Interest income decreased to $296,000 from $998,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Interest income decreased due to lower average cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balances held in interest-bearing accounts and lower interest rates received on those invested balances. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $20.5 million from $35.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The significant decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the retirement of $169.5 million of our 13% senior notes during 2002. In addition, we reduced the interest expense attributed to our credit facility as a result of a reduction in the principal balance outstanding and a reduction in the interest rates. However, these interest expense savings were partially offset by the approximately $7.3 million of non-cash interest expense associated with the $30.0 million 14% convertible secured note issued on December 31, 2002 as a result of the financing, and the $10.0 million 10% convertible 24 Table of Contents secured notes issued on June 5, 2003 as a result of the Crosslink financing. We recorded a substantial debt discount equal to the $10.0 million of principal in connection with the Crosslink financing, primarily as a result of the beneficial conversion feature associated with these convertible secured notes, which is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Crosslink financing. This is a primary contributor to our increased non-cash interest expense from the prior period. Gain on Debt Extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we retired approximately $169.5 million of senior notes in exchange for approximately 2.4 million shares of common stock and $17.7 million of cash. As a result, we recognized a $114.2 million net gain on debt extinguishment during 2002, after deducting transaction costs, interest waived and allocation of unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discount. Although we made payments on our various debt facilities during 2003, we extinguished no senior notes or other debt during the year ended December 31, 2003. Income Taxes. A full valuation allowance is recorded against our deferred tax assets as management cannot conclude, based on available objective evidence, when it is more likely than not that the gross value of its deferred tax assets will be realized. Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 Revenues. We recognized revenues of $77.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to revenues of $63.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $65.3 million and $57.6 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, primarily from the leasing of cabinet space, power and cross connects. Non-recurring revenues were $11.9 million and $5.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, primarily related to the recognized portion of deferred installation revenue and custom service revenues and settlement fees associated with certain customer right-sizing or contract terminations. Settlement fees recognized during the year ended December 31, 2002 totaled approximately $4.5 million, including a $2.8 million one-time settlement with Qwest received in the third quarter of 2002, and approximately $562,000 for the corresponding period in 2001. Installation and service fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Custom service revenues are recognized upon completion of the services. Settlement fees are recognized upon contract termination. In February and March 2002, we entered into equipment reseller agreements with two related party companies. Included within the $11.9 million of non-recurring revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002, were $2.9 million of equipment resales resulting from these two equipment reseller agreements. There were no equipment resales in the year ended December 31, 2001. Excluding equipment resales, we recognized revenues of $74.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to revenues of $63.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, a 17% increase. The period over period growth in revenues was primarily the result of an increase in orders from existing customers and growth in our customer base from 218 customers as of December 31, 2001 to 303 customers as of December 31, 2002 on a pre-combination basis and settlement fees associated with certain customer right-sizing or contract terminations. However, this growth in our customer base was partially offset by a number of our larger customers reducing the size of their contractual commitments to us. We refer to this effort as the “right-sizing” of our larger customer contracts. During late 2001 and throughout 2002, we proactively worked with certain of our larger customers to right-size their contractual commitments to help them better react to a slowdown in customer demand as a result of weaker economic conditions. Although these right-sizing efforts often result in a reduction in the number of cabinets these customers are obligated to pay for, many of these right-sizing efforts have resulted in the customer extending the term for the remaining cabinets. As a result, although the short-term recurring revenues from such customers are reduced, the overall contract value at times remains intact and the relationship with the customer is preserved, if not improved. As of December 31, 2002, we had successfully completed the right-sizing of most of our customers that had more than 100 cabinets booked, a booking level that represents our larger customers. These right-sizing efforts were, throughout 2002, netted out against our new customer cabinet bookings, limiting our overall revenue growth during this period. 25 Table of Contents Commencing in fiscal 2003, our revenues included revenues from our newly-acquired Asia-Pacific operations. We expect that revenues commencing in 2003 will be split approximately 85% in the U.S. and 15% in Asia-Pacific. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased to $104.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $94.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. These amounts included $47.8 million and $40.0 million, respectively, of depreciation expense and $266,000 and $426,000, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. In addition to depreciation and stock-based compensation, cost of revenues consists primarily of rental payments for our leased IBX hubs, site employees’ salaries and benefits, utility costs, power and redundancy system engineering support services and related costs and security services. Furthermore, cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 included the costs associated with $2.9 million in equipment sales we recorded, which was approximately $2.8 million. Excluding depreciation, stock-based compensation expense and the costs of equipment sales, cost of revenues decreased slightly period over period to $53.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $54.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, a 2% decrease. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 included $5.0 million in costs related to our European expansion plans. Due to the restructuring charge that we recorded in the third quarter of 2001, these costs were not in our cash cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002; however, these savings were partially offset by the additional costs incurred of $3.7 million from (a) our newest and largest IBX hub opened during the first quarter of 2002 in the New York metropolitan area and (b) the costs associated with the ramp-up of our existing IBX hubs. In September 2002, we exercised an option to reduce the monthly operating costs under the San Jose ground lease by approximately one-half commencing October 2002, which resulted in savings of approximately $1.1 million as compared to the prior year. We anticipate that the costs associated with the continued ramp-up of our IBX hubs and the additional costs associated with some of our new services, such as bandwidth, will continue to increase in the foreseeable future; however, the cost savings resulting from the elimination of approximately half of the San Jose ground lease costs, which commenced in October 2002, should offset most of these increases for the foreseeable future in the U.S. However, commencing in fiscal 2003, our cost of revenues included the cost of revenues associated with our Asia-Pacific operations. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses decreased to $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. These amounts included $952,000 and $2.8 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. In addition, we recorded $2.3 million in bad debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to $477,000 recorded in the prior year. This substantial increase in bad debt expense was primarily the result of full provisions against aged receivables associated with two customers, Teleglobe and WorldCom, both of which filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 2002. Excluding stock-based compensation and bad debt expense, cash sales and marketing costs decreased to $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, a 12% decrease. Cash sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses is the result of several cost saving initiatives that we undertook, including staff reductions of approximately 25% during 2001 that resulted in approximately $2.6 million in annual savings in sales and marketing costs and an overall decrease in discretionary spending. We continue to closely monitor our spending in all areas as a result of the current market conditions. However, commencing in fiscal 2003, our sales and marketing expenses included the sales and marketing expenses associated with our Asia-Pacific operations. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased to $30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 from $58.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. These amounts included $5.7 million and $15.8 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense and $6.2 million and $9.6 million, respectively, of depreciation expense, resulting in $14.1 million or 43% decrease in period over period cash spending. Cash general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, accounting, legal and administrative expenses, professional service fees and other general corporate expenses. 26 Table of Contents The significant decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of several cost saving initiatives that we undertook, including staff reductions of approximately 25% during 2001 that resulted in approximately $4.9 million in annual savings in general and administrative costs and an overall decrease in discretionary spending. We continue to closely monitor our spending as a result of the current market conditions. However, commencing in fiscal 2003, our general and administrative expenses included the general and administrative expenses associated with our Asia-Pacific operations. Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded restructuring charges of $28.9 million. The restructuring charges consisted of (a) a $5.0 million option fee paid in May 2002 related to the amendment of our approximately 80 acre ground lease in San Jose, California from which we subsequently elected to exercise the option to permanently exclude 40 acres commencing October 1, 2002; (b) a write-off of property and equipment of $2.6 million, primarily leasehold improvements and some equipment, located in two unnecessary U.S. IBX expansion and headquarter office space operating leaseholds we had decided to exit and that do not currently provide any ongoing benefit; (c) a write-off of one U.S. letters of credit totaling $250,000 related to one U.S. operating leasehold we had committed to exit; (d) an accrual of $1.0 million related to the remaining estimated European exit costs; (e) an accrual of $925,000 in severance charges related to a less than 10% reduction in workforce in an effort to reduce the cost structure of our corporate headquarter function that will result in approximately $2.8 million in annual savings; (f) an accrual of $115,000 related to additional U.S. leasehold exit costs and (g) a partial write-off of two letters of credit totaling $19.0 million associated with the exercise in September 2002 of our option to permanently terminate approximately one-half of our lease obligations under the San Jose ground lease. During the quarter ended September 30, 2001, the Company took a restructuring charge of $48.6 million consisting of $45.3 million related to a revised European services strategy, $2.0 million for certain anticipated excess U.S. leasehold exit costs and $1.3 million related to a reduction in workforce, primarily in selling, general and administrative functions at the Company’s headquarters. During third quarter 2001, the Company decided to partner with another Internet exchange company in Europe rather than build and operate its own centers outside of the U.S. As a result, the Company i) recorded a write-down of its European construction in progress assets to their net realizable value and recorded a charge totaling $29.3 million, ii) accrued certain leasehold exit costs for its European leasehold interests in the amount of $6.4 million, iii) wrote-off its European letters of credit that secured the European leasehold interests in the amount of $8.6 million and iv) accrued various legal, storage and other costs totaling $1.0 million to facilitate this change in strategy. In addition, the Company incurred a $2.0 million restructuring charge for leasehold exit costs associated with certain excess U.S. leases and a $1.3 million restructuring charge related to an approximate 15% reduction in workforce in an effort to streamline and reduce the cost structure of the Company’s headquarter function. As of December 31, 2002, a total restructuring reserve of $1.7 million remained outstanding for all of the above accrued but unpaid restructuring charges. We began to realize the cost savings benefits resulting from the partial San Jose ground lease termination in cost of revenues during October 2002. Interest Income. Interest income decreased to $998,000 from $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Interest income decreased due to lower cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balances held in interest bearing accounts and lower interest rates received on those invested balances. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $35.1 million from $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in interest expense was attributable to the retirement of $52.8 million of our 13% senior notes during the first half of 2002 and to the decline in both the principal due and the interest rates associated with our credit facility. Gain on Debt Extinguishment. During the first half of 2002, we retired $52.8 million of our senior notes in exchange for approximately 500,000 shares of our common stock and approximately $2.5 million of cash. On 27 Table of Contents December 31, 2002, we retired an additional $116.8 million of our senior notes in exchange for approximately 1.9 million shares of our common stock and approximately $15.2 million of cash. As a result of these transactions, we recognized a $114.2 million net gain on debt extinguishment during 2002, after deducting transaction costs, interest waived and allocation of unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discount. Although we made payments on our various debt facilities during 2001, we extinguished no senior notes or other debt during the year ended December 31, 2001. Liquidity and Capital Resources Since inception, we have financed our operations and capital requirements primarily through the issuance of senior notes, the private sale of preferred stock, our initial and follow-on public stock offerings, our credit facility, our convertible secured notes, our combination with i-STT and Pihana, which brought additional cash into the combined company, and various types of debt facilities and capital lease obligations, for aggregate gross proceeds of $1.0 billion. As of December 31, 2003, our total indebtedness from our non-convertible debt was $68.3 million and our total indebtedness from our convertible debt was $43.6 million as outlined below. On February 11, 2004, we sold $75.0 million in aggregate principal of 2.5% convertible subordinated debentures due 2024 to qualified institutional buyers. Subsequently, on February 18, 2004, we sold an additional $11.25 million of our debentures to the initial purchasers of these debentures. We used or intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay all amounts outstanding under our credit facility and two of our other debt facilities. In addition, we intend to use the proceeds received to redeem our 13% senior notes. We have exercised our right to redeem all of its 13% senior notes, which have a total of $30.5 million of principal outstanding and have sent a notice of redemption to the trustee. The effective date of the redemption is expected to be March 12, 2004. The redemption price for the senior notes will be equal to 106.5% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Lastly, all remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. We expect to record a significant loss on debt extinguishment during the quarter ended March 31, 2004, primarily related to the non-cash write-off of debt issuance costs and discounts in connection with these various debt repayments and redemptions, as well as the cash premium we will pay on our 13% senior notes. We refer to this transaction as the “convertible debenture offering”. As of December 31, 2003, our principal source of liquidity was our $73.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We believe that this cash, coupled with the proceeds from the convertible debenture offering and our anticipated cash flows generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure, working capital, debt service, including repayments and redemptions of our non-convertible debt as planned, and corporate overhead requirements for at least the next 12 months. While we had generated negative operating cashflow in each annual period since inception, commencing the quarter ended September 30, 2003 we started to generate positive operating cash flow. During this quarter, our recurring revenues grew to a level sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements related to our predominantly fixed cost structure. We considered this quarter to be the inflection point in our business model whereby our revenues were sufficient on an ongoing basis to meet all our operating costs and working capital requirements. As a result of reaching this point in our operating history, we expect to generate cash from our operations during 2004 and expect these operating cash flows to be sufficient to meet our cash requirements to fund our capital expenditures. Given our limited operating history, we may not achieve our desired levels of profitability. See “Risk Factors.” Uses of Cash Net cash used in our operating activities was $17.3 million, $27.5 million and $68.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We used cash during these periods primarily to fund our net loss, including cash interest payments on our senior notes and credit facility, although the majority of the operating cash flows used in 2003 related to the liquidation of accrued obligations at December 31, 2002 28 Table of Contents attributed to the combination and financing transactions and restructuring activities. Our net cash used in operations has decreased each year as our revenues have grown. As described above, we expect that we will generate cash from our operating activities in 2004. Net cash used in investing activities was $15.6 million, $7.5 million and $153.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities in during the year ended December 31, 2003 was primarily to fund capital expenditures to support our growing customer base and the purchase of short-term investments. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2002 was primarily attributable to the liquidation of accrued construction costs for the New York metropolitan area IBX hub, which opened during the first quarter of 2002, partially offset by the sale of short-term investments. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2001 was primarily attributable to the construction of our IBX hubs and the purchase of restricted cash and short-term investments. The amount of cash used in investing activities has decreased substantially since 2001 as we have substantially completed our current IBX hub rollout plan. For 2004, we anticipate that our cash used in investing activities, excluding the purchase and sale of short-term investments, will be attributed to the funding of our capital expenditures. Net cash generated by financing activities was $52.3 million, $16.9 million and $107.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net cash generated by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2003 was primarily the result of the $104.4 million in proceeds from our follow-on equity offering and $10.0 million in proceeds from the Crosslink financing, partially offset by $57.2 million in payments on our credit facility and $6.1 million in payments on our various other debt facilities and capital lease obligations. Net cash generated by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2002 was primarily attributable to the cash acquired in the acquisitions of i-STT and Pihana and proceeds from our $30.0 million convertible secured notes, offset by payments of $17.7 million used to retire approximately $169.5 million of our senior notes and the costs associated with the exchange of the senior notes and repayments under our credit facility of $13.5 million. Net cash generated by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2001 was primarily attributable to the net $105.0 million draw down under our credit facility. Debt Obligations—Non-Convertible Debt As of December 31, 2003, our total indebtedness from non-convertible debt was $68.3 million, comprised of our senior notes, credit facility, and other debt facilities and capital lease obligations as follows: Senior Notes. In December 1999, we issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 13% senior notes due 2007. During 2002, we retired $169.5 million of the senior notes in exchange for approximately 2.4 million shares of common stock and approximately $21.3 million of cash. As of December 31, 2003, a total of $30.5 million of senior note principal remained outstanding, which is presented, net of unamortized discount, on our balance sheet at $29.2 million. In February 2004, with the net proceeds from our convertible debenture offering, we have exercised our right to redeem all of our senior notes. A notice has been sent to the trustee and the effective date of the redemption of our senior notes is expected to be March 12, 2004. The redemption price for the senior notes will be equal to 106.5% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Credit Facility. In December 2000, we entered into the credit facility with a syndicate of lenders under which, subject to our compliance with a number of financial ratios and covenants, we were permitted to borrow up to $150.0 million, which was fully drawn down during 2001. This facility was amended at various times during 2001 and 2002. In connection with the follow-on equity offering in November 2003, we entered into a further amendment to the credit facility and permanently repaid $55.2 million of the then outstanding principal balance of $90.5 million. As of December 31, 2003, a total of $34.3 million of principal remained outstanding under the credit facility. In February 2004, with the net proceeds from our convertible debenture offering, we repaid all amounts outstanding under our credit facility and terminated the credit facility. 29 Table of Contents Other Debt Facilities and Capital Lease Obligations. In August 1999, we entered into a loan agreement with Venture Lending and Leasing in the amount of $10.0 million and fully drew down on this amount. This loan agreement bears interest at 8.5% and was repayable over 42 months in equal monthly payments with a final interest payment equal to 15% of the advance amounts due on maturity. In October 2002, we amended the loan agreement to secure certain short-term cash deferment benefits. Under the terms of this amendment, we extended the maturity of the loan by 24 months and amortized the remaining principal balance and related balloon interest payment over this amended period ending March 1, 2005. In exchange, the Company issued new warrants and re-priced the original warrants. As of December 31, 2003, principal of $847,000 remained outstanding. In March 2004, with the net proceeds from our convertible debenture offering, we will pay off this other debt facility in full. In June 2001, we entered into a loan agreement with Heller Financial Leasing in the amount of $5.0 million and fully drew down on this amount. This loan agreement bears interest at 13.0% and is repayable over 36 months. In August 2002, we amended this loan to secure certain short-term cash deferments. Under the amended terms of this loan agreement, we extended the maturity of the loan by nine months. Commencing September 2002, we began to benefit from the reduction in monthly payments over the following 14 months thereby deferring approximately $1.2 million of principal payments. Commencing November 2003, the deferred principal payments will be repaid over the remaining 17 months of the loan ending March 2005. As of December 31, 2003, principal of $2.5 million remained outstanding. In February 2004, with the net proceeds from our convertible debenture offering, we paid off this other debt facility in full. In December 2002, in conjunction with our merger with Pihana, we acquired multiple capital leases with Orix. The original amount financed was approximately $3.5 million. These capital lease arrangements bear interest at an average rate of 6.4% per annum and are repayable over 30 months. As of December 31, 2003, principal of $201,000 remained outstanding. These capital leases will be fully paid down by March 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2003, a total of $3.5 million of our other debt facilities and capital lease obligations were outstanding, which is presented, net of unamortized discount, on our balance sheet at $3.4 million. Debt Obligations—Convertible Debt Convertible Secured Notes. In December 2002, in conjunction with the combination, STT Communications made a $30.0 million strategic investment in the company in the form of a 14% convertible secured note due November 2007. The interest on the convertible secured note is payable in kind in the form of additional convertible secured notes, which we refer to as “PIK notes”. During 2003, we issued $3.6 million in PIK notes. The convertible secured note and PIK notes issued to STT Communications are convertible into our preferred and common stock at a price of $9.18 per underlying share, which represents 3.7 million shares as of December 31, 2003, and are convertible anytime at the option of STT Communications. After December 31, 2004 and through December 31, 2005, we may convert 95% of the STT Communications’ convertible secured notes and after December 31, 2005, we may convert 100% of these convertible secured notes upon certain conditions, including if the closing price of our common stock exceeds $32.12 per share for thirty consecutive trading days. In June 2003, entities affiliated with Crosslink Capital made a $10.0 million strategic investment in the company in the form of 10% convertible secured notes due November 2007. The interest on the convertible secured notes is payable in kind in the form of additional convertible secured notes commencing on the second anniversary of the closing of this transaction. As of December 31, 2003, the convertible secured notes issued to the entities affiliated with Crosslink were convertible into 2.5 million shares of our common stock, and are convertible anytime at the option of Crosslink Capital. Following the second anniversary of the closing of the Crosslink financing, 100% of the Crosslink convertible secured notes will automatically convert upon certain conditions, including if the closing price of our common stock exceeds $15.66 per share for thirty consecutive trading days. We recorded a substantial debt discount equal to the $10.0 million of principal in connection with the Crosslink financing, primarily as a result of the beneficial conversion feature associated with these convertible secured notes, which is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Crosslink financing. 30 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2003, a total of $43.6 million of convertible secured notes were outstanding, which is presented, net of unamortized discount, on our balance sheet at $31.7 million. All interest expense associated with our convertible secured notes, including the amortization of the unamortized discount of $11.9 million, represents non-cash interest expense in our statements of operation and cash flow as no cash is expended for this interest. Convertible Subordinated Debentures. On February 11, 2004, we sold $75.0 million in aggregate principal of 2.5% convertible subordinated debentures due 2024 to qualified institutional buyers. Subsequently, on February 18, 2004, we sold an additional $11.25 million of our debentures to the initial purchasers of these debentures. We used the net proceeds from this offering to repay all amounts outstanding under our credit facility and two of our other debt facilities. In addition, we intend to use additional proceeds received to redeem our 13% senior notes. We have exercised our right to redeem all of its 13% senior notes, which have a total of $30.5 million of principal outstanding and have sent a notice of redemption to the trustee. The effective date of the redemption is expected to be March 12, 2004. Lastly, all remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes The interest on the convertible subordinated debentures is payable semi-annually every February and August commencing August 2004. Unlike our convertible secured notes, the interest on our convertible subordinated debentures will be payable in cash. Our convertible subordinated debentures will be convertible into 2.2 million shares of our common stock. Holders of the convertible subordinated debentures may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on February 15, 2009, February 15, 2014 and February 15, 2019, in each case at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, holders of the convertible subordinated debentures may convert their debentures into shares of our common stock upon certain defined circumstances, including during any calendar quarter after the quarter ending June 30, 2004 if the closing price of our common stock exceeds $47.40 per share for twenty consecutive trading days. We may redeem all or a portion of the debentures at any time after February 15, 2009 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Debt Maturities and Operating Lease Commitments We lease our IBX hubs and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating lease agreements expiring through 2020. The following represents the minimum future operating lease payments for these commitments, as well as the combined aggregate maturities for all of our debt as of December 31, 2003 (in thousands): Debt facilities &capital leaseobligations Creditfacility Seniornotes Convertiblesecurednotes Operatingleases Total 2004 $ 2,798 $ 12,000 $ — $ — $ 28,339 $ 43,137 2005 729 12,000 — — 31,072 43,801 2006 — 10,281 — — 31,900 42,181 2007 — — 30,475 43,598 32,330 106,403 2008 and thereafter — — — — 232,943 232,943 $ 3,527 $ 34,281 $ 30,475 $ 43,598 $ 356,584 $ 468,465 31 Table of Contents If the Company had completed the convertible subordinated debenture offering during 2003 instead of February 2004, and had used the proceeds from this offering to repay all amounts outstanding under our credit facility and two of our other debt facilities, as well as redeemed all remaining senior notes, as intended, the obligations presented above would have been as follows on a pro forma basis as of December 31, 2003 (in thousands): Debt facilities &capital leaseobligations Convertiblesecured notes Convertiblesubordinateddebentures Operatingleases Total 2004 $ 201 $ — $ — $ 28,339 $ 28,540 2005 — — — 31,072 31,072 2006 — — — 31,900 31,900 2007 — 43,598 — 32,330 75,928 2008 and thereafter — — 86,250 232,943 319,193 $ 201 $ 43,598 $ 86,250 $ 356,584 $ 486,633 As of December 31, 2003, we had capital expenditure commitments of approximately $1.0 million related to a small expansion of our Singapore IBX hub, which we expect to fund during the first half of 2004. In addition, we expect to spend approximately $3.0 to $5.0 million to bring our recently-acquired Santa Clara IBX hub to Equinix standards during the first half of 2004. With respect to the operating lease for one of our New York metropolitan area IBXs, our landlord has the right to increase our rentable space on December 31, 2004 when the lease for the current tenant’s portion of the aggregate property lease expires. As a result, commencing fiscal 2005, our total rent expense associated with this IBX hub could double. This increase in our operating lease commitments is reflected in the tables presented above. We are currently working with this landlord, as well as the current tenant of that space, and expect to minimize this additional cost to us; however, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in reducing this commitment. Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and service streams, such as our recent acquisition of the Sprint property in Santa Clara. However, we will continue to be very selective with any similar opportunity. As was the case with the Sprint property, the criteria will be quality of the design, access to networks, capacity availability in current market location, amount of incremental investment in the targeted property, lead-time to breakeven and in-place customers. Like the Sprint property, the right combination of these factors may be quite attractive for us. Dependent on the particular deal, these acquisitions may require additional capital expenditures in order to bring these centers up to Equinix standards. 32 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business and us: Risks Related to Our Business We have a limited operating history and we face challenges typically experienced by early-stage companies. We were founded in June 1998 and did not recognize any revenue until November 1999. In October 2002, we entered into agreements to consummate a series of related acquisition and financing transactions. These transactions closed on December 31, 2002. Under the terms of these agreements, we combined our business with two similar businesses, that of i-STT Pte Ltd, or i-STT, and Pihana Pacific, Inc., or Pihana. We refer to this transaction as the combination. i-STT was founded in January 2000 and did not recognize any revenue until May 2000. Pihana was founded in June 1999 and did not recognize any revenue until June 2000. We expect that we will encounter challenges and difficulties frequently experienced by early-stage companies in new and rapidly evolving international markets, such as our ability to generate cash flow, hire, train and retain sufficient operational and technical talent, and implement our plan with minimal delays. We may not successfully address any or all of these challenges and our failure to do so would seriously harm our business plan and operating results, and affect our ability to raise additional funds. Equinix’s, i-STT’s and Pihana’s businesses have incurred substantial losses in the past, may continue to incur additional losses in the future and will not be profitable until the combined company reverses this trend. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the combined company incurred losses of $84.2 million. Until the quarter ended September 30, 2003, the combined company did not generate cash from operations. There can be no guarantee that the combined company will become profitable and the combined company may continue to incur additional losses. Even if the combined company achieves profitability, given the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which it operates, the combined company may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. We expect our operating results to fluctuate. Equinix has experienced fluctuations in its results of operations on a quarterly and annual basis. The fluctuation in our operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We expect to experience significant fluctuations in our operating results in the foreseeable future due to a variety of factors, including: • acquisition of additional IBX hubs; • demand for space and services at our IBX hubs; • changes in general economic conditions and specific market conditions in the telecommunications and Internet industries; • the provision of customer discounts and credits; • the mix of current and proposed products and services and the gross margins associated with our products and services; • competition in the markets; • conditions related to international operations; • the operating costs attributable to our real and personal property tax obligations related to our IBX hubs; 33 Table of Contents • potential impairment charges on our long-lived assets including property and equipment and goodwill if certain of our IBX hub markets do not meet performance expectations; • the timing and magnitude of operating expenses, capital expenditures and expenses related to the expansion of sales, marketing, operations and acquisitions, if any, of complementary businesses and assets; and • the cost and availability of adequate public utilities, including power. Any of the foregoing factors, or other factors discussed elsewhere in this offering memorandum, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Although the combined company has experienced growth in revenues in recent quarters, this growth rate is not necessarily indicative of future operating results. It is possible that the combined company may never generate net income on a quarterly or annual basis. In addition, a relatively large portion of our expenses are fixed in the short-term, particularly with respect to lease and personnel expenses, depreciation and amortization, and interest expenses. Therefore, our results of operations are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenues. As such, comparisons to prior reporting periods should not be relied upon as indications of the combined company’s future performance. In addition, our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, we could experience an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our stock. Our inability to use our tax net operating losses will cause us to pay taxes at an earlier date and in greater amounts which may harm our operating results. We believe that our ability to use our tax net operating losses, or NOLs, in any taxable year is subject to limitation under Section 382 of the Code as a result of the significant change in the ownership of our stock that resulted from the combination. We expect that almost all of our NOLs accrued prior to December 31, 2002 will expire unused as a result of this limitation. In addition to the limitations on NOL carryforward utilization described above, we believe that Section 382 of the Code will also significantly limit our ability to use the depreciation and amortization on our assets, as well as certain losses on the sale of our assets, to the extent that such depreciation, amortization and losses reflect unrealized depreciation that was inherent in such assets as of the date of the combination. These limitations will cause us to pay taxes at an earlier date and in greater amounts than would occur absent such limitations. If we cannot effectively integrate and manage international operations, our revenues may not increase and our business and results of operations would be harmed. In 2002, our sales outside North America represented less than 1% of our revenues, i-STT’s sales outside North America represented approximately 100% of its revenues and Pihana’s sales outside North America represented approximately 45% of its revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the combined company recognized 15% of its revenues outside North America. We anticipate that, for the foreseeable future, approximately 15% of the combined company’s revenues will be derived from sources outside North America. Our management team is comprised primarily of Equinix executives before the combination, some of whom have had limited or no experience overseeing international operations. To date, the neutrality of the Equinix IBX hubs and the variety of networks available to our customers has often been a competitive advantage for us. In certain of our recently acquired IBX hubs, in Singapore in particular, the limited number of carriers available diminishes that advantage. As a result, we may need to adapt our key revenue-generating services and pricing to be competitive in that market. We may experience gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. To date, the majority of Equinix’s revenues and costs have been denominated in U.S. dollars, the majority of i-STT’s revenues and costs have been denominated in Singapore dollars and the majority of Pihana’s revenues and costs have been denominated in U.S. dollars, Japanese yen and Australian, Hong Kong and Singapore dollars. Although 34 Table of Contents the combined company may undertake foreign exchange hedging transactions to reduce foreign currency transaction exposure, it does not currently intend to eliminate all foreign currency transaction exposure. Where our prices are denominated in U.S. dollars, our sales could be adversely affected by declines in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, thereby making our products more expensive in local currencies. Our international operations are generally subject to a number of additional risks, including: • costs of customizing IBX hubs for foreign countries; • protectionist laws and business practices favoring local competition; • greater difficulty or delay in accounts receivable collection; • difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; • political and economic instability; • ability to obtain, transfer, or maintain licenses required by governmental entities with respect to the combined business; and • compliance with governmental regulation with which we have little experience. We may make acquisitions, which pose integration and other risks, that could harm our business. We may seek to acquire additional IBX centers, complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. As a result of these acquisitions, we may be required to incur additional debt and expenditures and issue additional shares of our stock to pay for the acquired business, product, service or technology, which will dilute existing stockholders’ ownership interest in the combined company and may delay, or prevent, our profitability. These acquisitions may also expose us to risks such as: • the possibility that we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses or achieve the level of quality in such businesses to which our customers are accustomed; • the possibility that senior management may be required to spend considerable time negotiating agreements and integrating acquired businesses; and • the possible loss or reduction in value of acquired businesses. On October 27, 2003, we announced that we signed an agreement to sublease Sprint’s E|Solutions Internet Center in Santa Clara and acquire certain related assets. Such sublease went into effect on December 1, 2003. In negotiating this transaction we were only able to conduct limited due diligence and received limited representations and warranties. If the subleased facility and acquired assets are not in the condition we believe them to be in, we may be required to incur substantial additional costs to repair the acquired facility and related assets. If incurred, these costs could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we would successfully overcome these risks or any other problems encountered with these acquisitions. STT Communications holds a substantial portion of our stock and has significant influence over matters requiring stockholder consent. As of December 31, 2003, STT Communications owned approximately 28.5% of our outstanding voting stock. In addition, STT Communications is not prohibited from buying shares of our stock in public or private transactions. Because of the diffuse ownership of our stock, STT Communications has significant influence over matters requiring our stockholder approval. Following the expiration on December 31, 2004 of restrictions on STT Communications preventing it from converting its convertible secured notes and warrants into more than 40% of our voting stock, STT Communications may own more than 40% of our voting stock. As a result, STT 35 Table of Contents Communications will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, which could prevent or delay a third party from acquiring or merging with us. STT also has a right of first offer which entitles them to participate in an offering of our equity securities, or securities convertible into our equity securities, to maintain their ownership percentage prior to such offering. We may be forced to take steps, and may be prevented from pursuing certain business opportunities, to ensure compliance with certain tax-related covenants agreed to by us in the combination agreement. We agreed to a covenant in the combination agreement (which we refer to as the FIRPTA covenant) that we would use all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that at all times from and after the closing of the combination until such time as neither STT Communications nor its affiliates hold our capital stock or debt securities (or the capital stock received upon conversion of the debt securities) received by STT Communications in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the combination agreement, none of our capital stock issued to STT Communications would constitute “United States real property interests” within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the Code. Under Section 897(c) of the Code, our capital stock issued to STT Communications would generally constitute “United States real property interests” at such point in time that the fair market value of the “United States real property interests” owned by us equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the aggregate fair market values of (a) our “United States real property interests,” (b) our interests in real property located outside the U.S., and (c) any other assets held by us which are used or held for use in our trade or business. Given that we currently own significant amounts of “United States real property interests,” we may be limited with respect to the business opportunities we may pursue, particularly if the business opportunities would increase the amounts of “United States real property interests” owned by us or decrease the amount of other assets owned by us. In addition, pursuant to the FIRPTA covenant we may be forced to take commercially reasonable proactive steps to ensure our compliance with the FIRPTA covenant, including, but not limited to, (a) a sale-leaseback transaction with respect to all real property interests, or (b) the formation of a holding company organized under the laws of the Republic of Singapore which would issue shares of its capital stock in exchange for all of our outstanding stock (this reorganization would require the submission of that transaction to our stockholders for their approval and the consummation of that exchange). We will only be required to take these actions if such actions are commercially reasonable for Equinix or our stockholders. Our non-U.S. customers include numerous related parties of i-STT. In the past, a substantial portion of i-STT’s financing, as well as its revenues, has been derived from its affiliates, including STT Communications. We continue to have contractual and other business relationships and may engage in material transactions with affiliates of STT Communications. Circumstances may arise in which the interests of STT Communications’ affiliates may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. In addition, Singapore Technologies Pte Ltd, the parent company of STT Communications, makes investments in various companies; it has invested in the past, and may invest in the future, in entities that compete with us. In the context of negotiating commercial arrangements with affiliates, conflicts of interest have arisen in the past and may arise, in this or other contexts, in the future. We cannot assure you that any conflicts of interest will be resolved in our favor. A significant number of shares of our capital stock have been issued during 2002 and 2003 and may be sold in the market in the near future. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well. We issued a large number of shares of our capital stock to the former Pihana stockholders, STT Communications, and holders of our senior notes in connection with the combination, financing and senior note exchange, to Crosslink Capital in connection with the Crosslink financing and to the public and STT Communications in connection with our recent follow-on equity offering. The shares of common stock issued in the senior note exchange are currently freely tradeable. The shares of common stock issued in connection with 36 Table of Contents the combination have been registered for resale as of June 30, 2003 and the shares of common stock issued upon exercise of the warrants issued in connection with the Crosslink financing have been registered for resale as of September 22, 2003. The shares sold to the public and STT Communications in connection with our recent follow-on equity offering are freely tradeable by the public, subject, in the case of STT Communications, to compliance with Rule 144 resale restrictions applicable to affiliates. Subject to the restrictions described in our proxy statement dated December 12, 2002, the convertible secured notes and warrants issued in connection with the financing and the Crosslink financing are immediately convertible or exercisable into shares of common stock and the underlying shares of common stock may be registered for resale. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by these parties within any narrow period of time could cause our stock price to fall. In addition, the issuance of the additional shares of our common stock as a result of these transactions will reduce our earnings per share, if any. This dilution could reduce the market price of our common stock unless and until we achieve revenue growth or cost savings and other business economies sufficient to offset the effect of this issuance. We cannot assure you that we will achieve revenue growth, cost savings or other business economies. A significant number of our shares may be sold into the public market if STT Communications defaults on its credit facility which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly. STT Communications currently holds our common stock or holds securities convertible into shares of our common stock totaling 8,565,520 shares. STT Communications has pledged to its lenders its ownership interest in the majority of its secured notes and warrants purchased in the financing and its common and preferred stock issued in the combination as collateral for its secured credit facility. If STT Communications defaults on its credit facility, the stock, warrants and secured notes owned by STT Communications could be transferred to its lenders or sold to third parties. In the event of default, the new owner of the secured notes and warrants could convert them into our common stock and sell them, along with the common stock, into the public market. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by these parties within any narrow period of time could cause our stock price to fall. In addition, the issuance of the additional shares of our common stock as a result of these transactions will reduce our earnings per share, if any. We depend on a number of third parties to provide Internet connectivity to our IBX hubs; if connectivity is interrupted or terminated, our operating results and cash flow will be materially adversely affected. The presence of diverse telecommunications carriers’ fiber networks in our IBX hubs is critical to our ability to attract new customers. We believe that the availability of carrier capacity will directly affect our ability to achieve our projected results. We are not a telecommunications carrier, and as such we rely on third parties to provide our customers with carrier services. We rely primarily on revenue opportunities from the telecommunications carriers’ customers to encourage them to invest the capital and operating resources required to build facilities from their locations to our IBX hubs. Carriers will likely evaluate the revenue opportunity of an IBX hub based on the assumption that the environment will be highly competitive. We cannot assure you that any carrier will elect to offer its services within our IBX hubs or that once a carrier has decided to provide Internet connectivity to our IBX hubs that it will continue to do so for any period of time. The construction required to connect multiple carrier facilities to our IBX hubs is complex and involves factors outside of our control, including regulatory processes and the availability of construction resources. If the establishment of highly diverse Internet connectivity to our IBX hubs does not occur or is materially delayed or is discontinued, our operating results and cash flow will be adversely affected. Further, many carriers are experiencing business difficulties. As a result, some carriers may be forced to terminate connectivity within our IBX hubs. 37 Table of Contents Any failure of our physical infrastructure or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce our revenue and harm our business reputation and financial results. Our business depends on providing customers with highly reliable service. We must protect customers’ IBX infrastructure and customers’ equipment located in our IBX hubs. The services we provide are subject to failure resulting from numerous factors, including: • human error; • physical or electronic security breaches; • fire, earthquake, flood and other natural disasters; • water damage; • power loss; • sabotage and vandalism; and • failure of business partners who provide the combined company’s resale products. Problems at one or more of our IBX hubs, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions or significant equipment damage. We have service level commitment obligations to certain of our customers. As a result, service interruptions or significant equipment damage in our IBX hubs could result in service level commitments to these customers. In the past, a limited number of our customers have experienced temporary losses of power and failure of our services levels on products such as bandwidth connectivity. If we incur significant financial commitments to our customers in connection with a loss of power, or our failure to meet other service level commitment obligations, our liability insurance may not be adequate to cover those expenses. In addition, any loss of services, equipment damage or inability to meet our service level commitment obligations, particularly in the early stage of our development, could reduce the confidence of our customers and could consequently impair our ability to obtain and retain customers, which would adversely affect both our ability to generate revenues and our operating results. Furthermore, we are dependent upon Internet service providers, telecommunications carriers and other website operators in the U.S., Asia and elsewhere, some of which may have experienced significant system failures and electrical outages in the past. Users of our services may in the future experience difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems and services. If for any reason, these providers fail to provide the required services, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. A portion of the managed services business we acquired in the combination involves the processing and storage of confidential customer information. Inappropriate use of those services could jeopardize the security of customers’ confidential information causing losses of data or financially impacting us or our customers. Efforts to alleviate problems caused by computer viruses or other inappropriate uses or security breaches may lead to interruptions, delays or cessation of our managed services. There is no known prevention or defense against denial of service attacks. During a prolonged denial of service attack, Internet service will not be available for several hours, thus impacting hosted customers’ on-line business transactions. Affected customers might file claims against us under such circumstances. Our business could be harmed by prolonged electrical power outages or shortages, increased costs of energy or general availability of electrical resources. Our IBX hubs are susceptible to regional costs of power, electrical power shortages, planned or unplanned power outages caused by these shortages such as those that occurred in California during 2001 and in the Northeast in 2003, and limitations, especially internationally, of adequate power resources. The overall power shortage in California has increased the cost of energy, which we may not be able to pass on to our customers. 38 Table of Contents We attempt to limit exposure to system downtime by using backup generators and power supplies. Power outages, which last beyond our backup and alternative power arrangements, could harm our customers and our business. We resell products and services of third parties that may require us to pay for such services even if our customers fail to pay us for the services which may have a negative impact on our operating results. In order to provide resale services such as bandwidth, managed services, backup and recovery services and other network management services, we will contract with third party service providers. These services require us to enter into fixed term contracts for services with third party suppliers of products and services. If we experience the loss of a customer who has purchased a resale product, we will remain obligated to continue to pay our suppliers for the term of the underlying contracts. The payment of these obligations without a corresponding payment from customers will reduce our financial resources and may have a material adverse affect on our financial performance and operating results. IBM accounts for a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of IBM as a customer could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2003, IBM accounted for 15% of our revenue and as of December 31, 2003 accounted for 11% of our accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2002, IBM accounted for 20% of our revenue and as of December 31, 2002 accounted for 15% of our accounts receivable. We expect that IBM will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future, although we expect revenues received from IBM to decline as a percentage of our total revenues as we add new customers in our IBX hubs. If we lose IBM as a customer, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Our IBX hubs and other products and services must be able to differentiate themselves from existing providers of space and services for telecommunications companies, web hosting companies and other colocation providers. In addition to competing with neutral colocation providers, we must compete with traditional colocation providers, including local phone companies, long distance phone companies, Internet service providers and web hosting facilities. Likewise, with respect to our other products and services, including managed services, bandwidth services and security services, we must compete with more established providers of similar services. Most of these companies have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than us. Because of their greater financial resources, some of our competitors have the ability to adopt aggressive pricing policies, especially if they have been able to restructure their debt or other obligations. As a result, in the future, we may suffer from pricing pressure that would adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, these competitors could offer colocation on neutral terms, and may start doing so in the same metropolitan areas where we have IBX hubs. Some of these competitors may also provide our target customers with additional benefits, including bundled communication services, and may do so in a manner that is more attractive to our potential customers than obtaining space in our IBX hubs. We believe our neutrality provides us with an advantage over these competitors. However, if these competitors were able to adopt aggressive pricing policies together with offering colocation space, our ability to generate revenues would be materially adversely affected. We may also face competition from persons seeking to replicate our IBX concept by building new centers or converting existing centers that some of our competitors are in the process of divesting. Competitors may operate more successfully or form alliances to acquire significant market share. Furthermore, enterprises that have already invested substantial resources in peering arrangements may be reluctant or slow to adopt our approach that may replace, limit or compete with their existing systems. In addition, other companies may be able to attract 39 Table of Contents the same potential customers that we are targeting. Once customers are located in competitors’ facilities, it will be extremely difficult to convince them to relocate to our IBX hubs. Because we depend on the development and growth of a balanced customer base, failure to attract and retain this base of customers could harm our business and operating results. Our ability to maximize revenues depends on our ability to develop and grow a balanced customer base, consisting of a variety of companies, including network service providers, site and performance management companies, and enterprise and content companies. The more balanced the customer base within each IBX hub, the better we will be able to generate significant interconnection revenues, which in turn increases our overall revenues. Our ability to attract customers to our IBX hubs will depend on a variety of factors, including the presence of multiple carriers, the mix of products and services offered by us, the overall mix of customers, the IBX hub’s operating reliability and security and our ability to effectively market our services. In addition, some of our customers are and will continue to be Internet companies that face many competitive pressures and that may not ultimately be successful. If these customers do not succeed, they will not continue to use the IBX hubs. This may be disruptive to our business and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Increases in property taxes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our IBX hubs are subject to state and local real property taxes. The state and local real property taxes on our IBX hubs may increase as property tax rates change and as the value of the properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities. Many state and local governments are facing budget deficits, which may cause them to increase assessments or taxes. If property taxes increase, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. Our products and services have a long sales cycle that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A customer’s decision to license cabinet space in one of our IBX hubs and to purchase additional services typically involves a significant commitment of resources and will be influenced by, among other things, the customer’s confidence in our financial strength. In addition, some customers will be reluctant to commit to locating in our IBX hubs until they are confident that the IBX hub has adequate carrier connections. As a result, we have a long sales cycle. Delays due to the length our sales cycle may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to securities class action litigation, which may harm our business and results of operations. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. During the quarter ended September 30, 2001, putative shareholder class action lawsuits were filed against us, a number of our officers and directors, and several investment banks that were underwriters of our initial public offering. The suits allege that the underwriter defendants agreed to allocate stock in our initial public offering to certain investors in exchange for excessive and undisclosed commissions and agreements by those investors to make additional purchases in the aftermarket at pre-determined prices. Plaintiffs allege that the prospectus for our initial public offering was false and misleading and in violation of the securities laws because it did not disclose these arrangements. In July 2003, a special litigation committee of our board of directors agreed to participate in a settlement with the plaintiffs. The settlement agreement is subject to court approval and sufficient participation by defendants in similar actions. If the proposed settlement is not approved by the court or a sufficient number of defendants do not participate in the settlement, the defense of this litigation may increase our expenses and divert management’s attention and resources. An adverse outcome in this litigation could seriously harm our business and results of operations. In addition, we may, in the future, be subject to other securities class action or similar litigation. 40 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Industry If the economy does not improve and the use of the Internet and electronic business does not grow, our revenues may not grow. Acceptance and use of the Internet may not continue to develop at historical rates and a sufficiently broad base of consumers may not adopt or continue to use the Internet and other online services as a medium of commerce. Demand for Internet services and products are subject to a high level of uncertainty and are subject to significant pricing pressure, especially in Asia-Pacific. As a result, we cannot be certain that a viable market for our IBX hubs will materialize. If the market for our IBX hubs grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, our revenues will not grow as expected and our operating results will suffer. Government regulation may adversely affect the use of the Internet and our business. Various laws and governmental regulations governing Internet related services, related communications services and information technologies, and electronic commerce remain largely unsettled, even in areas where there has been some legislative action. This is true both in the U.S. and the various foreign countries in which we now operate. It may take years to determine whether and how existing laws, such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel, telecommunications services, and taxation, apply to the Internet and to related services such as ours. We have limited experience with such international regulatory issues and substantial resources may be required to comply with regulations or bring any non-compliant business practices into compliance with such regulations. In addition, the development of the market for online commerce and the displacement of traditional telephony service by the Internet and related communications services may prompt an increased call for more stringent consumer protection laws or other regulation both in the U.S. and abroad that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online and their service providers. The compliance with, adoption or modification of, laws or regulations relating to the Internet, or interpretations of existing laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Terrorist activity throughout the world and military action to counter terrorism could adversely impact our business. The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the U.S., the ensuing declaration of war on terrorism and the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility appear to be having an adverse effect on business, financial and general economic conditions internationally. These effects may, in turn, increase our costs due to the need to provide enhanced security, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. These circumstances may also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, our ability to raise capital and the operation and maintenance of our IBX hubs. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,” or EITF 00-21. EITF 00-21 provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF 00-21 apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. We adopted the provisions of EITF 00-21 during the third quarter of 2003. The adoption of this statement has not had a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, or FIN 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51.” FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB 41 Table of Contents released a revised version of FIN 46 clarifying certain aspects of FIN 46 and providing certain entities with exemptions from the requirements of FIN 46. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period ending after March 15, 2004. The adoption of Fin 46 did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. The new guidance amends SFAS No. 133 for decisions made as part of the Derivatives Implementation Group, or DIG, process that effectively required amendments to SFAS No. 133, and decisions made in connection with other FASB projects dealing with financial instruments and in connection with implementation issues raised in relation to the application of the definition of a derivative and characteristics of a derivative that contains financing components. In addition, it clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows. SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 149 during the third quarter of 2003. The adoption of this statement has not had a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances) because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer. In November 2003, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FASB 150-3 which deferred the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 150 indefinitely for certain mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interests that were issued before November 5, 2003. The FASB plans to reconsider implementation issues and, perhaps, classification or measurement guidance for those non-controlling interests during the deferral period. In 2003, we applied certain disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 150. To date, the impact of the effective provisions of SFAS No. 150 have not had a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. While the effective date of certain elements of SFAS No. 150 have been deferred, the adoption of SFAS No. 150 when finalized is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk The following discussion about market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent we are exposed to fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity. In the past, we have employed foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging certain specifically identified net currency exposures. The use of these financial instruments was intended to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, but does not eliminate such risks. We may decide to employ such contracts again in the future. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. Our interest income is impacted by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly since 42 Table of Contents the majority of our investments are in short-term instruments. Due to the short-term nature of our investments, we do not believe that we are subject to any material market risk exposure. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our investment portfolio. We would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be significantly affected by a sudden change in market interest rates in our investment portfolio. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates would furthermore not have a material impact to our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of our long-term debt obligations, except for the interest expense associated with our credit facility, which bears interest at floating rates, plus applicable margins, based on either the prime rate or LIBOR. As of December 31, 2003, the credit facility had an effective interest rate of 5.96%. Our credit facility was fully paid off in February 2004 with the proceeds from the convertible debenture offering. The fair market value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate changes may affect the fair market value of the fixed interest rate debt but does not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair market value of our senior notes is based on quoted market prices. The estimated fair value of our senior notes as of December 31, 2003 was approximately $24.4 million. Our senior notes will be fully redeemed in March 2004 with the proceeds from the convertible debenture offering. Foreign Currency Risk Prior to December 31, 2002, all of our recognized revenue had been denominated in U.S. dollars, generated mostly from customers in the U.S., and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had been minimal. However, commencing in fiscal 2003, as a result of the combination, approximately 15% of our revenues and approximately 18% of our costs were in the Asia-Pacific region, and a large portion of those revenues and costs were denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Singapore dollar, Japanese yen and Hong Kong and Australian dollars. As a result, our operating results and cash flows will be impacted due to currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. Going forward, we continue to expect that approximately 15% of our revenues and costs will continue to be generated and incurred in the Asia-Pacific region in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, similar to 2003. Furthermore, to the extent that our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our services less competitive in the international markets. Although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations, and when appropriate, may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations, there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future. Commodity Price Risk Certain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of significant price changes are electricity and supplies and equipment used in our IBX hubs. We are closely monitoring the cost of electricity, particularly in California. We do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk. 43 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:27:55.405840
1101239,EQIX,EQUINIX INC,2005,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information in this discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements are based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. For example, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Risk Factors” below. All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Overview Equinix provides network neutral colocation, interconnection and managed services to enterprises, content companies and systems integrators and the world’s largest networks. Through our 15 IBX centers in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific, customers can directly interconnect with each other for critical traffic exchange requirements. As of December 31, 2004, we had IBX centers totaling an aggregate of approximately 1.4 million gross square feet in the Chicago, Dallas, Honolulu, Los Angeles, New York, Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. areas in the United States and Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo in the Asia-Pacific region. In our IBX centers, customers can directly interconnect with each other for critical traffic exchange requirements. Direct interconnection to our aggregation of networks, which serve more than 90% of the world’s Internet routes, allows our customers to increase performance while significantly reducing costs. Based on our network neutral model and the quality of our IBX centers, we believe we have established a critical mass of customers comprised of networks, content providers and other enterprise companies. As more customers locate in our IBX centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to do so as well to gain the full economic and performance benefits of direct interconnection. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a “network effect” of customer adoption. Our interconnection services enable scalable, reliable and cost-effective interconnection and traffic exchange thus lowering overall cost and increasing flexibility. This critical mass of customers and the resulting network effect, combined with our improved financial position achieved through the completion of a series of financing transactions has resulted in an acceleration of new customer growth and related revenue bookings. Our current financial stability and focused business model have been important factors in this acceleration, both from new and existing customers. While we had generated negative operating cashflow in each annual period since inception through the quarter ended June 30, 2003, commencing the quarter ended September 30, 2003 we started to generate positive operating cash flow. During this quarter, our revenues grew to a level sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements for our predominantly fixed cost structure related to our existing IBX centers. We considered this quarter to be the inflection point in our business model whereby our revenues were sufficient, on an ongoing basis, to meet all our operating costs and working capital requirements. Given a large component of our cost of revenues related to our existing IBX centers are fixed in nature, we anticipate any growth in revenues will have a significant incremental flow-through to gross profit. Since reaching this point in our operating history, we have consistently generated operating cashflows for the past six quarters and we continue to expect to generate operating cash flows in 2005 and beyond at levels sufficient to meet our cash requirements to fund our capital expenditures, debt service and corporate overhead requirements. Historically, our market has been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled their telecommunication products and services with their colocation offerings. During 2003, a number of these 17 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements telecommunication carriers reduced their colocation footprint as they exited under-performing markets. In addition, one major telecommunications company, Sprint, announced their plans to exit the colocation and hosting market in order to focus on their core service offerings, while another telecommunications company, Cable & Wireless Plc, sold their U.S. assets to another telecommunications company, Savvis Communications Corp, in a bankruptcy auction. Each of these colocation providers owns and operates a network. We do not own or operate a network, yet have greater than 200 networks operating out of our IBX centers. As a result, we are able to offer our customers a substantial choice of networks given our network neutrality thereby allowing our customers to choose from numerous network service providers. We believe this is a distinct and sustainable competitive advantage, especially when the telecommunications industry is experiencing many business challenges and changes as evidenced by the numerous bankruptcies and consolidations within this industry during the past several years. Furthermore, for those customers who do require a more fully managed solution, certain of our other customers, such as IBM and EDS, can provide such a solution within our network rich IBX centers. Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and service streams, such as our acquisition of the Sprint property in Santa Clara in December 2003 and our 2004 expansions in the Washington, D.C. and Silicon Valley area markets (see Recent Developments below). However, we will continue to be very selective with any similar opportunity. As was the case with these recent expansions in the Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. area markets, the criteria will be quality of the design, access to networks, capacity availability in current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to breakeven and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive for us. Dependent on the particular deal, these acquisitions may require upfront cash payments and additional capital expenditures in order to bring these centers up to Equinix standards. Recent Developments During February 2004, we sold $86.3 million in aggregate principal of 2.5% convertible subordinated debentures due 2024 to qualified institutional buyers. We refer to this transaction as the “convertible debenture offering.” We used the net proceeds from the convertible debenture offering primarily to repay all amounts outstanding under our credit facility and two of our other debt facilities. In addition, we used the proceeds received to redeem our 13% senior notes, which had a total of $30.5 million of principal outstanding. The effective date of the redemption was March 12, 2004. The redemption price for the senior notes was equal to 106.5% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. On March 26, 2004, holders of our 10% $10.0 million convertible secured notes issued in connection with the Crosslink financing, converted the $10.0 million of principal into 2.5 million shares of our common stock. We refer to this transaction as the “Crosslink conversion.” We recorded a significant loss on debt extinguishment and conversion totaling $16.2 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2004, primarily related to the non-cash write-off of debt issuance costs and discounts in connection with the various debt repayments, redemptions and conversions of the underlying debt facilities extinguished or converted, as well as the cash premium that we paid on our 13% senior notes. In April 2004, we entered into a long-term lease for a 95,000 square foot data center in the Washington, D.C. metro area. This data center is adjacent to the Company’s existing Washington D.C. metro area IBX. This lease includes the leasing of all of the IBX plant and machinery equipment located in the building. Both the building and equipment components of this lease are being accounted for as a capital lease. We took possession of this property during the fourth quarter of 2004, and as a result, recorded property and equipment assets, as well as a capital lease obligation, totaling $35.3 million. Payments under this lease, which commenced in November 2004, will be made through 2019 at an effective interest rate of 8.50% per annum. We intend to place customers in this center in 2005. 18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In December 2004, we entered into a long-term lease for a 103,000 square foot data center in the Silicon Valley area. This data center is close to our existing IBX centers in the Silicon Valley, and expands the global Equinix footprint to approximately 1.4 million square feet. This new lease will add an additional $34.2 million in cumulative monthly lease payments through 2020, commencing February 2005. We will take possession of this property during the first quarter of 2005. We currently intend to place customers in this data center in 2005. Concurrent with the signing of this lease, we also purchased the assets located in this data center and entered into an agreement to interconnect all three of our Silicon Valley IBX centers to each other through redundant dark fiber links managed by us. This will allow our customers to have access to all the networks and customers in each of the three Silicon Valley IBXs. We are currently evaluating the accounting treatment for this lease, and related agreements, and will have this evaluation completed in March 2005. In December 2004, in light of the availability of fully built-out data centers in select markets at costs significantly below those costs we would incur in building out new space, we made the decision to exit leases for excess space adjacent to one of our New York metro area IBXs, as well as space on the floor above our original Los Angeles IBX. As a result of our decision to exit these spaces, we recorded a restructuring charge totaling $17.7 million, which represents the present value of our estimated future cash payments, net of any estimated subrental income and expense, through the remainder of these lease terms, as well as the write-off of all remaining property and equipment attributed to the excess space on the floor above our Los Angeles IBX. We entered into a two-year sublease agreement for the excess space in the New York metro area and are currently evaluating opportunities related to our excess space in Los Angeles. In December 2004, we entered into a $25.0 million line of credit arrangement with Silicon Valley Bank that matures in December 2006. This facility is a $25.0 million revolving line of credit which, at our election, up to $10.0 million may be converted into a 24-month term loan, repayable in eight quarterly installments. We refer to this transaction as the “Silicon Valley Bank credit line.” Borrowings under the Silicon Valley Bank credit line bear interest at floating interest rates, plus applicable margins, based either on the prime rate or LIBOR. As of December 31, 2004, the Silicon Valley Bank credit line had an interest rate of 4.40% per annum; however, through the date of filing of this report on Form 10-K, we have not drawn down any amounts from this line of credit. The Silicon Valley Bank credit line also features sublimits, which allows us to issue letters of credit, enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and make advances for cash management services. Our utilization under any of these sublimits would have the effect of reducing the amount available for borrowing under the Silicon Valley Bank credit line during the period that such sublimits remain utilized and outstanding. As of December 31, 2004, we had utilized $3.2 million under the letters of credit sublimit with the issuance of three letters of credit and, as a result, reduced the amount of borrowings available to us from $25.0 million to $21.8 million. The Silicon Valley Bank credit line is secured by substantially all of our domestic assets and contains numerous covenants, including financial covenants, such as maintaining minimum cash balance levels and meeting minimum quarterly revenue targets, which we are in full compliance of. The Silicon Valley Bank credit line provides us with additional liquidity and financing flexibility. In January 2005, we converted 95% of the outstanding convertible secured notes and accrued and unpaid interest, held by STT Communications Ltd., into 4.1 million shares of our preferred stock, which was subsequently converted into 4.1 million shares of our common stock in February 2005. The remaining 5% of the convertible secured notes, totaling $1.9 million, that remain outstanding will be eligible for conversion by Equinix in early 2006 into approximately 250,000 shares (including anticipated interest expense to be incurred during 2005 and early 2006), provided that the closing price of our common stock exceeds $32.12 per share for thirty consecutive trading days. We refer to this transaction as the “STT convertible secured notes conversion.” The Combination, Financing, Senior Note Exchange and Crosslink Financing In October 2002, we entered into agreements to consummate a series of related acquisition and financing transactions. These transactions closed on December 31, 2002. Under the terms of these agreements, we combined our business with two similar businesses, that of i-STT Pte Ltd, or i-STT, and Pihana Pacific, Inc., or 19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Pihana. i-STT’s business was based in Singapore, with operations in Singapore and a joint venture in Thailand. Pihana’s business was based in Hawaii, with operations in Honolulu, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. In connection with the acquisition of i-STT and Pihana, we issued approximately 3.5 million shares of our common stock and approximately 1.9 million shares of our Series A preferred stock. We refer to this transaction as the “combination.” In conjunction with the combination, we issued to i-STT’s former parent company, STT Communications Ltd., or STT Communications, a $30.0 million convertible secured note in exchange for cash. We refer to this transaction as the “financing.” In connection with the combination and financing, we amended the terms of the indenture governing our senior notes and extinguished $116.8 million of our senior notes in exchange for a combination of 1.9 million shares of our common stock and $15.2 million of cash. We refer to this transaction as the “senior note exchange.” Because we extinguished the debt in the senior note exchange at a significant discount, we recognized a substantial gain on debt extinguishment during the fourth quarter of 2002. Furthermore, in conjunction with the combination, financing and senior note exchange, we amended our credit facility, and on December 31, 2002, we completed a 32 for 1 reverse stock split of our common stock in order to comply with Nasdaq initial listing requirements. Unless otherwise noted, all share and per share amounts in this Form 10-K have been adjusted to give effect to the reverse stock split. In April 2003, Equinix and certain of our subsidiaries and STT Communications entered into agreements with various entities affiliated with Crosslink Capital for a $10.0 million cash investment in Equinix in the form of additional convertible secured notes. This transaction closed in June 2003. We refer to this transaction as the “Crosslink financing.” Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: • Revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts; • Accounting for income taxes; • Estimated and contingent liabilities; • Accounting for property and equipment; • Impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill; • Accounting for leases and IBX acquisitions; • Accounting for restructuring charges; and • Accounting for stock-based compensation. Revenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We derive more than 90% of our revenues from recurring revenue streams, consisting primarily of (1) colocation services, such as from the licensing of 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements cabinet space and power; (2) interconnection services, such as cross connects and Gigabit Ethernet ports and (3) managed infrastructure services, such as Equinix Direct, bandwidth and other e-business services such as mail service and managed platform solutions. The remainder of our revenues are from non-recurring revenue streams, such as from the recognized portion of deferred installation revenues, professional services, contract settlements and equipment sales. Revenues from recurring revenue streams are billed monthly and recognized ratably over the term of the contract, generally one to three years. Fees for the provision of e-business services are recognized progressively as the services are rendered in accordance with the contract terms, except where the future costs cannot be estimated reliably, in which case fees are recognized upon the completion of services. Non-recurring installation fees, although generally paid in a lump sum upon installation, are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the related contract or expected customer relationship. Professional service fees are recognized in the period in which the services were provided and represent the culmination of the earnings process as long as they meet the criteria for separate recognition under EITF Abstract No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” Revenue from bandwidth and equipment is recognized on a gross basis in accordance with EITF Abstract No. 99-19, “Recording Revenue as a Principal versus Net as an Agent”, primarily because we act as the principal in the transaction, take title to products and services and bear inventory and credit risk. To the extent we do not meet the criteria for gross basis accounting for bandwidth and equipment revenue, we record the revenue on a net basis. Revenue from contract settlements is recognized on a cash basis when no remaining performance obligations exist to the extent that the revenue has not previously been recognized. We occasionally guarantee certain service levels, such as uptime, as outlined in individual customer contracts. To the extent that these service levels are not achieved, we reduce revenue for any credits given to the customer as a result. We generally have the ability to determine such service level credits prior to the associated revenue being recognized, and historically, these credits have not been significant. Revenue is recognized only when the service has been provided and when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured. It is customary business practice to obtain a signed master sales agreement and sales order prior to recognizing revenue in an arrangement. We assess collection based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the credit-worthiness of the customer. We generally do not request collateral from our customers, although in certain cases we obtain a security interest in a customer’s equipment placed in our IBX centers or obtain a deposit. If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured, we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. In addition, we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments for those customers that we had expected to collect the revenues. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they become insolvent, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, allowances for doubtful accounts may be required. Management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and current economic news and trends, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating revenue recognition and the adequacy of our reserves. A specific bad debt reserve of up to the full amount of a particular invoice value is provided for certain problematic customer balances. A general reserve is established for all other accounts based on the age of the invoices. Delinquent account balances are written-off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable. Our customer base has historically been composed of businesses throughout the U.S. Commencing in the 2003 fiscal year our revenues included revenues from our newly-acquired Asia-Pacific operations. For the year ended December 31, 2003 our revenues were split approximately 85% in the U.S. and 15% in Asia-Pacific. For the year ended December 31, 2004 our revenues were split approximately 87% in the U.S. and 13% in Asia-Pacific. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers. As of December 31, 2004, one customer, IBM, accounted for 13% of annual revenues and 12% of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2003, this same customer accounted for 15% of annual revenues and 11% of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2002, this same customer accounted for 20% of annual revenues. No other single customer accounted for greater than 10% of accounts receivable or annual revenues for the periods presented. 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Accounting for Income Taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected more likely than not to be realized in the future. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including the forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning strategies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We also account for any income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies.” We currently have provided for a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. We have considered the positive and negative evidences affecting the assessment of a full valuation allowance. Based on the available objective evidence, management does not believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realizable in the future. Should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future, a reversed adjustment to the valuation allowance would benefit net income in the period such determination is made. In preparing the consolidated financial statement, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The determination of income taxes also involves estimating the impact of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations and uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations. Accruals for tax contingencies require management to estimate the actual outcome of any such audits and the impact of uncertainties. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Estimated and Contingent Liabilities. Management estimates exposure on certain liabilities and contingent liabilities, such as property taxes and litigation, based on the best information available at the time of determination. With respect to real and personal property taxes, management records what it can reasonably estimate based on prior payment history, current landlord estimates or estimates based on current or changing fixed asset values in each specific municipality, as applicable. However, there are circumstances beyond our control whereby the underlying value of the property or basis for which the tax is calculated on said property may change, such as a landlord selling the underlying property of one of our IBX center leases or a municipality changing the assessment value in a jurisdiction and, as a result, our property tax obligations may vary from period to period. Based upon the most current facts and circumstances, we make the necessary property tax accruals for each of our reporting periods. However, revisions in our estimates of the potential or actual liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position. For litigation claims, when management can reasonably estimate the range of loss and when an unfavorable outcome is probable, a contingent liability is recorded. For current legal proceedings, management believes that it has adequate legal defenses and that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, because of the uncertainties as to the outcome of these proceedings and since no range of loss can be estimated at this time, management has determined that no accrual is needed. As additional information becomes available, we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position. Accounting for Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are stated at original cost, or in the case of IBX centers that we acquire, at fair value at the time of acquisition. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally two to five years for non-IBX equipment and seven to twelve years for IBX equipment. Leasehold improvements and assets acquired under capital lease are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset or improvement. 22 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Should management determine that the actual useful lives of our property and equipment placed into service is less than originally anticipated, or if any of our property and equipment was deemed to have incurred an impairment, additional depreciation, or an impairment charge would be required, which would decrease net income in the period such determination was made. Conversely, should management determine that the actual useful lives of its property and equipment placed into service was greater than originally anticipated, less depreciation may be required, which would increase net income in the period such determination was made. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill. We account for the impairment of long-lived assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard, or SFAS, No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”, or in the case of goodwill, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” We evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived assets, consisting primarily of our IBX centers and goodwill, whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable or at least on an annual basis during the fourth quarter for goodwill. Such events or circumstances include, but are not limited to, a prolonged industry downturn, a significant decline in our market value or significant reductions in projected future cash flows. We currently operate in one reportable segment; however our goodwill is attributed solely to our Singapore reporting unit. Significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows, including profit margins, long-term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market, groupings of assets, discount rates and terminal growth rates. In addition, significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long-lived assets, including replacement cost, economic obsolescence, and the value that could be realized in orderly liquidation. Changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long-lived assets, thereby requiring us to write down the assets. Our net long-lived assets as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, included property and equipment of $343.4 million and $343.6 million, respectively, and goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets of $22.3 million and $23.5 million, respectively. Accounting for Leases and IBX acquisitions. We currently have 15 IBX centers in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific. Our current strategy has been to enter into long-term leases for our IBX centers rather than to purchase and own these properties. The majority of our IBX centers are accounted for as operating leases; however, in April 2004, we entered into a long-term lease for a 95,000 square foot data center in the Washington, D.C. metro area. This lease, which includes the leasing of all of the IBX plant and machinery equipment located in the building, is a capital lease. We account for leases in accordance with SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases.” Although we do not have title to any of the leased assets contained in our new Washington, D.C. metro area IBX, this lease qualified for capital lease treatment as a result of the present value of the minimum lease payments equaling or exceeding 90% of the fair value of the leased property. Our analysis of this lease required significant judgment and estimates in order to assess the fair value of the leased property and determine our incremental borrowing rate given no implicit rate was defined within the lease to allow us to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payments. In addition, as this lease contained land, building and equipment elements, we had to separate the individual elements and analyze each element separately. While our first seven IBX centers were designed and built by us, in light of the availability of fully built-out data centers in select markets at costs significantly below the cost we would incur in building out new space, we have altered our business strategy to acquire fully built-out data centers rather than build out our own data centers in order to meet our IBX expansion needs. Each individual IBX expansion transaction, while still in the form of a long-term lease, is unique. For example, with respect to the Santa Clara IBX acquisition in December 2003, rather than enter into a long-term lease for both the building and data center plant and equipment like the Washington, D.C. metro area IBX transaction mentioned above, we leased only the building in Santa Clara and purchased the data center property and equipment located in the building. Yet, the building lease had payment terms which were at a premium to prevailing market rates for similar properties at the time of signing the lease. As a result, we recorded an unfavorable lease liability, which is being amortized into rent expense over the term 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements of the lease. Also, given that the Santa Clara data center was an operating data center, unlike the vacant Washington, D.C. metro area data center, we were required to negotiate with various customers located in the data center and enter into new contracts with these customers. In addition, we hired a number of the employees that were already working in this data center. As a result, we recorded several intangible assets. In summary, each individual data center expansion will require a significant amount of judgment and management estimates in order to properly address the accounting treatment. Accounting for Restructuring Charges. We have recorded restructuring charges in three of the past five years as we modified our business strategy in light of changing economic circumstances. Most recently, in December 2004, in light of the availability of fully built-out data centers in select markets at costs significantly below those costs we would incur in building out new space, we made the decision to exit leases for excess space adjacent to one of our New York metro area IBXs, as well as space on the floor above our original Los Angeles IBX. As a result of our decision to exit these spaces, we recorded a restructuring charge totaling $17.7 million, which represents the present value of our estimated future cash payments, net of any estimated subrental income and expense, through the remainder of these lease terms, as well as the write-off of all remaining property and equipment attributed to the excess space on the floor above our Los Angeles IBX. We entered into a two-year sublease agreement for the excess space in the New York metro area and are currently evaluating opportunities related to our excess space in Los Angeles. We account for such activities in accordance with SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” Under the provisions of SFAS No. 146, we had to estimate the future cash payments required to exit these two leases, net of any estimated sub-rental income and expense, through the remainder of these lease terms and then determine the present value of such future cash flows to record the appropriate restructuring charge. In future periods, we will record accretion expense to accrete our accrued restructuring liability up to an amount equal to the total estimated future cash payments necessary to complete the exit of these leases. This restructuring activity required a significant amount of judgment and management estimates in order to determine a reasonable scenario of future net cash flows required to exit these leases, as well as to determine the appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of the future net cash flows. Should the actual lease exit costs differ from our estimates, we may be required to adjust our restructuring charges associated with these two leases, which would impact net income in the period such determination was made. In addition, in the future, circumstances may change which would require us to record additional restructuring charges, which would require similar levels of judgment and management estimates in order to determine the appropriate restructuring charge to record. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based compensation plans in accordance with SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” As permitted under SFAS No. 123, we use the intrinsic value-based method of Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” to account for our employee stock-based compensation plans. Under APB Opinion No. 25, compensation expense is based on the difference, if any, on the date of grant, between the fair value of our shares and the exercise price of the option. Unearned deferred compensation resulting from employee option grants is amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the individual options, in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 28, “Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans.” We have also adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure—An Amendment of SFAS No. 123.” Primarily as a result of employee stock options being granted at exercise prices below fair market value prior to the Company’s initial public offering (IPO) in August 2000, the Company recorded a deferred stock-based compensation charge on its balance sheet of $54,537,000 in 2000, which was amortized over the four-year vesting life of these individual stock options net of the reversal of any previously recorded accelerated stock-based compensation expense due to the forfeitures of those stock options prior to vesting. The amortization of the 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements deferred stock-based compensation related to these pre-IPO stock options ended in August 2004. Subsequent to our IPO, since we generally only grant stock options at fair value on the date of grant, we currently do not have any significant deferred stock-based compensation remaining to be amortized. As of December 31, 2004, deferred stock-based compensation on our balance sheet totaled $260,000, and for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $1,467,000, $2,905,000 and $6,878,000. Had the Company recognized stock-based compensation under the fair value provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company would have recognized stock-based compensation expense of $20,756,000, $10,238,000 and $12,866,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with assumptions appropriate to this three-year period. For further detailed information on how we calculated these pro forma stock-based compensation charges, see Note 1 of our “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K below. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No. 123(R) revises SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock-based compensation, such as employee stock purchase plans and restricted stock awards. In addition, SFAS No. 123(R) supercedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and amends SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.” Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), stock-based compensation awards must meet certain criteria in order for the award to qualify for equity classification. An award that does not meet those criteria will be classified as a liability and will need to be re-measured each period. SFAS No. 123(R) retains the requirements on accounting for the income tax effects of stock-based compensation contained in SFAS no. 123; however, it changes how excess tax benefits will be presented in the statement of cash flows. SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005. Senior management is currently considering the financial accounting, income tax and internal control implications of SFAS No. 123(R). The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) is expected to have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were split between the following revenue classifications (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2004 % 2003 % Recurring revenues $ 154,432 94 % $ 109,957 93 % Non-recurring revenues: Installation and professional services 8,350 5 % 6,221 5 % Other 889 1 % 1,764 2 % 9,239 6 % 7,985 7 % Total revenues $ 163,671 100 % $ 117,942 100 % Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were geographically comprised of the following (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2004 % 2003 % U.S. revenues $ 141,598 87 % $ 99,669 85 % Asia-Pacific revenues 22,073 13 % 18,273 15 % Total revenues $ 163,671 100 % $ 117,942 100 % 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements We recognized revenues of $163.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to revenues of $117.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, a 39% increase. We segment our business geographically between the U.S. and Asia-Pacific as further discussed below. Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation, interconnection and managed infrastructure services. We consider these services recurring as once a customer has been installed in one of our IBX centers they are billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues are a significant component of our total revenues comprising 94% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to 93% in the prior year. Historically, greater than half of our customers order new services each quarter and greater than half of our new orders come from our already installed customer base each quarter. Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer’s initial deployment and professional services that we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring as they are billed typically once and only upon completion of the installation or professional services work performed. The non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer. Installation and professional services revenues increased 34% period over period, primarily due to strong existing and new customer growth during the year. As a percent of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent approximately 5% of total revenues in each period. Other non-recurring revenues are comprised primarily of customer settlements, which represent fees paid to us by customers who wish to terminate their contracts with us prior to their expiration. In addition to reviewing recurring versus non-recurring revenues, we look at two other primary metrics when we analyze our revenues: 1) customer count and 2) weighted-average percentage utilization. Our customer count increased to 950 as of December 31, 2004 versus 712 as of December 31, 2003, an increase of 33%. Our weighted-average utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus total cabinet space available. Our weighted-average utilization rate grew to 45% as of December 31, 2004 from 35% as of December 31, 2003. Although we have substantial capacity for growth, our utilization rates vary from market to market among our 15 worldwide IBX centers. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. Therefore, consistent with our lease of Sprint’s Santa Clara property in December 2003 and our expansion into the Washington, D.C. metro area market in April 2004 and further expansion into the Silicon Valley market in December 2004, we continually review available space in our other operating markets. U.S. Revenues. We recognized U.S. revenues of $141.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $99.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. U.S. revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $134.3 million and $93.6 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, a 43% increase. U.S. recurring revenues consist primarily of colocation and interconnection services plus a nominal amount of managed infrastructure services. U.S. recurring revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 included revenue generated from the recently acquired Santa Clara IBX center. Excluding revenue from this acquired U.S. IBX hub, the period over period growth in recurring revenues was primarily the result of an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customer growth acquired during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and weighted-average utilization rate as discussed above. As noted above, historically, greater than half of our new orders come from our already installed customer base each period. We expect our U.S. recurring revenues to continue to grow and remain our most significant source of revenue for the foreseeable future. In addition, U.S. revenues consisted of non-recurring revenues of $7.3 million and $6.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Non-recurring revenues are primarily related to the recognized portion of deferred installation, professional services and settlement fees associated with certain contract terminations. Included in U.S. non-recurring revenues are settlement fees of $609,000 and $1.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. The $609,000 in settlement fees for the year ended 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements December 31, 2004 primarily represented a bankruptcy court-mandated payment from Excite@Home. The $1.2 million in settlement fees for the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily represented bankruptcy court-mandated payments from both Worldcom and Excite@Home. Excluding any settlement fees that we may recognize in the future, we expect our U.S. non-recurring revenues to increase moderately in the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our customer base and recognize deferred non-recurring revenue attributed to certain custom projects for the U.S. government. Asia-Pacific Revenues. We recognized Asia-Pacific revenues of $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Asia-Pacific revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $20.2 million and $16.3 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, consisting primarily of colocation and managed infrastructure services. In addition, Asia-Pacific revenues consisted of non-recurring revenues of $1.9 million for both years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Asia-Pacific non-recurring revenues included $280,000 and $584,000, respectively, of contract settlement revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Asia-Pacific revenues are generated from Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo with Singapore representing approximately 52% and 77%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Our Asia-Pacific colocation revenues are similar to the revenues that we generate from our U.S. IBX centers; however, our Singapore IBX center has additional managed infrastructure service revenue, such as mail service and managed platform solutions, which we do not currently offer in any other IBX center location. The growth in our Asia-Pacific revenues is primarily the result of an increase in the customer base in this region during the past year, particularly in Tokyo and Sydney; however, this revenue growth was partially offset by a decrease in low-margin bandwidth revenue in Singapore of approximately $3.1 million. We expect our Asia-Pacific revenues to grow over the foreseeable future. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues were $136.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $128.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, a 7% increase. The largest cost components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX centers, utility costs including electricity and bandwidth, IBX employees’ salaries and benefits, supplies and equipment and security services. A substantial majority of our cost of revenues are fixed in nature and do not vary significantly from period to period. However, there are certain costs, which are considered variable in nature, including utilities and supplies, that are directly related to growth of services for our existing and new customer base. Given a large component of our cost of revenues are fixed in nature, we anticipate any growth in revenues will have a significant incremental flow-through to gross profit; however, power and cooling requirements are growing on a per server basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. This, combined with the fact that we do not currently control the amount of draw our customers take from installed circuits, means that our utility costs are expected to increase in the future, and we may not be successful in raising power revenues to a sufficient level to offset such expected increases in utility costs. We continue to monitor power draw and rates in each of our IBX centers. U.S. Cost of Revenues. U.S. cost of revenues were $118.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $107.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. U.S. cost of revenues included $50.1 million of depreciation expense, $35,000 of stock-based compensation expense, $355,000 of accretion expense associated with our asset retirement obligations relating to our various leaseholds and $147,000 of amortization expense associated with an intangible asset related to our Santa Clara IBX center for the year ended December 31, 2004. U.S. cost of revenues included $49.9 million of depreciation expense, $59,000 of stock-based compensation expense, $562,000 of accretion expense associated with our asset retirement obligations relating to our various leaseholds and $13,000 of amortization expense associated with an intangible asset related to our Santa Clara IBX center for the year ended December 31, 2003. Excluding depreciation, stock-based compensation, accretion expense and amortization expense, U.S. cost of revenues increased period over period to $67.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $56.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, a 19% increase. This increase is primarily the result of the operating costs associated with the Santa Clara IBX center acquired on December 1, 2003, as well as increasing utility costs in our IBX centers, excluding the newly- 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements acquired Santa Clara IBX, of $4.1 million in line with increasing customer installations and revenues attributed to this customer growth and $1.2 million of higher compensation costs in our IBX centers, excluding the newly-acquired Santa Clara IBX, including general salary increases and bonuses for our IBX staff. We continue to anticipate that our cost of revenues will increase in the foreseeable future as the occupancy levels in our U.S. IBX centers increase, however as a percent of revenues, we anticipate our cost of revenues will continue to decline. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues were $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues included $3.7 million of depreciation expense and $194,000 of non-cash rent expense associated with the value attributed to warrants issued to our landlord in connection with a lease amendment for our Hong Kong IBX center for the year ended December 31, 2004. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues included $4.4 million of depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2003. Excluding depreciation and non-cash rent expense, Asia-Pacific cost of revenues decreased period over period to $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, a 9% decrease. This decrease is primarily the result of (i) a decrease in bandwidth costs in Singapore associated with a corresponding decrease in low-margin bandwidth revenue in this location of approximately $2.4 million, (ii) a decrease in operating costs in Singapore as a result of the asset sale of one of our two IBX centers in Singapore that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2003 of $804,000 and (iii) the renegotiation and reduction of our Hong Kong and Tokyo lease costs, resulting in rent savings of approximately $538,000. These decreases are partially offset by some cost increases in line with increasing customer installations and revenues attributed to our customer growth in this region, including increasing utility costs in our Asia-Pacific IBX centers of $649,000. Our Asia-Pacific costs of revenues are generated in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. There are several managed IT infrastructure service revenue streams unique to our Singapore IBX hub, such as mail service and managed platform solutions, that are more labor intensive than our service offerings in the United States. As a result, our Singapore IBX center has a greater number of employees than any of our other IBX centers, and therefore, a greater labor cost relative to our other IBX centers in the United States or other Asia-Pacific locations. We anticipate that our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues will experience moderate growth in the foreseeable future consistent with our anticipated growth in revenues in this region. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses decreased to $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. U.S. Sales and Marketing Expenses. U.S. sales and marketing expenses increased to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Included in U.S. sales and marketing expenses were $119,000 and $299,000, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense and amortization expense associated with an intangible asset in connection with our Santa Clara IBX center for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Excluding stock-based compensation and amortization expense, U.S. sales and marketing expenses increased to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, a 12% increase. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel. This increase is primarily due to increased compensation costs of $1.1 million, primarily as a result of growth in our revenue bookings and an increase in the number of sales and marketing headcount. Going forward, we expect U.S. sales and marketing spending to increase at a measured rate but will decrease as a percent of revenues. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses decreased to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Included in Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses were $1.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively, of amortization expense associated with several intangible assets associated with our Singapore operations for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Excluding amortization expense, Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses decreased to $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 down from $4.8 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of headcount and overall compensation cost reductions in the Singapore region last 28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements year of approximately 14% and a decrease in overall discretionary spending due in large part to synergistic savings as a result of the combination that closed on December 31, 2002. Our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses consist of the same type of costs that we incur in our U.S. operations, namely compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel. Our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses are generated in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. We expect that our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses excluding amortization of intangible assets will remain relatively flat in the foreseeable future; however, as a result of the intangible assets in Singapore having now been fully amortized during December 2004, total Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses will decrease further commencing in 2005. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased to $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $34.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. U.S. General and Administrative Expenses. U.S. general and administrative expenses decreased to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Included in U.S. general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004, were $1.8 million and $1.4 million of depreciation expense and stock-based compensation expense, respectively. Included in U.S. general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003, were $5.3 million and $2.6 million of depreciation expense and stock-based compensation expense, respectively. Depreciation and stock-based compensation expense decreased period over period as certain headquarter-based assets became fully depreciated during the year, and certain stock-based compensation costs became fully amortized. Excluding depreciation and stock-based compensation expense, U.S. general and administrative expenses increased to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $20.4 million for the prior year, an 11% increase. This increase is primarily due to higher professional service fees and other legal-related costs and expenses of $1.8 million, including $733,000 of external costs attributed to our Sarbanes-Oxley compliance initiatives. We continue to incur additional costs related to our Sarbanes-Oxley compliance initiative and this initiative will continue to impose additional costs on Equinix as a public company, both in the form of outside professional service fees for auditors and other advisors, and internal costs related to various devoted teams throughout the organization. We also have higher overall compensation costs of $1.9 million related to annual salary merit increases and corporate bonus programs, as well as an increase in the number of new hires over the past year. In addition, during 2004, we incurred a net charge of $190,000 related to the liquidation of certain legacy subsidiaries in Europe and we do not expect this cost to recur (we initially recorded a charge of $512,000 in the third quarter, which was offset by a reduction in the charge of $322,000 in the fourth quarter as a result of a favorable settlement reached in December 2004). These increases in costs are partially offset by some savings related to the shutdown of the Pihana corporate office in Honolulu that was completed in June 2003, and the relocation of the corporate headquarter office from Mountain View to Foster City in March 2003 totaling $1.9 million. General and administrative expenses, excluding depreciation and stock-based compensation, consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, accounting, legal and administrative expenses, professional service fees and other general corporate expenses such as our corporate headquarter office lease. Going forward we expect to see U.S. general and administrative spending increase nominally in absolute dollars, but decrease as a percent of revenues. Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses increased to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Included in Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses were $366,000 and $497,000, respectively, of depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Excluding depreciation, Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses increased to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $5.5 million for the prior year, a 13% increase. This increase is primarily related to an increase in professional service fees of $141,000 related to our Sarbanes-Oxley compliance initiative in Singapore and higher compensation costs of $450,000 as a result of annual merit increases and corporate bonus programs. Our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses consist of the same type of costs that we incur in our U.S. operations, namely salaries and related expenses, accounting, legal and administrative expenses, 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements professional service fees and other general corporate expenses. Our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses are generated in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. Our Asia-Pacific headquarter office is located in Singapore. Most of the corporate overhead support functions that we have in the U.S. also reside in our Singapore office in order to support our Asia-Pacific operations. In addition, we have separate office locations in Hong Kong and Tokyo. We expect our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses will remain relatively flat or experience only moderate growth for the foreseeable future. Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded restructuring charges of $17.7 million. In light of the availability of fully built-out data centers in select markets at costs significantly below those costs we would incur in building out new space, we made the decision in December 2004 to exit leases for excess space adjacent to one of our New York metro area IBXs, as well as space on the floor above our original Los Angeles IBX. The restructuring charges consisted of (i) a $13.9 million charge representing the present value of our estimated future cash payments, net of any estimated subrental income and expense, through the remainder of these lease terms; and (ii) a write-off of property and equipment of $3.8 million, representing the write-off of all remaining property and equipment attributed to the excess space on the floor above our Los Angeles IBX. We entered into a two-year sublease agreement for the excess space in the New York metro area and are currently evaluating opportunities related to our excess space in Los Angeles. We expect that as a result of these restructuring charges, we will realize annual savings in cost of revenues commencing in 2005 of approximately $1.8 million. As of December 31, 2004, we had total accrued restructuring charges of $14.8 million recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet related to these excess lease spaces. For further detailed information on our restructuring charges, see Note 17 of our “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K below. We did not incur any restructuring charges during the year ended December 31, 2003. Interest Income. Interest income increased to $1.3 million from $296,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Interest income increased due to higher average cash, cash equivalent and short-term and long-term investment balances held in interest-bearing accounts during these periods, as well as to increased yields on those balances. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $11.5 million from $20.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the reduction in the principal balance outstanding on our credit facility during 2003 and 2004. These interest expense savings were partially offset by additional non-cash interest expense associated with the $10.0 million 10% convertible secured notes issued on June 5, 2003 as a result of the Crosslink financing. However, during the quarter ended March 31, 2004, with the proceeds from the convertible debenture offering, we fully paid off the remaining credit facility and two other debt facilities, as well as fully redeemed the remaining 13% senior notes that were outstanding. In addition, in March 2004, the $10.0 million 10% convertible secured notes issued in connection with the Crosslink financing were converted to 2.5 million shares of our common stock. As a result of these various repayments, redemption and conversion of our older debt facilities, which have been replaced with our $86.3 million 2.5% convertible subordinated debentures, our interest expense commencing with the second quarter of 2004 was significantly reduced. Absent additional financings, we expect that our interest expense will continue to decrease in 2005 as a result of the conversion in January 2005 of the STT convertible secured notes, bearing non-cash interest at 14%. This interest savings, however, will be partially offset by additional interest expense attributed to our $35.3 million capital lease, which bears interest at 8.5%, related to our new data center in the Washington D.C. metro area. Loss on Debt Extinguishment and Conversion. In February 2004, with the proceeds from the convertible debenture offering, we fully paid off the remaining credit facility and two other debt facilities, as well as fully redeemed the remaining 13% senior notes that were outstanding at a premium of 106.5% through March 2004. In addition, in March 2004, the 10% $10.0 million convertible secured notes issued in connection with the Crosslink 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements financing, which contained a beneficial conversion feature, were converted to 2.5 million shares of our common stock. As a result of these various repayments, redemption and conversion of our older debt facilities, we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment and conversion of $16.2 million, comprised primarily of the write-off of the various debt issuance costs and discounts associated with these various debt facilities totaling $13.7 million, as well as the premium paid to the holders of our 13% senior notes required to redeem these early and other cash transaction costs totaling $2.5 million. There was no such debt extinguishment or conversion activity during the year ended December 31, 2003. Income Taxes. A full valuation allowance is recorded against our deferred tax assets as management cannot conclude, based on available objective evidence, when it is more likely than not that the gross value of its deferred tax assets will be realized. However, for the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded $153,000 of income tax expense, primarily representing income taxes related to our international subsidiaries. We have previously not incurred any significant income tax expense since inception and we do not expect to incur any significant income tax expense during 2005 and 2006. Years Ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 Revenues. Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were split between the following revenue classifications (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2003 % 2002 % Recurring revenues $ 109,957 93 % $ 65,319 85 % Non-recurring revenues: Installation and professional services 6,221 5 % 4,056 5 % Other 1,764 2 % 7,813 10 % 7,985 7 % 11,869 15 % Total revenues $ 117,942 100 % $ 77,188 100 % Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were geographically comprised of the following (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2003 % 2002 % U.S. revenues $ 99,669 85 % $ 77,188 100 % Asia-Pacific revenues 18,273 15 % — 0 % Total revenues $ 117,942 100 % $ 77,188 100 % We recognized revenues of $117.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to revenues of $77.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, a 53% increase. Included in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, are the results of the two companies that we acquired on December 31, 2002, i-STT and Pihana, totaling $23.4 million. We segment our business geographically between the U.S. and Asia-Pacific as further discussed below. Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation, interconnection and managed infrastructure services. We consider these services as recurring as once a customer has been installed in one of our IBX centers they are billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues are a significant component of our total revenues comprising 93% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase from the 85% level in the prior year. To review our revenue recognition policies for our recurring revenue streams, refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” above. 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer’s initial deployment and, professional services that we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring as they are billed typically once and only upon completion of the installation or professional services work performed. The non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer. Installation and professional services revenues increased 53% year over year, primarily due to strong existing and new customer growth during the year. As a percent of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent approximately 5% of total revenues in each year. Other non-recurring revenues include equipment resales and customer settlements. This non-recurring revenue line decreased significantly from the prior year as (i) we are no longer pursuing equipment resales due a change in product strategy and (ii) the number of customer right-sizings and settlements decreased substantially during 2003. To review our revenue recognition policies for our non-recurring revenue streams, refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” above. In addition to reviewing recurring versus non-recurring revenues, we look at two other primary metrics when we analyze our revenues: 1) customer count and 2) percentage utilization. Our customer count increased to 712 as of December 31, 2003 versus 568 as of December 31, 2002, an increase of 25%. Our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus total cabinet space available. Our utilization rate as of December 31, 2003 was 37% versus 29% as of December 31, 2002, an increase of 28%, including our Asia-Pacific operations for both periods. Although we have substantial capacity for growth, our utilization rates vary from market to market among our 15 worldwide IBX centers. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. Therefore, consistent with our acquisition of the Sprint’s Santa Clara property in December 2003, we will continue to review our available space in our other operating markets. U.S. Revenues. We recognized U.S. revenues of $99.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $77.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. U.S. revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $93.6 million and $65.3 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, a 43% increase. U.S. recurring revenues consist primarily of colocation and interconnection services plus a nominal amount of managed infrastructure services. U.S. recurring revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes $5.1 million of revenues generated from the two U.S. IBX centers acquired from Pihana on December 31, 2002 located in Los Angeles and Honolulu. Excluding revenues from these acquired U.S. IBX centers, the period over period growth in recurring revenues of 60% was primarily the result of an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customer growth acquired during the year as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate as discussed above. In addition, consistent with the growth in our customer base, our interconnection revenues have grown as our customers continue to expand their interconnection activity with each other. As of December 31, 2003, U.S. interconnection revenue represented 21% of total U.S. recurring revenue as compared to 9% in the prior year. We expect our U.S. recurring revenues to continue to grow and remain our most significant source of revenue for the foreseeable future. In addition, U.S. revenues consisted of non-recurring revenues of $6.1 million and $11.9 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. Non-recurring revenues are primarily related to the recognized portion of deferred installation, professional services, settlement fees associated with certain contract terminations and equipment resales. The period over period decrease in U.S. non-recurring revenues was primarily the result of $2.9 million of equipment resale revenue and $4.9 million in settlement fees from customers to terminate their contract recognized during the year ended December 31, 2002. There were no equipment resale transactions during the year ended December 31, 2003; however, we received $1.2 million of settlement fees during the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily as a result of bankruptcy related payments from both Worldcom and Excite@home. Excluding any settlement fees that we may recognize in the future, we expect our U.S. non-recurring revenues to remain relatively flat or grow moderately in the foreseeable future. Asia-Pacific Revenues. As a result of the combination that closed on December 31, 2002, which resulted in the acquisition of four Asia-Pacific IBX centers, we recognized $18.2 million of revenues in Asia-Pacific during the year ended December 31, 2003. Prior to the combination we generated no revenues from outside of 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements the United States. Asia-Pacific revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $16.3 million, primarily from colocation and managed infrastructure services, and non-recurring revenues of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, which includes settlement fees of $584,000, primarily from one customer that terminated its contract. Asia-Pacific revenues are generated from Singapore, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney with Singapore representing approximately 77% of the regional revenues. Our Asia-Pacific revenues are similar to the revenues that we generate from our U.S. IBX centers; however, our Singapore IBX center has additional managed infrastructure service revenue, such as mail service and managed platform solutions, which we do not currently offer in any other IBX center location. We expect our Asia-Pacific revenues to decrease slightly during the first half of 2004 as we expect some churn on our low-margin bandwidth revenue in Singapore. However, excluding this expected drop in bandwidth revenue, we would otherwise expect our Asia-Pacific revenues to begin to grow over the course of the year. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues were $128.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 versus $104.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, a 23% increase. Included in cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 are the results of the two companies that we acquired on December 31, 2002, i-STT and Pihana, a cumulative total of $24.7 million. The largest cost components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX centers, utility costs including bandwidth, IBX employees’ salaries and benefits, consumable supplies and equipment and security services. A substantial majority of our cost of revenues are fixed in nature and do not vary significantly from period to period. However, there are certain costs, which are considered variable in nature including utilities and consumable supplies that are directly related to growth of services in our existing and new customer base. Given a large component of our cost of revenues are fixed in nature, we anticipate any growth in revenues will have a significant incremental flow through to gross profit in the 70 – 90% range. U.S. Cost of Revenues. U.S. cost of revenues were $107.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $104.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, a 3.2% increase. U.S. cost of revenues included $49.9 million and $47.8 million, respectively, of depreciation expense and $59,000 and $266,000, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we also recorded $562,000 of accretion expense associated with our asset retirement obligation relating to our various leaseholds, which consist primarily of our IBX center operating leases, as required under FASB No. 143 that was adopted in 2003. Furthermore, U.S. cost of revenues included the costs associated with the $2.9 million of equipment resale revenue that we recorded for the year ended December 31, 2002, which was approximately $2.8 million. We recorded no equipment resale revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003. Included in the U.S. cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, were the operating costs associated with (i) the Los Angeles and Honolulu IBX centers acquired from Pihana in the combination on December 31, 2002, which totaled $4.1 million ($3.5 million excluding depreciation) and (ii) the Santa Clara IBX center acquired on December 1, 2003, which totaled $597,000. Excluding depreciation, stock-based compensation, accretion expense, the costs of equipment resales and the costs of operating the acquired U.S. IBX centers, U.S. cash cost of revenues decreased period over period to $52.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $53.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, a 1% decrease. This decrease is primarily the result of reduced costs associated with the San Jose ground lease of $3.6 million as a result of the option that we exercised in September 2002 to return approximately one-half of the land commencing in October 2002 (refer to ‘Restructuring Charges” below); however, this decrease is partially offset by an increase in operating costs associated with certain of our IBX centers as a result of (a) higher property taxes for certain IBX centers and (b) increasing utility costs in line with increasing customer installations and revenues attributed to this customer growth. We continue to anticipate that our cost of revenues will increase in the foreseeable future as the occupancy levels in our U.S. IBX centers increase, however as a percent of revenues, we anticipate our cost of revenues will continue to decline. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. As a result of the combination that closed on December 31, 2002, which resulted in the acquisition of four Asia-Pacific IBX centers, we incurred an additional $20.6 million in cost of 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements revenues from our Asia-Pacific IBX center operations during the year ended December 31, 2003. Included in this number is $4.4 million of depreciation expense. Excluding depreciation expense, our acquired cost of revenues totaled $16.2 million for Asia-Pacific. Our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues consist of the same type of costs that we incur in our U.S. IBX center operations, namely rental payments for our leased IBX centers, utility costs, site employees’ salaries and benefits, consumable supplies and equipment and security services. Our Asia-Pacific costs of revenues are generated in Singapore, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney. There are several managed IT infrastructure service revenue streams unique to our Singapore IBX hub, such as mail service and managed platform solutions, that are more labor intensive than our service offerings in the United States. As a result, our Singapore IBX center has a greater number of employees than any of our other IBX centers, and therefore, a greater labor cost relative to our other IBX centers in the United States or other Asia-Pacific locations. We anticipate that our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues will experience a small decrease during the first half of 2004 as a result of the expected drop in low-margin bandwidth revenue as discussed above. However, excluding this, we would otherwise expect to see moderate growth in Asia-Pacific cost of revenues in the foreseeable future consistent with our anticipated growth in revenues over the course of the year. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Included in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003, are the results of the two companies that we acquired on December 31, 2002, i-STT and Pihana, totaling $6.9 million. U.S. Sales and Marketing Expenses. U.S. sales and marketing expenses decreased to $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Included in U.S. sales and marketing expenses were $294,000 and $952,000, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded $2.3 million in bad debt expense. The amount of bad debt expense that we recorded in the prior period, which was significantly larger than what we typically incur, was primarily the result of write-offs or full reserves of aged receivables associated with several customers, including Teleglobe, which had filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code last year. Excluding stock-based compensation and bad debt expense, U.S. sales and marketing expenses increased to $12.4 million from $12.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, a 3% increase. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel. Excluding stock-based compensation and bad debt expense, the nominal increase in sales and marketing expenses year over year is primarily related to the incremental sales and marketing efforts associated with the two U.S. IBX centers acquired in the combination as of December 31, 2002 in Los Angeles and Honolulu, as well as an overall increase in sales compensation due to increased revenues. We expect to see a nominal increase in sales and marketing spending in the future, although as a percent of revenues, we anticipate a decline in sales and marketing spending. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. As a result of the combination that closed on December 31, 2002, we incurred an additional $6.9 million of sales and marketing expenses, comprised of $4.8 million in cash sales and marketing expenses from our Asia-Pacific operations during the year ended December 31, 2003, and $2.1 million of amortization expense. Our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses consist of the same type of costs that we incur in our U.S. operations, namely compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel. Our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses are generated in Singapore, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney. We expect that our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses will remain relatively flat in the foreseeable future. As a result of the combination that closed on December 31, 2002, we acquired several intangible assets that we amortize, namely the use of a trade-name and certain customer contracts in Singapore valued at approximately $300,000 and $3.6 million, respectively. The trade-name intangible asset was being amortized over one year ending December 31, 2003 and the customer contract intangible asset is being amortized over two years, ending December 31, 2004. As a result, we incurred a total of $2.1 million of amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2003. 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased to $34.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Included in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003, are the results of the two companies that we acquired on December 31, 2002, i-STT and Pihana, totaling $7.5 million. U.S. General and Administrative Expenses. U.S. general and administrative expenses decreased to $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Included in U.S. general and administrative expenses were $5.3 million and $6.2 million, respectively, of depreciation expense and $2.6 million and $5.7 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. In addition, U.S. general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003, included $1.5 million of costs associated with a corporate headquarter office acquired from Pihana on December 31, 2002 located in Honolulu. This office was closed as of June 30, 2003. Excluding depreciation, stock-based compensation expense and the costs of the acquired Honolulu office, U.S. general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat at $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. General and administrative expenses, excluding depreciation and stock-based compensation, consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, accounting, legal and administrative expenses, professional service fees and other general corporate expenses such as our corporate headquarter office lease. We expect to see a nominal increase in general and administrative spending in the future, although as a percent of revenues, we anticipate a decline in general and administrative spending. Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. As a result of the combination that closed on December 31, 2002, we incurred an additional $6.0 million in general and administrative expenses from our newly-acquired Asia-Pacific operations. Our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses, which included $497,000 of depreciation expense, consist of the same type of costs that we incur in our U.S. operations, namely salaries and related expenses, accounting, legal and administrative expenses, professional service fees and other general corporate expenses. Our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses are generated in Singapore, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney. Our Asia-Pacific headquarter office is located in Singapore. Most of the corporate overhead support functions that we have in the U.S. also reside in our Singapore office in order to support our Asia-Pacific operations. In addition, we have separate corporate office locations in Tokyo and Hong Kong. We expect that our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses will remain relatively flat or experience only moderate growth for the foreseeable future. Restructuring Charges. We did not incur any restructuring charges during the year ended December 31, 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded restructuring charges of $28.9 million. The restructuring charges consisted of (a) a $5.0 million option fee paid in May 2002 related to the amendment of our approximately 80 acre ground lease in San Jose, California from which we subsequently elected to exercise the option to permanently exclude 40 acres commencing October 1, 2002; (b) a partial write-off of two letters of credit totaling $19.0 million associated with the exercise in September 2002 of our option to permanently terminate approximately one-half of our lease obligations under the San Jose ground lease (c) a write-off of property and equipment of $2.6 million, primarily leasehold improvements and some equipment, located in two unnecessary U.S. IBX expansion and headquarter office space operating leaseholds we had decided to exit and that do not currently provide any ongoing benefit and (d) write-offs or accruals of certain U.S. or European exit costs and severance charges. Interest Income. Interest income decreased to $296,000 from $998,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Interest income decreased due to lower average cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balances held in interest-bearing accounts and lower interest rates received on those invested balances. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $20.5 million from $35.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The significant decrease in interest expense was primarily 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements attributable to the retirement of $169.5 million of our 13% senior notes during 2002. In addition, we reduced the interest expense attributed to our credit facility as a result of a reduction in the principal balance outstanding and a reduction in the interest rates. However, these interest expense savings were partially offset by the approximately $7.3 million of non-cash interest expense associated with the $30.0 million 14% convertible secured note issued on December 31, 2002 as a result of the financing, and the $10.0 million 10% convertible secured notes issued on June 5, 2003 as a result of the Crosslink financing. We recorded a substantial debt discount equal to the $10.0 million of principal in connection with the Crosslink financing, primarily as a result of the beneficial conversion feature associated with these convertible secured notes, which is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Crosslink financing. This is a primary contributor to our increased non-cash interest expense from the prior period. Gain on Debt Extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we retired approximately $169.5 million of senior notes in exchange for approximately 2.4 million shares of common stock and $17.7 million of cash. As a result, we recognized a $114.2 million net gain on debt extinguishment during 2002, after deducting transaction costs, interest waived and allocation of unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discount. Although we made payments on our various debt facilities during 2003, we extinguished no senior notes or other debt during the year ended December 31, 2003. Income Taxes. A full valuation allowance is recorded against our deferred tax assets as management cannot conclude, based on available objective evidence, when it is more likely than not that the gross value of its deferred tax assets will be realized. Liquidity and Capital Resources Since inception, we have financed our operations and capital requirements primarily through the issuance of various debt and equity instruments, for aggregate gross proceeds of $1.1 billion. As of December 31, 2004, our total indebtedness was comprised of non-convertible debt totaling $35.2 million from our Washington D.C. metro area IBX capital lease and convertible debt totaling $124.7 million from our convertible secured notes and convertible subordinated debentures as outlined below. During February 2004, we sold $86.3 million in aggregate principal of 2.5% convertible subordinated debentures due 2024 to qualified institutional buyers. We used the net proceeds from this offering primarily to repay all amounts outstanding under our previously outstanding non-convertible debt as outlined below. We refer to this transaction as the “convertible debenture offering.” During March 2004, holders of our 10% $10.0 million convertible secured notes issued in connection with the Crosslink financing, converted the $10.0 million of principal into 2.5 million shares of our common stock. We refer to this transaction as the “Crosslink conversion.” We recorded a significant loss on debt extinguishment and conversion totaling $16.2 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2004, primarily related to the non-cash write-off of debt issuance costs and discounts in connection with the various debt repayments, redemptions and conversions of the underlying debt facilities extinguished or converted, as well as the cash premium that we paid on our 13% senior notes. As of December 31, 2004, our principal source of liquidity was our $108.1 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. We believe that this cash, coupled with our anticipated cash flows generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure, debt service and corporate overhead requirements to meet our currently identified business objectives. In addition, in December 2004, as a result of the Silicon Valley Bank credit line, as further described below, we have $21.8 million of additional liquidity available to us in the event we need additional cash to pursue attractive strategic opportunities that may become available in the future. While we had generated negative operating cashflow in each annual period since inception through 2003, commencing the quarter ended September 30, 2003 we started to generate positive operating cash flow. During that quarter, our revenues grew to a level sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements related to our predominantly fixed cost structure related to our existing IBX centers. We considered that quarter to be the 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements inflection point in our business model whereby our revenues were sufficient on an ongoing basis to meet all our operating costs and working capital requirements. As a result of reaching this point in our operating history, we have generated cash from our operations during 2004 and expect this generation of operating cash flows to continue in 2005 and beyond and to be in an amount sufficient to meet our cash requirements to fund our capital expenditures, debt service and corporate overhead requirements (excluding the purchase, sale and maturities of our short-term and long-term investments). However, given our limited operating history, we may not achieve our desired levels of profitability in the future. See “Other Factors Affecting Operating Results.” Uses of Cash Net cash provided by our operating activities was $36.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Net cash used in our operating activities was $17.3 million and $27.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As described above, we have now reached and are moving beyond the inflection point in our business model whereby our revenues are sufficient to cover our operating expenses and we are now generating cash from our operations. In prior periods, we used cash primarily to fund our net loss, including cash interest payments on our senior notes and credit facility, although the majority of the operating cash flows used during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 related to the liquidation of accrued obligations, such as accrued restructuring activities, including merger and financing costs during 2003. In addition, we continue to experience strong collections of our accounts receivables. As described above, we expect that we will continue to generate cash from our operating activities throughout 2005 and beyond. Net cash used in investing activities was $56.9 million, $49.2 million and $7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily for the net purchase of short-term and long-term investments, as well as to fund capital expenditures to bring our recently acquired IBX centers in the Silicon Valley and Washington DC metro areas to Equinix standards and to support our growing customer base. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2003 was primarily the result of the purchase of short-term investments and some nominal amount of capital expenditures, partially offset by the release of restricted cash to fund a cash interest payment on our senior notes in January 2003. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2002 was primarily attributable to the liquidation of accrued construction costs for the New York metropolitan area IBX hub, which opened during the first quarter of 2002, partially offset by the sale of short-term investments. For 2005, we anticipate that our cash used in investing activities, excluding the purchases, sales and maturities of short-term and long-term investments, will primarily fund our capital expenditures. Net cash generated by financing activities was $19.2 million, $52.3 million and $16.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net cash generated by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004, was primarily the result of the $86.3 million in gross proceeds from our convertible debenture offering, offset by $70.8 million in payments on our credit facility, senior notes and other debt facilities and capital lease obligations, as well as debt extinguishment costs associated with paying down these facilities and $7.3 million in proceeds from our various employee stock plans. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2003 was primarily the result of the $104.4 million in net proceeds of our follow-on equity offering and $10.0 million in proceeds from the Crosslink financing, partially offset by $57.2 million in payments on our credit facility and $6.1 million in payments on our various other debt facilities and capital lease obligations. Net cash generated by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2002 was primarily attributable to the cash acquired in the acquisitions of i-STT and Pihana and proceeds from our $30.0 million convertible secured notes, offset by payments of $17.7 million used to retire approximately $169.5 million of our senior notes and the costs associated with the exchange of the senior notes and repayments under our credit facility of $13.5 million. Debt Obligations—Non-Convertible Debt As of December 31, 2004, our only indebtedness from non-convertible debt related to a capital lease associated with our new IBX center in the Washington D.C. metro area totaling $35.2 million. In addition, in 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements December 2004, as a result of the Silicon Valley Bank credit line, as further described below, we have $21.8 million of additional liquidity available to us in the event we need additional cash to pursue attractive strategic opportunities that may become available in the future. Prior to this, our non-convertible debt was comprised of our senior notes, credit facility, and other debt facilities and capital lease obligations as follows: Senior Notes. In December 1999, we issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 13% senior notes due 2007. During 2002, we retired $169.5 million of the senior notes in exchange for approximately 2.4 million shares of common stock and approximately $21.3 million of cash. As of December 31, 2003, a total of $30.5 million of senior note principal remained outstanding, which was presented, net of unamortized discount, on our balance sheet at $29.2 million. In March 2004, with the net proceeds from our convertible debenture offering, we exercised our right to redeem all of our senior notes. The redemption price for the senior notes was equal to 106.5% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to the redemption date. As a result, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment on this transaction of $3.8 million, comprised of the 6.5% premium that we paid to redeem the senior notes, the write-off of debt issuance costs and debt discount and other transaction fees. Credit Facility. In December 2000, we entered into the credit facility with a syndicate of lenders under which, subject to our compliance with a number of financial ratios and covenants, we were permitted to borrow up to $150.0 million, which was fully drawn down during 2001. This facility was amended at various times during 2001, 2002 and 2003. As of December 31, 2003, a total of $34.3 million of principal remained outstanding under the credit facility. In February 2004, with the net proceeds from our convertible debenture offering, we repaid all amounts outstanding under our credit facility and terminated the credit facility. As a result, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment on this transaction of $4.4 million, comprised primarily of the write-off of debt issuance costs as well as some other transaction fees. Other Debt Facilities and Capital Lease Obligations. In August 1999, we entered into a loan agreement with Venture Lending and Leasing in the amount of $10.0 million and fully drew down on this amount. This loan agreement bore interest at 8.5% and was repayable over 42 months in equal monthly payments with a final interest payment equal to 15% of the advance amounts due on maturity. As of December 31, 2003, principal of $847,000 remained outstanding. In March 2004, with the net proceeds from our convertible debenture offering, we paid off this other debt facility in full. As a result, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment on this transaction of $0.2 million, comprised of the write-off of debt issuance costs and discount as well as some other transaction fees. In June 2001, we entered into a loan agreement with Heller Financial Leasing in the amount of $5.0 million and fully drew down on this amount. This loan agreement bore interest at 13.0% and was repayable over 36 months. As of December 31, 2003, principal of $2.5 million remained outstanding. In February 2004, with the net proceeds from our convertible debenture offering, we paid off this other debt facility in full. As a result, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment on this transaction of $0.2 million, comprised of the write-off of debt issuance costs and discount as well as some other transaction fees. In December 2002, in conjunction with our merger with Pihana, we acquired multiple capital leases with Orix. The original amount financed was approximately $3.5 million. These capital lease arrangements bore interest at an average rate of 6.4% per annum and were repayable over 30 months. As of December 31, 2003, principal of $201,000 remained outstanding. These capital leases were fully paid down by March 31, 2004. Washington D.C. Metro Area IBX Capital Lease. In April 2004, we entered into a long-term lease for a 95,000 square foot data center in the Washington, D.C. metro area. The center is adjacent to the Company’s existing Washington D.C. metro area IBX. This lease, which includes the leasing of all of the IBX plant and machinery equipment located in the building, is a capital lease. We took possession of this property during the fourth quarter of 2004, and as a result, recorded property and equipment assets, as well as a capital lease obligation, totaling $35.3 million. Payments under this lease, which commenced in November 2004, will be 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements made monthly through 2019 at an effective interest rate of 8.50% per annum. As of December 31, 2004, principal of $35.2 remained outstanding. Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line. In December 2004, we entered into a $25.0 million line of credit arrangement with Silicon Valley Bank that matures in December 2006. This facility is a $25.0 million revolving line of credit which, at our election, up to $10.0 million may be converted into a 24-month term loan, repayable in eight quarterly installments. We refer to this transaction as the “Silicon Valley Bank credit line.” Borrowings under the Silicon Valley Bank credit line bear interest at floating interest rates, plus applicable margins, based either on the prime rate or LIBOR. As of December 31, 2004, the Silicon Valley Bank credit line had an interest rate of 4.40% per annum; however, through the date of filing of this report on Form 10-K, we have not drawn down any amounts from this line of credit. The Silicon Valley Bank credit line also features sublimits, which allows us to issue letters of credit, enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and make advances for cash management services. Our utilization under any of these sublimits would have the effect of reducing the amount available for borrowing under the Silicon Valley Bank credit line during the period that such sublimits remain utilized and outstanding. As of December 31, 2004, we had utilized $3.2 million under the letters of credit sublimit with the issuance of three letters of credit and, as a result, reduced the amount of borrowings available to us from $25.0 million to $21.8 million. The Silicon Valley Bank credit line is secured by substantially all of our domestic assets and contains numerous covenants, including financial covenants, such as maintaining minimum cash balance levels and meeting minimum quarterly revenue targets, which we are in full compliance of. The Silicon Valley Bank credit line provides us with additional liquidity and financing flexibility in the future. Debt Obligations—Convertible Debt Convertible Secured Notes. In December 2002, in conjunction with the combination, STT Communications made a $30.0 million strategic investment in the company in the form of a 14% convertible secured note due November 2007. The interest on the convertible secured note is payable in kind in the form of additional convertible secured notes, which we refer to as “PIK notes.” During 2003 and through December 31, 2004, we have issued $8.5 million in PIK notes. The convertible secured note and PIK notes issued to STT Communications are convertible into our preferred and common stock at a price of $9.18 per underlying share, and are convertible anytime at the option of STT Communications. Upon certain conditions, including if the closing price of our common stock exceeds $32.12 per share for thirty consecutive trading days, we had the option of converting the convertible secured notes beginning in 2005. In January 2005, we exercised this right and converted 95% of the outstanding convertible secured notes and accrued and unpaid interest, held by STT Communications, into 4.1 million shares of our preferred stock, which was subsequently converted into 4.1 million shares of our common stock in February 2005. The remaining 5% of the convertible secured notes, totaling $1.9 million, that remain outstanding will be eligible for conversion by Equinix in early 2006 into approximately 250,000 shares (including anticipated interest expense to be incurred during 2005 and early 2006), provided that the closing price of our common stock exceeds $32.12 per share for thirty consecutive trading days. We refer to this transaction as the “STT convertible secured notes conversion.” In June 2003, entities affiliated with Crosslink Capital made a $10.0 million strategic investment in the company in the form of 10% convertible secured notes due November 2007, which contained a beneficial conversion feature. The interest on the convertible secured notes was payable in kind in the form of additional convertible secured notes commencing on the second anniversary of the closing of this transaction. In March 2004, the holders of these notes converted them into 2.5 million shares of our common stock. As a result, we recognized a loss on debt conversion on this transaction of $7.6 million, comprised primarily of the write-off of debt discount due to the beneficial conversion feature. As of December 31, 2004, a total of $38.5 million of convertible secured notes were outstanding, which is presented, net of unamortized discount, on our balance sheet at $35.8 million. In addition, as of December 31, 2004, we had debt issuance costs related to our convertible secured notes of $336,000 remaining to be amortized. All interest expense associated with our convertible secured notes, including the amortization of the unamortized discount of $2.7 million and our unamortized debt issuance costs, represent non-cash interest expense in our 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements statements of operation and cash flow as no cash is expended for this interest. In January 2005, as a result of the STT convertible secured note conversion, 95% of the outstanding convertible secured notes, plus accrued interest and unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, was converted into stockholders’ equity. Convertible Subordinated Debentures. During February 2004, we sold $86.3 million in aggregate principal of 2.5% convertible subordinated debentures due 2024 to qualified institutional buyers. We used the net proceeds from this offering primarily to repay all amounts outstanding under our credit facility and two of our other debt facilities, as well as fully redeemed our remaining 13% senior notes. The interest on the convertible subordinated debentures is payable semi-annually every February and August, which commenced August 2004. Unlike our convertible secured notes, the interest on our convertible subordinated debentures is payable in cash. Our convertible subordinated debentures are convertible into 2.2 million shares of our common stock. Holders of the convertible subordinated debentures may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on February 15, 2009, February 15, 2014 and February 15, 2019, in each case at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, holders of the convertible subordinated debentures may convert their debentures into shares of our common stock upon certain defined circumstances, including during any calendar quarter if the closing price of our common stock is greater than or equal to 120% of $39.50 per share of our common stock, or approximately $47.40 per share, for twenty consecutive trading days during the period of thirty consecutive trading days ending on the last day of the previous calendar quarter. We may redeem all or a portion of the debentures at any time after February 15, 2009 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Debt Maturities, Lease and Other Contractual Commitments We lease our IBX centers and certain equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements expiring through 2020. The following represents our debt maturities, lease and other commitments as of December 31, 2004 (in thousands): Convertiblesecurednotes (1) Convertiblesubordinateddebentures Capital Lease OperatingLeasesCoveredUnderAccruedRestructuringCharges Operating Leases (2) Other ContractualCommitments(2) Total 2005 $ — $ — $ 3,642 $ 2,433 $ 28,638 $ 1,674 $ 36,387 2006 — — 3,733 2,766 30,689 — 37,188 2007 38,466 — 3,826 3,216 30,410 — 75,918 2008 — — 3,922 3,262 29,856 — 37,040 2009 — 86,250 4,020 3,309 29,715 — 123,294 2010 and thereafter — — 45,287 19,964 177,945 — 243,196 38,466 86,250 64,430 34,950 327,253 1,674 553,023 Less amount representing interest — — (29,226 ) — — — (29,226 ) Less amount representing estimated subrental income and expense — — — (15,978 ) — — (15,978 ) Less amount representing accretion — — — (4,222 ) — — (4,222 ) $ 38,466 $ 86,250 $ 35,204 $ 14,750 $ 327,253 $ 1,674 $ 503,597 (1) In January 2005, 95% of our outstanding convertible secured notes were converted into stockholders’ equity. (2) Represents off-balance sheet arrangements. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In December 2004, we entered into a long-term lease for a 103,000 square foot data center in the Silicon Valley area. This data center is close to our existing IBX centers in the Silicon Valley, and expands the global Equinix footprint to approximately 1.4 million square feet. This new lease will add an additional $34.2 million in cumulative monthly lease payments through 2020, commencing February 2005. We will take possession of this property during the first quarter of 2005. We currently intend to place customers in this data center in 2005. Concurrent with the signing of this lease, we also agreed to purchase the assets located in this data center and entered into an agreement to interconnect all three of our Silicon Valley IBX centers to each other through redundant dark fiber links. This will allow our customers to have access to all the networks and customers in each of the three Silicon Valley IBXs. While we have not yet concluded that this lease is an operating lease, for purposes of reflecting our full contractual commitments in the table presented above, this lease is presented within the future operating lease costs presented above. As of December 31, 2004, as a result of the Silicon Valley IBX acquisition described above and the associated agreements, we are obligated to pay $924,000 for the assets located in the data center, which we expect to pay in March 2005 when the Company takes possession of this property. In addition, as of December 31, 2004, we are also obligated to pay $750,000 upon completion of the installation of the redundant dark fiber links currently being installed, which needs to be paid no later than May 1, 2005. These obligations are reflected in the table above under other contractual commitments. In connection with three of our IBX operating leases, we have entered into three irrevocable letters of credit with Silicon Valley Bank. These letters of credit were provided in lieu of cash deposits under the letters of credit sublimit provision in connection with the Silicon Valley Bank credit line. The letters of credit total $3.2 million, are collateralized by the Silicon Valley Bank credit line and automatically renew in successive one-year periods until the final lease expiration dates. If the landlords for any of these three IBX operating leases decide to draw down on these letters of credit, we will be required to fund these letters of credit. This contingent commitment is not reflected in the table above. In December 2004, in light of the availability of fully built-out data centers in select markets at costs significantly below those costs we would incur in building out new space, we made the decision to exit leases for excess space adjacent to one of our New York metro area IBXs, as well as space on the floor above our original Los Angeles IBX. As a result of our decision to exit these spaces, we recorded a restructuring charge totaling $17.7 million, which represents the present value of our estimated future cash payments, net of any estimated subrental income and expense, through the remainder of these lease terms, as well as the write-off of all remaining property and equipment attributed to the partial build-out of the excess space on the floor above our Los Angeles IBX. We have already sublet the excess space in the New York metro area and are currently evaluating opportunities to either sublet the excess space in Los Angeles or terminate this lease altogether. As of December 31, 2004, we had a total restructuring charge accrual of $14.8 million associated with these two leases for excess space on our balance sheet. These obligations are reflected in the table above under operating leases covered under accrued restructuring charges. As a result of our recent IBX expansions in the Silicon Valley and Washington D.C. metro areas, we anticipate that we will incur capital expenditures in excess of what we would otherwise spend had we not acquired these new IBXs. Although we are not contractually obligated to do so, we expect to incur additional capital expenditures in these two markets during 2005 of approximately $10.0 to $12.0 million in order to bring these new IBXs up to Equinix standards. This non-contractual capital expenditure spending is not reflected in the table above. Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and service streams, such as our recent acquisition of the Sprint property in Santa Clara and our recently announced expansions in the Washington, D.C. and Silicon Valley metro area markets. However, we will continue to be very selective with any similar opportunity. As was the case with these recent expansions in the Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. area markets, the criteria will be quality of the design, 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements access to networks, capacity availability in current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to breakeven and in-place customers. Like these recent expansions, the right combination of these factors may be quite attractive for us. Dependent on the particular deal, these acquisitions may require upfront cash payments and additional capital expenditures in order to bring these centers up to Equinix standards. 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business and us: Risks Related to Our Business We have incurred substantial losses in the past and may continue to incur additional losses in the future. Although Equinix has generated cash from operations since the quarter ended September 30, 2003, for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the company incurred net losses of $68.6 million and $84.2 million, respectively. In light of new rules regarding the expensing of stock-based compensation, we do not expect to become net income positive for at least one to two more years. In addition, if we acquire or build-out additional IBX centers, we will have additional depreciation and amortization expenses that will negatively impact our ability to achieve and sustain positive net income. There can be no guarantee that we will become profitable and the company may continue to incur additional losses. Even if we achieve profitability, given the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we operate, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. We expect our operating results to fluctuate. We have experienced fluctuations in our results of operations on a quarterly and annual basis. The fluctuation in our operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We expect to experience significant fluctuations in our operating results in the foreseeable future due to a variety of factors, including: • acquisition of additional IBX centers; • demand for space and services at our IBX centers; • changes in general economic conditions and specific market conditions in the telecommunications and Internet industries; • the provision of customer discounts and credits; • the mix of current and proposed products and services and the gross margins associated with our products and services; • competition in the markets; • conditions related to international operations; • the timing and magnitude of operating expenses, including taxes, capital expenditures and expenses related to the expansion of sales, marketing, operations and acquisitions, if any, of complementary businesses and assets; and • the cost and availability of adequate public utilities, including power. Any of the foregoing factors, or other factors discussed elsewhere in this report, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Although the company has experienced growth in revenues in recent quarters, this growth rate is not necessarily indicative of future operating results. It is possible that the company may never generate net income on a quarterly or annual basis. In addition, a relatively large portion of our expenses are fixed in the short-term, particularly with respect to lease and personnel expenses, depreciation and amortization, and interest expenses. Therefore, our results of operations are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenues. As such, comparisons to prior reporting periods should not be relied upon as indications of the company’s future performance. In addition, our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, we could experience an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our stock. 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements If the market price of our stock continues to be highly volatile, the value of an investment in our common stock may decline. Within the last 12 months, our common stock has traded between $26.50 and $46.39 per share. The market price of the shares of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile. In January 2005, 95% of STT Communications’ outstanding convertible secured notes and associated interest were converted into shares of our non-voting Series A-1 preferred stock. In February 2005, STT Communications elected to convert all of the shares of Series A-1 preferred stock into 4.1 million shares of our common stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock within a narrow period of time could cause our stock price to fall. Announcements may also have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock. These announcements may include: • our operating results; • new issuances of equity, debt or convertible debt; • developments in our relationships with corporate customers; • changes in regulatory policy or interpretation; • changes in the ratings of our stock by securities analysts; • market conditions for telecommunications stocks in general; and • general economic and market conditions. The stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have particularly affected the market prices for emerging telecommunications companies, and which have often been unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price of our common stock. Our inability to use our tax net operating losses will cause us to pay taxes at an earlier date and in greater amounts which may harm our operating results. We believe that our ability to use our pre-2003 tax net operating losses, or NOLs, in any taxable year is subject to limitation under Section 382 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the “Code”) as a result of the significant change in the ownership of our stock that resulted from the combination. We expect that a significant portion of our NOLs accrued prior to December 31, 2002 will expire unused as a result of this limitation. In addition to the limitations on NOL carryforward utilization described above, we believe that Section 382 of the Code will also significantly limit our ability to use the depreciation and amortization on our assets, as well as certain losses on the sale of our assets, to the extent that such depreciation, amortization and losses reflect unrealized depreciation that was inherent in such assets as of the date of the combination. These limitations will cause us to pay taxes at an earlier date and in greater amounts than would occur absent such limitations. While we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place, we are still exposed to potential risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate controls under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In the course of our ongoing evaluation of our internal controls over financing reporting, we have identified areas requiring improvement and are in the process of designing enhanced processes and controls to address the issues identified during our evaluation. We cannot be certain that our efforts will be effective or sufficient for us, or our auditors, to issue unqualified reports in the future. It may be difficult to design and implement effective financial controls for combined operations and differences in existing controls of any acquired businesses may result in weaknesses that require remediation when the financial controls and reporting are combined. 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our ability to manage our operations and growth will require us to improve our operational, financial and management controls, as well as our internal reporting systems and controls. We may not be able to implement improvements to our internal reporting systems and controls in an efficient and timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. If we cannot effectively manage international operations, our revenues may not increase and our business and results of operations would be harmed. In 2002, our sales outside North America represented less than 1% of our revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the combined company recognized 15% of its revenues outside North America. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the combined company recognized 13% of its revenues outside North America. We anticipate that, for the foreseeable future, approximately 15% of the combined company’s revenues will be derived from sources outside North America. To date, the neutrality of the Equinix IBX centers and the variety of networks available to our customers has often been a competitive advantage for us. In certain of our acquired IBX centers, in Singapore in particular, the limited number of carriers available diminishes that advantage. As a result, we may need to adapt our key revenue-generating services and pricing to be competitive in that market. We may experience gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. To date, the majority of Equinix’s revenues and costs have been denominated in U.S. dollars; however, the majority of revenues and costs in our international operations are denominated in Singapore dollars, Japanese yen and Australia and Hong Kong dollars. Although the combined company may undertake foreign exchange hedging transactions to reduce foreign currency transaction exposure, it does not currently intend to eliminate all foreign currency transaction exposure. Where our prices are denominated in U.S. dollars, our sales could be adversely affected by declines in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, thereby making our products more expensive in local currencies. Our international operations are generally subject to a number of additional risks, including: • costs of customizing IBX centers for foreign countries; • protectionist laws and business practices favoring local competition; • greater difficulty or delay in accounts receivable collection; • difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; • political and economic instability; • ability to obtain, transfer, or maintain licenses required by governmental entities with respect to the combined business; and • compliance with governmental regulation with which we have little experience. We may make acquisitions, which pose integration and other risks that could harm our business. We have acquired several new IBX centers recently, and we may seek to acquire additional IBX centers, complementary businesses, products, services and technologies. As a result of these acquisitions, we may be required to incur additional debt and expenditures and issue additional shares of our stock to pay for the acquired business, product, service or technology, which will dilute our existing stockholders’ ownership interest and may delay, or prevent, our profitability. These acquisitions may also expose us to risks such as: • the possibility that we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses or achieve the level of quality in such businesses to which our customers are accustomed; • the possibility that additional capital expenditures may be required; • the possibility that senior management may be required to spend considerable time negotiating agreements and integrating acquired businesses; 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements • the possible loss or reduction in value of acquired businesses; • the possibility that our customers may not accept either the existing equipment infrastructure or the “look-and-feel” of a new or different IBX center; • the possibility that carriers may find it cost-prohibitive or impractical to bring fiber and networks into a new IBX center; and • the possibility of preexisting undisclosed liabilities regarding the property or IBX center, including but not limited to environmental or asbestos liability, of which our insurance may be insufficient or for which we may be unable to secure insurance coverage; We cannot assure you that we would successfully overcome these risks or any other problems encountered with these acquisitions. STT Communications holds a substantial portion of our stock and has significant influence over matters requiring stockholder consent. As of December 31, 2004, STT Communications owned approximately 23% of our outstanding voting stock. In addition, STT Communications is not prohibited from buying shares of our stock in public or private transactions. Because of the diffuse ownership of our stock, STT Communications has significant influence over matters requiring our stockholder approval. In January 2005, 95% of STT Communications’ outstanding convertible secured notes and associated interest were converted into shares of our non-voting Series A-1 preferred stock. In February 2005, STT Communications elected to convert all of the shares of Series A-1 preferred stock into 4.1 million shares of our common stock, which caused STT Communications to own approximately 36% of our outstanding voting stock. As a result, STT Communications is able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, which could prevent or delay a third party from acquiring or merging with us. STT also has a right of first offer, which entitles them to participate in an offering of our equity securities, or securities convertible into our equity securities, to maintain their ownership percentage prior to such offering. Our business could be harmed by prolonged electrical power outages or shortages, increased costs of energy or general availability of electrical resources. Our IBX centers are susceptible to regional costs of power, electrical power shortages, planned or unplanned power outages caused by these shortages such as those that occurred in California during 2001 and in the Northeast in 2003 or natural disasters such as the hurricanes in the Southeast in 2004, and limitations, especially internationally, of adequate power resources. The overall power shortage in California has increased the cost of energy, which we may not be able to pass on to our customers. We attempt to limit exposure to system downtime by using backup generators and power supplies. Power outages, which last beyond our backup and alternative power arrangements, could harm our customers and our business. In addition, power and cooling requirements are growing on a per server basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. This, combined with the fact that we generally do not control the amount of draw our customers take from installed circuits, means that we could face power limitations in our centers. This could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given center, which could have a negative impact on our financial performance, operating results and cash flows. Increases in property taxes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our IBX centers are subject to state and local real property taxes. The state and local real property taxes on our IBX centers may increase as property tax rates change and as the value of the properties are assessed or 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements reassessed by taxing authorities. Many state and local governments are facing budget deficits, which may cause them to increase assessments or taxes. If property taxes increase, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. We may be forced to take steps, and may be prevented from pursuing certain business opportunities, to ensure compliance with certain tax-related covenants agreed to by us in the combination agreement. We agreed to a covenant in the combination agreement (which we refer to as the FIRPTA covenant) that we would use all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that at all times from and after the closing of the combination until such time as neither STT Communications nor its affiliates hold our capital stock or debt securities (or the capital stock received upon conversion of the debt securities) received by STT Communications in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated in the combination agreement, none of our capital stock issued to STT Communications would constitute “United States real property interests” within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the Code. Under Section 897(c) of the Code, our capital stock issued to STT Communications would generally constitute “United States real property interests” at such point in time that the fair market value of the “United States real property interests” owned by us equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the aggregate fair market values of (a) our “United States real property interests,” (b) our interests in real property located outside the U.S., and (c) any other assets held by us which are used or held for use in our trade or business. Currently, the fair market value of our “United States real property interests” is significantly below the 50% threshold. However, in order to assure compliance with the FIRPTA covenant, we may be limited with respect to the business opportunities we may pursue, particularly if the business opportunities would increase the amounts of “United States real property interests” owned by us or decrease the amount of other assets owned by us. In addition, we may take proactive steps to avoid our capital stock being deemed “United States real property interest”, including, but not limited to, (a) a sale-leaseback transaction with respect to some or all of our real property interests, or (b) the formation of a holding company organized under the laws of the Republic of Singapore which would issue shares of its capital stock in exchange for all of our outstanding stock (this reorganization would require the submission of that transaction to our stockholders for their approval and the consummation of that exchange). We will take these actions only if such actions are commercially reasonable for Equinix and our stockholders. Our non-U.S. customers include numerous related parties of i-STT. In the past, a substantial portion of i-STT’s financing, as well as its revenues, has been derived from its affiliates, including STT Communications. We continue to have contractual and other business relationships and may engage in material transactions with affiliates of STT Communications. Circumstances may arise in which the interests of STT Communications’ affiliates may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. In addition, entities affiliated with STT Communications make investments in various companies; they have invested in the past, and may invest in the future, in entities that compete with us. In the context of negotiating commercial arrangements with affiliates, conflicts of interest have arisen in the past and may arise, in this or other contexts, in the future. We cannot assure you that any conflicts of interest will be resolved in our favor. A significant number of shares of our capital stock have been issued during 2002, 2003 and 2004 and may be sold in the market in the near future. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well. We issued a large number of shares of our capital stock to the former Pihana stockholders, STT Communications, and holders of our senior notes in connection with the combination, financing and senior note exchange, to Crosslink Capital, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, “Crosslink”) in connection with Crosslink’s purchase of our Series A-2 Convertible Secured Notes, and to the public and STT Communications in connection with our follow-on equity offering in late 2003. The shares of common stock issued in the senior note exchange are currently freely tradeable. The shares of common stock issued in connection with the combination have been 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements registered for resale as of June 30, 2003, the shares of common stock issued upon exercise of the warrants issued in connection with the Crosslink financing have been registered for resale as of September 22, 2003 and the shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the convertible secured notes issued in the Crosslink financing have been registered for resale as of July 30, 2004. The shares sold to the public and STT Communications in connection with our follow-on equity offering in November 2003 are freely tradeable by the public, subject, in the case of STT Communications, to compliance with Rule 144 resale restrictions applicable to affiliates. In February 2004, we issued $86,250,000 of 2.5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2024. These debentures are convertible into 2,183,548 shares of our common stock. Holders of these debentures may convert their debentures into shares of our common stock during any calendar quarter if the sale price of our common stock is greater than or equal to 120% of the conversion price per share of our common stock for 20 out of any 30 consecutive trading days or if the trading price of our debentures falls below specified prices. All of these shares are eligible for resale pursuant to a registration statement that became effective on July 30, 2004. In January 2005, 95% of STT Communications’ outstanding convertible secured notes and associated interest were converted into shares of our non-voting Series A-1 preferred stock. In February 2005, STT Communications elected to convert all of the shares of Series A-1 preferred stock into 4.1 million shares of our common stock. The shares of common stock are eligible for resale pursuant to a registration statement that became effective on December 22, 2004. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by these parties within any narrow period of time could cause our stock price to fall. In addition, the issuance of the additional shares of our common stock as a result of these transactions will reduce our earnings per share, if any. This dilution could reduce the market price of our common stock unless and until we achieve revenue growth or cost savings and other business economies sufficient to offset the effect of this issuance. We cannot assure you that we will achieve revenue growth, cost savings or other business economies. A significant number of our shares may be sold into the public market if STT Communications defaults on its credit facility, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly. As of December 31, 2004, STT Communications held 2,970,414 shares of our common stock and held securities convertible into 7,025,534 additional shares of our common stock. STT Communications has pledged to its lenders its ownership interest in the majority of its secured notes and warrants purchased in the financing and its common and preferred stock issued in the combination as collateral for its secured credit facility. If STT Communications defaults on its credit facility, the stock, warrants and secured notes owned by STT Communications could be transferred to its lenders or sold to third parties. In the event of default, the new owner of the secured notes, stock and warrants could convert them into our common stock and sell them, along with the common stock, into the public market. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by these parties within any narrow period of time could cause our stock price to fall. In addition, the issuance of the additional shares of our common stock as a result of these transactions will reduce our earnings per share, if any. We depend on a number of third parties to provide Internet connectivity to our IBX centers; if connectivity is interrupted or terminated, our operating results and cash flow could be materially adversely affected. The presence of diverse telecommunications carriers’ fiber networks in our IBX centers is critical to our ability to attract new customers. We believe that the availability of carrier capacity will directly affect our ability to achieve our projected results. We are not a telecommunications carrier, and as such we rely on third parties to provide our customers with carrier services. We rely primarily on revenue opportunities from the telecommunications carriers’ customers to encourage them to invest the capital and operating resources required to build facilities from their locations to our IBX centers. Carriers will likely evaluate the revenue opportunity of an IBX center based on the assumption that the environment will be highly competitive. We cannot assure you that any carrier will elect to offer its services within our IBX centers or that once a carrier has decided to provide Internet connectivity to our IBX centers that it will continue to do so for any period of time. 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The construction required to connect multiple carrier facilities to our IBX centers is complex and involves factors outside of our control, including regulatory processes and the availability of construction resources. If the establishment of highly diverse Internet connectivity to our IBX centers does not occur or is materially delayed or is discontinued, our operating results and cash flow will be adversely affected. Further, many carriers are experiencing business difficulties or announcing consolidations. As a result, some carriers may be forced to downsize or terminate connectivity within our IBX centers. Any failure of our physical infrastructure or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce our revenue and harm our business reputation and financial results. Our business depends on providing customers with highly reliable service. We must protect customers’ IBX infrastructure and customers’ equipment located in our IBX centers. We have recently acquired long-term leases to three IBX centers not built by us. If these recently leased IBX centers and their infrastructure assets are not in the condition we believe them to be in, we may be required to incur substantial additional costs to repair or upgrade the facilities. The services we provide in each of our IBX centers, whether recently acquired or not, are subject to failure resulting from numerous factors, including: • human error; • physical or electronic security breaches; • fire, earthquake, flood and other natural disasters; • water damage; • power loss; • sabotage and vandalism; and • failure of business partners who provide the combined company’s resale products. Problems at one or more of our IBX centers, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions or significant equipment damage. We have service level commitment obligations to certain of our customers. As a result, service interruptions or significant equipment damage in our IBX centers could result in difficulty maintaining service level commitments to these customers. In the past, a limited number of our customers have experienced temporary losses of power and failure of our services levels on products such as bandwidth connectivity. If we incur significant financial commitments to our customers in connection with a loss of power, or our failure to meet other service level commitment obligations, our liability insurance may not be adequate to cover those expenses. In addition, any loss of services, equipment damage or inability to meet our service level commitment obligations, particularly in the early stage of our development, could reduce the confidence of our customers and could consequently impair our ability to obtain and retain customers, which would adversely affect both our ability to generate revenues and our operating results. Furthermore, we are dependent upon Internet service providers, telecommunications carriers and other website operators in the U.S., Asia and elsewhere, some of which may have experienced significant system failures and electrical outages in the past. Users of our services may in the future experience difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems and services. If for any reason, these providers fail to provide the required services, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. A portion of the managed services business we acquired in the combination involves the processing and storage of confidential customer information. Inappropriate use of those services could jeopardize the security of customers’ confidential information causing losses of data or financially impacting us or our customers. Efforts to alleviate problems caused by computer viruses or other inappropriate uses or security breaches may lead to interruptions, delays or cessation of our managed services. 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements There is no known prevention or defense against denial of service attacks. During a prolonged denial of service attack, Internet service may not be available for several hours, thus impacting hosted customers’ on-line business transactions. Affected customers might file claims against us under such circumstances. Our property and liability insurance may not be adequate to cover these customer claims. We resell products and services of third parties that may require us to pay for such services even if our customers fail to pay us for the services, which may have a negative impact on our operating results. In order to provide resale services such as bandwidth, managed services and other network management services, we will contract with third party service providers. These services require us to enter into fixed term contracts for services with third party suppliers of products and services. If we experience the loss of a customer who has purchased a resale product, we will remain obligated to continue to pay our suppliers for the term of the underlying contracts. The payment of these obligations without a corresponding payment from customers will reduce our financial resources and may have a material adverse affect on our financial performance and operating results. IBM accounts for a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of IBM as a customer could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, IBM accounted for 13%, 15% and 20%, respectively, of our revenue. We expect that IBM will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future, although we expect revenues received from IBM to decline as a percentage of our total revenues as we add new customers in our IBX centers. Although the term of our IBM contract runs through 2009, IBM currently has the right to reduce its commitment to us pursuant to the terms and requirements of its customer agreement. If we lose IBM as a customer, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Our IBX centers and other products and services must be able to differentiate themselves from existing providers of space and services for telecommunications companies, web hosting companies and other colocation providers. In addition to competing with neutral colocation providers, we must compete with traditional colocation providers, including local phone companies, long distance phone companies, Internet service providers and web hosting facilities. Likewise, with respect to our other products and services, including managed services, bandwidth services and security services, we must compete with more established providers of similar services. Most of these companies have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than us. Because of their greater financial resources, some of our competitors have the ability to adopt aggressive pricing policies, especially if they have been able to restructure their debt or other obligations. As a result, in the future, we may suffer from pricing pressure that would adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, these competitors could offer colocation on neutral terms, and may start doing so in the same metropolitan areas where we have IBX centers. Some of these competitors may also provide our target customers with additional benefits, including bundled communication services, and may do so in a manner that is more attractive to our potential customers than obtaining space in our IBX centers. We believe our neutrality provides us with an advantage over these competitors. However, if these competitors were able to adopt aggressive pricing policies together with offering colocation space, our ability to generate revenues would be materially adversely affected. We may also face competition from persons seeking to replicate our IBX concept by building new centers or converting existing centers that some of our competitors are in the process of divesting. We may experience competition from our landlords in this regard. Rather than leasing available space in our buildings to large single 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements tenants, they may decide to convert the space instead to smaller square foot units designed for multi-tenant colocation use. Landlords may enjoy a cost effective advantage in providing similar services as our IBXs, and this could also reduce the amount of space available to us for expansion in the future. Competitors may operate more successfully or form alliances to acquire significant market share. Furthermore, enterprises that have already invested substantial resources in outsourcing arrangements may be reluctant or slow to adopt our approach that may replace, limit or compete with their existing systems. In addition, other companies may be able to attract the same potential customers that we are targeting. Once customers are located in competitors’ facilities, it may be extremely difficult to convince them to relocate to our IBX centers. Our success in retaining key employees and discouraging them from moving to a competitor is an important factor in our ability to remain competitive. As is common in our industry, our employees are typically compensated through grants of stock options in addition to their regular salaries. We occasionally grant new stock options to employees as an incentive to remain with the company. To the extent we are unable to adequately maintain these stock option incentives and should employees decide to leave the company, this may be disruptive to our business and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because we depend on the development and growth of a balanced customer base, failure to attract and retain this base of customers could harm our business and operating results. Our ability to maximize revenues depends on our ability to develop and grow a balanced customer base, consisting of a variety of companies, including network service providers, site and performance management companies, and enterprise and content companies. The more balanced the customer base within each IBX hub, the better we will be able to generate significant interconnection revenues, which in turn increases our overall revenues. Our ability to attract customers to our IBX centers will depend on a variety of factors, including the presence of multiple carriers, the mix of products and services offered by us, the overall mix of customers, the IBX hub’s operating reliability and security and our ability to effectively market our services. In addition, some of our customers are and will continue to be Internet companies that face many competitive pressures and that may not ultimately be successful. If these customers do not succeed, they will not continue to use the IBX centers. This may be disruptive to our business and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our products and services have a long sales cycle that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A customer’s decision to license cabinet space in one of our IBX centers and to purchase additional services typically involves a significant commitment of resources. In addition, some customers will be reluctant to commit to locating in our IBX centers until they are confident that the IBX center has adequate carrier connections. As a result, we have a long sales cycle. Delays due to the length our sales cycle may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to securities class action litigation, which may harm our business and results of operations. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. During the quarter ended September 30, 2001, putative shareholder class action lawsuits were filed against us, a number of our officers and directors, and several investment banks that were underwriters of our initial public offering. The suits allege that the underwriter defendants agreed to allocate stock in our initial public offering to certain investors in exchange for excessive and undisclosed commissions and agreements by those investors to make additional purchases in the aftermarket at pre-determined prices. Plaintiffs allege that the prospectus for our initial public offering was false and misleading and in violation of the securities laws because it did not disclose these arrangements. In July 2003, a special litigation committee of our board of directors agreed to participate in a settlement with the plaintiffs. The settlement agreement is subject to court approval and sufficient participation by defendants in similar actions. If the 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements proposed settlement is not approved by the court or a sufficient number of defendants do not participate in the settlement, the defense of this litigation may continue and therefore increase our expenses and divert management’s attention and resources. An adverse outcome in this litigation could seriously harm our business and results of operations. In addition, we may, in the future, be subject to other securities class action or similar litigation. Risks Related to Our Industry If the use of the Internet and electronic business does not grow, our revenues may not grow. Acceptance and use of the Internet may not continue to develop at historical rates and a sufficiently broad base of consumers may not adopt or continue to use the Internet and other online services as a medium of commerce. Demand for Internet services and products are subject to a high level of uncertainty and are subject to significant pricing pressure, especially in Asia-Pacific. As a result, we cannot be certain that a viable market for our IBX centers will materialize. If the market for our IBX centers grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, our revenues may not grow and our operating results could suffer. Government regulation may adversely affect the use of the Internet and our business. Various laws and governmental regulations governing Internet related services, related communications services and information technologies, and electronic commerce remain largely unsettled, even in areas where there has been some legislative action. This is true both in the U.S. and the various foreign countries in which we operate. It may take years to determine whether and how existing laws, such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel, telecommunications services, and taxation, apply to the Internet and to related services such as ours. We have limited experience with such international regulatory issues and substantial resources may be required to comply with regulations or bring any non-compliant business practices into compliance with such regulations. In addition, the development of the market for online commerce and the displacement of traditional telephony service by the Internet and related communications services may prompt an increased call for more stringent consumer protection laws or other regulation both in the U.S. and abroad that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online and their service providers. The compliance with, adoption or modification of, laws or regulations relating to the Internet, or interpretations of existing laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Industry consolidation may have a negative impact on our business model. The telecommunications industry is currently undergoing a consolidation. As customers combine businesses, they may require less colocation space, and there may be fewer networks available to choose from. Given the competitive and evolving nature of this industry, further consolidation of our customers and/or our competitors may present a risk to our network neutral business model and have a negative impact on our revenues. Terrorist activity throughout the world and military action to counter terrorism could adversely impact our business. The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the U.S., the ensuing declaration of war on terrorism and the continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war or hostility appear to be having an adverse effect on business, financial and general economic conditions internationally. These effects may, in turn, increase our costs due to the need to provide enhanced security, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. These circumstances may also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, our ability to raise capital and the operation and maintenance of our IBX centers. We may not have adequate property and liability insurance to cover such catastrophic events or attacks. 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, or FIN 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51.” FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB released a revised version of FIN 46 clarifying certain aspects of FIN 46 and providing certain entities with exemptions from the requirements of FIN 46. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period ending after March 15, 2004. The adoption of FIN 46 did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances) because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer. In November 2003, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FASB 150-3 which deferred the measurement provisions of SFAS No. 150 indefinitely for certain mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interests that were issued before November 5, 2003. The FASB plans to reconsider implementation issues and, perhaps, classification or measurement guidance for those non-controlling interests during the deferral period. In 2003, we applied certain disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 150. To date, the impact of the effective provisions of SFAS No. 150 have not had a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. While the effective date of certain elements of SFAS No. 150 have been deferred, the adoption of SFAS No. 150 when finalized is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2004, the FASB approved EITF Issue 03-6 “Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method under FAS 128.” EITF Issue 03-6 supersedes the guidance in Topic No. D-95, “Effect of Participating Convertible Securities on the Computation of Basic Earnings per Share”, and requires the use of the two-class method of participating securities. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. In addition, EITF Issue 03-6 addresses other forms of participating securities, including options, warrants, forwards and other contracts to issue an entity’s common stock, with the exception of stock-based compensation (unvested options and restricted stock) subject to the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and FASB No. 123. EITF Issue 03-6 is effective for reporting periods beginning after March 31, 2004 and should be applied by restating previously reported earnings per share. We adopted the provisions of EITF Issue 03-6 during the second quarter of 2004. The adoption of EITF Issue 03-6 did not have a material effect on our basic and diluted net loss per share data at this time. In June 2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue 03-1 “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.” EITF Issue 03-1 establishes a common approach to evaluating other-than-temporary impairment to investments in an effort to reduce the ambiguity in impairment methodology found in APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock” and FASB No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”, which has resulted in inconsistent application. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF Issue 03-1-1, which deferred the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance clarified in EITF Issue 03-1 indefinitely; however, the disclosure requirements remain effective for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004. While the effective date for certain elements of EITF Issue 03-1 have been deferred, the adoption of EITF Issue 03-1 when finalized in its current form is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In November 2004, the FASB approved EITF Issue 04-8 “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings per Share.” EITF Issue 04-8 addresses when contingently convertible instruments should be included in diluted earnings per share. For purposes of EITF Issue 04-8, contingently convertible instruments are instruments that have embedded conversion features that are contingently convertible or exercisable based on (a) a market price trigger or (b) multiple contingencies if one of the contingencies is a market price trigger and the instrument can be converted or share settled based on meeting the specified market condition. EITF Issue 04-8 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2004 and should be applied by restating previously reported earnings per share data. We adopted the provisions of EITF Issue 04-8 during the fourth quarter of 2004. The adoption of EITF Issue 04-8 did not have a material effect on our diluted net loss per share data at this time. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No. 123(R) revises SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock-based compensation, such as employee stock purchase plans and restricted stock awards. In addition, SFAS No. 123(R) supercedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and amends SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.” Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), stock-based compensation awards must meet certain criteria in order for the award to qualify for equity classification. An award that does not meet those criteria will be classified as a liability and be remeasured each period. SFAS No. 123(R) retains the requirements on accounting for the income tax effects of stock-based compensation contained in SFAS No. 123; however, it changes how excess tax benefits will be presented in the statement of cash flows. SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005. Senior management is currently considering the financial accounting, income tax and internal control implications of SFAS No. 123(R). The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) is expected to have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29.” SFAS No. 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets. It eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets contained in APB Opinion No. 29 and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of an entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. As the provisions of SFAS No. 153 are to be applied prospectively, the adoption of SFAS No. 153 will not have an impact on our historical financial statements; however, we will assess the impact of the adoption of this pronouncement on any future nonmonetary transactions that we enter into, if any. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk The following discussion about market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent we are exposed to fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity. In the past, we have employed foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging certain specifically identified net currency exposures. The use of these financial instruments was intended to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, but does not eliminate such risks. We may decide to employ such contracts again in the future. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Interest Rate Risk The Company’s exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. All of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale and are therefore recorded at fair market value on our balance sheet with the unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income. The fair market value of our marketable securities could be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, but we do not believe such impact would be material. Securities with longer maturities are subject to a greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities and at December 31, 2004 our portfolio maturity was relatively short. If current interest rates were to increase or decrease by 10%, the fair market value of our investment portfolio could increase or decrease by $120,000. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates would furthermore not have a material impact to our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of our long-term debt obligation. However, the interest expense associated with our $25.0 million revolving credit line, which bears interest at floating rates, plus applicable margins, based on either the prime rate or LIBOR could be affected. As of December 31, 2004, the $25.0 million revolving credit line had an effective interest rate of 4.40%; however, through the date of filing of this report on Form 10-K, no drawings are outstanding under this line of credit. The fair market value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate changes may affect the fair market value of the fixed interest rate debt but does not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair market value of our convertible subordinated debentures is based on quoted market prices. The estimated fair value of our convertible subordinated debentures as of December 31, 2004 was approximately $106.2 million. Foreign Currency Risk Prior to December 31, 2002, all of our recognized revenue had been denominated in U.S. dollars, generated mostly from customers in the U.S., and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had been minimal. However, commencing in fiscal 2003, as a result of the combination, approximately 15% of our revenues and approximately 18% of our costs were in the Asia-Pacific region, and a large portion of those revenues and costs were denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Singapore dollar, Japanese yen and Hong Kong and Australian dollars. As a result, our operating results and cash flows will be impacted due to currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. Going forward, we continue to expect that approximately 15% of our revenues and costs will continue to be generated and incurred in the Asia-Pacific region in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, similar to 2003. Furthermore, to the extent that our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our services less competitive in the international markets. Although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations, and when appropriate, may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations, there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future. Commodity Price Risk Certain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of significant price changes are electricity and supplies and equipment used in our IBX centers. We are closely monitoring the cost of electricity, particularly in California. We do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk.",2023-12-30 20:27:58.454172
1101239,EQIX,EQUINIX INC,2006,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information in this discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements are based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. For example, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Overview Equinix provides network neutral colocation, interconnection and managed services to enterprises, content companies, systems integrators and the world’s largest network providers. Through our IBX centers in eleven markets in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific, customers can directly interconnect with each other for critical traffic exchange requirements. As of December 31, 2005, we had announced IBX centers in Chicago, Dallas, Honolulu, Los Angeles, New York, Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. areas in the United States and Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo in the Asia-Pacific region. Direct interconnection to our aggregation of networks, which serve more than 90% of the world’s Internet routes, allows our customers to increase performance while significantly reducing costs. Based on our network neutral model and the quality of our IBX centers, we believe we have established a critical mass of customers. As more customers locate in our IBX centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to do so as well to gain the full economic and performance benefits of direct interconnection. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a “network effect” of customer adoption. Our interconnection services enable scalable, reliable and cost-effective interconnection and traffic exchange thus lowering overall cost and increasing flexibility. Our focused business model is based on our critical mass of customers and the resulting network effect. This critical mass and the resulting “network effect”, combined with our strong financial position, continue to drive new customer growth and bookings. Historically, our market has been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled their telecommunication products and services with their colocation offerings. A number of these telecommunications carriers have eliminated or reduced their colocation footprint to focus on their core businesses. In 2003, as an example, one major telecommunications company, Sprint, announced its plans to exit the colocation and hosting market in order to focus on its core service offerings, while another telecommunications company, Cable & Wireless Plc, sold its U.S. assets to another telecommunications company, Savvis Communications Corp, in a bankruptcy auction. In 2005, other providers, such as Abovenet and Verio, have selectively sold off certain of their colocation centers. Each of these colocation providers own and operate a network. We do not own or operate a network, yet have greater than 200 networks operating out of our IBX centers. As a result, we are able to offer our customers a substantial choice of networks given our network neutrality thereby allowing our customers to choose from numerous network service providers. We believe this is a distinct and sustainable competitive advantage, especially when the telecommunications industry is experiencing many business challenges and changes as evidenced by the numerous bankruptcies and consolidations within this industry during the past several years. Furthermore, this industry consolidation has constrained the supply of suitable data center space and has had a stabilizing effect on industry pricing. 27 Table of Contents Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and service offerings, such as our acquisition of the Sprint property in Santa Clara in December 2003, our 2004 expansions in the Washington, D.C. and Silicon Valley metro area markets, our 2005 expansions in the Silicon Valley, Chicago and Los Angeles metro area markets and our 2006 announcements on our intention to build new IBX centers in the Washington, D.C. and Chicago metro areas (see “Recent Developments” below). However, we will continue to be very selective with any similar opportunity. As was the case with these recent expansions in the Washington, D.C., Silicon Valley, Chicago and Los Angeles area markets, our expansion criteria will be dependent on demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, capacity availability in current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to breakeven and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive for us. Dependent on the particular deal, these acquisitions may require upfront cash payments and additional capital expenditures or may be funded through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these centers up to Equinix standards. Property expansion may be in the form of a purchase of real property, as was the case with our recent Ashburn campus property acquisition, or a long-term leasing arrangement. In addition to our successful strategy of acquiring previously or partially built-out centers, we are also contemplating the possibility of new construction in selective markets where the inventory for high quality data centers is limited, such as our recent announcements on our intention to build new IBX centers in the Washington, D.C. and Chicago metro areas. Decisions to build will consider factors such as customer demand, market pricing and the financial returns associated with the construction. Future purchases or construction may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash. Recent Developments In January 2005, we converted 95% of the outstanding convertible secured notes and unpaid interest, held by STT Communications Ltd., into 4.1 million shares of our preferred stock, which was subsequently converted into 4.1 million shares of our common stock in February 2005. We refer to this transaction as the STT convertible secured notes conversion. The remaining 5% of the convertible secured notes outstanding, totaling $1.9 million, was converted in November 2005 (see below). In February 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the issuance of 320,500 shares of restricted shares of common stock to executive officers. Prior to this, we had not granted any restricted shares. These restricted shares are subject to four-year vesting, and will only vest if the stock appreciates to certain pre-determined levels. These restricted shares are a compensatory plan under the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and are accounted for as variable awards. As a result, compensation cost will be adjusted for changes in the market price of our common stock until the restricted shares become vested. On the date of grant of the restricted shares in February 2005, we recorded a $14.4 million deferred stock-based compensation charge. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a reduction in deferred stock-based compensation of $3.3 million as a result of a declining stock price and forfeitures and recorded $6.5 million of stock-based compensation expense related to these restricted shares for the year ended December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, there was a total of $4.6 million of deferred stock-based compensation remaining to be amortized related to these restricted shares. We expect stock-based compensation expense related to these restricted shares to impact our results of operations through 2008. In June 2005, we entered into a long-term lease for a 120,000 square foot data center in the Silicon Valley area. We refer to this transaction as the Sunnyvale IBX acquisition. This center will be interconnected to our three other Silicon Valley area IBX centers through redundant dark fiber links that will be managed by us to allow customers in each center to leverage the benefits of directly interconnecting with other customers in the other centers. Payments under this lease, which qualifies as an operating lease, total $45.3 million, which will be paid in monthly installments, which commenced in October 2005 and will be payable through September 2020. We intend to begin placing customers in this IBX center in mid-2006. We intend to invest approximately $14.2 million of capital expenditures to upgrade this center to Equinix standards, of which $2.1 million was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2005. 28 Table of Contents In July 2005, we entered into a (i) long-term sublease of a 107,000 square foot data center in the Chicago metro area and (ii) an asset purchase agreement to purchase the IBX plant and machinery assets located within this new IBX center from Verio. We refer to this transaction as the Chicago IBX acquisition. This center is in the same building as our existing Chicago IBX center, which it will be interconnected to in order to leverage existing networks and customers. Payments due to Verio for the Chicago IBX acquisition total $25.2 million, of which $1.9 million was paid in two lump-sum payments in 2005 and the remaining $23.3 million will be paid in monthly installments, which commenced in November 2005 and will be payable through August 2015. We accounted for the Chicago IBX acquisition as a single accounting arrangement with multiple elements. As a result, we assessed the fair value of both the building and equipment elements and then assigned the relative fair value to each element. We have determined that the building component of the Chicago IBX acquisition is a long-term operating lease and the equipment portion of the transaction represents a financed asset purchase. We took possession of this property and took title to the equipment in November 2005, and as a result, recorded IBX equipment assets, as well as a financing obligation liability, totaling $9.7 million at that time. Payments for the equipment portion of this transaction, to be recorded as financed assets, are payable monthly, which commenced November 2005 and will be payable through August 2015, at an effective interest rate of approximately 7.50% per annum. Payments for the building portion of this transaction, which is an operating lease, are also payable monthly, which commenced November 2005 and will be payable through August 2015, and total approximately $11.7 million in cumulative lease payments. We intend to begin placing customers in this IBX center in the first half of 2006. We intend to invest approximately $17.0 million of capital expenditures to upgrade this center to Equinix standards, of which $5.8 million was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2005. In September 2005, we purchased a 107,000 square foot data center in the Los Angeles metro area, which is comprised of the building, building improvements and land. We refer to this transaction as the Los Angeles IBX acquisition. This center will be interconnected with dark fiber to our existing two IBX centers in the downtown Los Angeles area. The total purchase price for the Los Angeles IBX acquisition, including closing costs, totaled $34.7 million, which we paid for in full with cash in September 2005. We assessed the fair value of the building, building improvements and land elements of the Los Angeles IBX acquisition and then assigned the relative fair value to each element when we recorded this transaction in September 2005. In October 2005, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell this Los Angeles IBX for $38.7 million and to lease it back from the purchaser pursuant to a long-term lease, which closed in December 2005 and we received proceeds from the sale of this property of $38.1 million, which was net of closing costs. However, due to our continuing involvement in regards to certain aspects of this property, the sale and leaseback of this property does not qualify as a sale-leaseback under generally accepted accounting principles, but rather is accounted for as a financing of the property. We refer to this portion of the transaction as the Los Angeles IBX financing. Pursuant to the Los Angeles IBX financing, we recorded a financing obligation liability totaling $38.1 million in December 2005. Payments under the Los Angeles IBX financing are payable monthly, which commenced in January 2006 and will be payable through December 2025, at an effective interest rate of approximately 7.75% per annum. We currently intend to begin placing customers in this center during the first half of 2006. Pursuant to the terms of the lease for the Los Angeles IBX, we are required to invest approximately $14.0 million of capital expenditures to upgrade this center to Equinix standards, of which $3.7 million was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2005 and the remainder will be incurred during 2006. In September 2005, we entered into a $50.0 million revolving line of credit agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, replacing the previously outstanding $25.0 million line of credit arrangement with the same bank. The new $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line has a three-year commitment, which enables us to borrow, repay and re-borrow the full amount, up to September 15, 2008. We refer to this transaction as the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. Borrowings under the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line bear interest at floating interest rates, plus applicable margins, based either on the prime rate or LIBOR. In October 2005, we elected to borrow $30.0 million from the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line, which we refer to as the $30.0 million drawdown. The $30.0 million drawdown was paid back in full in January 2006. The $30.0 million drawdown was used to fund a portion of the purchase of the Ashburn campus property acquisition (see below). As of December 31, 2005, the $50.0 million Silicon Valley 29 Table of Contents Bank revolving credit line had an interest rate of 6.12% per annum. The $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line also features sublimits, which allow us to issue letters of credit, enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and make advances for cash management services. Our utilization under any of these sublimits would have the effect of reducing the amount available for borrowing under the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line during the period that such sublimits remain utilized and outstanding. As of December 31, 2005, in addition to the $30.0 million drawdown described above, we had utilized $6.7 million of the credit line through the issuance of letters of credit, and, as a result, we had $13.3 million remaining available for borrowing under the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. The $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line is collateralized by substantially all of our domestic assets and contains several financial covenants which require compliance with maximum leverage ratios, working capital ratios and a minimum EBITDA target, which we were in full compliance with as of December 31, 2005. The $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line provides us with additional liquidity and financing flexibility. In October 2005, we purchased an office/warehouse complex known as the Beaumeade Business Park located in Ashburn, Virginia, which we refer to as the Ashburn campus. We purchased the entire 32.6-acre Ashburn campus, which contains six buildings with approximately 462,000 rentable square feet, and was approximately 95% leased. We refer to this transaction as the Ashburn campus property acquisition. We currently occupy approximately 269,000 square feet within three of the buildings. The total purchase price for the Ashburn campus, including closing costs, was $53.7 million, which the Company paid for in full in October 2005. We will continue to operate our existing data centers within the Ashburn campus. For those buildings that we do not occupy, we collect rental income from the current tenants and are evaluating these buildings in regards to our future expansion plans. We may decide to sell those buildings that will not be used for our current operations or expansion plans in the future. In addition, we entered into a mortgage transaction to finance the Ashburn campus. The financing totals $60.0 million at 8% and will be amortized over 20 years. We refer to this transaction as the Ashburn campus financing. The Ashburn campus financing closed in December 2005, and as a result, we received $60.0 million in cash proceeds and recorded a $60.0 million mortgage payable at that time. Payments for the Ashburn campus financing are payable monthly, which commenced February 2006 and will be payable through January 2026. The Ashburn campus financing is collateralized by the Ashburn campus property and related assets. Pursuant to the terms of the Ashburn campus financing, we have agreed to invest at least $40.0 million in capital improvements to the Ashburn campus by December 31, 2007. In October 2005, in light of the availability of fully or partially built-out data centers in the Silicon Valley, including the possibility of expansion among some of the four IBX centers we currently have in the Silicon Valley, we made the decision to exit the approximately 40 acre San Jose ground lease because opportunities for future expansion were no longer economical. In conjunction with this decision, we entered into an agreement with the landlord of this property for an early termination of the San Jose ground lease whereby we will pay $40.0 million over the next four years, commencing January 1, 2006, to terminate this lease, which would otherwise require significantly higher cumulative lease payments through 2020. We refer to this transaction as the San Jose ground lease termination. As a result of the San Jose ground lease termination, we recorded a $33.8 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2005, which represents the present value of our estimated future cash payments to exit this property, as well as the write-off of all remaining property and equipment attributed to the development of this property. In November 2005, STT Communications elected to convert the remaining convertible secured notes and unpaid interest, which remained after the 95% STT convertible secured notes conversion in January 2005, into 240,578 shares of our preferred stock. On the same date, STT Communications also exercised their outstanding preferred stock warrant for 965,674 shares of our preferred stock, resulting in $10,000 of cash proceeds to us and simultaneously converted all such preferred stock, including the 1,868,667 shares of our preferred stock that they had previously held, into 3,074,919 shares of our common stock. The conversion activity was done in connection with STT Communications’ decision to divest itself of its holdings in our securities as they determined that we were no longer a core asset after re-assessing their strategic goals and objectives. We refer to this transaction as the STT divestiture. The STT divestiture was completed in November 2005. 30 Table of Contents In January 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved stock options to be granted to employees, excluding executive officers, to purchase an aggregate of 648,500 shares of common stock as part of our annual refresh program. The actual grant date and the exercise price of such stock options are expected to be determined sometime in March 2006. In addition, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors also approved the issuance of 250,000 shares of restricted shares of common stock to executive officers. The restricted shares are subject to four-year vesting, and will only vest if the stock appreciates at pre-determined levels. All such equity awards will be accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” and related pronouncements, which are expected to have a significant impact to us. We expect stock-based compensation expense related to these equity awards to impact our results of operations through 2009. For further information on stock-based compensation, refer to “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below. In February 2006, we announced our intention to build out a new IBX center within the Ashburn campus property in order to further expand our existing Washington, D.C. metro area IBX center. We intend to build out one of the undeveloped buildings located on the Ashburn campus property for a cost of approximately $50.0 to $55.0 million, of which approximately $40.0 million is expected to be incurred in 2006. The center will feature an updated design that will enable us to support the increased power and cooling demands of customers. We intend to open the new center for customers in early 2007. We refer to this project as the Washington, D.C. metro area IBX expansion project. The Washington, D.C. metro area IBX expansion project will fulfill our requirement to invest at least $40.0 million in capital improvements to the Ashburn campus by December 31, 2007 pursuant to the terms of the Ashburn campus financing. In February 2006, we entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement to purchase a vacant 228,000 square foot standalone office/warehouse complex in the Chicago metro area for $9.8 million, payable upon closing. The agreement is subject to numerous closing conditions, including the satisfactory completion by us of a comprehensive due diligence review of the property. As part of the evaluation process, we are considering several partnering and financing options for building out this center and are also evaluating options to build out this center in a phased approach. A new center would be interconnected to our downtown Chicago IBX center through redundant dark fiber links managed by us. We refer to this project as the Chicago metro area IBX expansion project. If we purchase this building, additional significant capital expenditures would be required in order to build out a new IBX center on this property. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: • Revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts; • Accounting for income taxes; • Estimated and contingent liabilities; • Accounting for property and equipment; • Impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill; 31 Table of Contents • Accounting for asset retirement obligations; • Accounting for leases and IBX acquisitions; • Accounting for restructuring charges; and • Accounting for stock-based compensation. Revenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We derive more than 90% of our revenues from recurring revenue streams, consisting primarily of (1) colocation services, such as from the licensing of cabinet space and power; (2) interconnection services, such as cross connects and Gigabit Ethernet ports to connect customers within our centers; (3) managed infrastructure services, such as Equinix Direct, bandwidth, mail service and managed platform solutions and (4) other services consisting of rent from non-IBX space. The remainder of our revenues are from non-recurring revenue streams, such as from the recognized portion of deferred installation revenues, professional services, contract settlements and equipment sales. Revenues from recurring revenue streams are billed monthly and recognized ratably over the term of the contract, generally one to three years for IBX space customers. Non-recurring installation fees, although generally paid in a lump sum upon installation, are deferred and recognized ratably over the greater of the term of the related contract or expected customer relationship. Professional service fees are recognized in the period in which the services were provided and represent the culmination of the earnings process as long as they meet the criteria for separate recognition under EITF Abstract No. 00-21, “Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” Revenue from bandwidth and equipment is recognized on a gross basis in accordance with EITF Abstract No. 99-19, “Recording Revenue as a Principal versus Net as an Agent”, primarily because we act as the principal in the transaction, take title to products and services and bear inventory and credit risk. To the extent we do not meet the criteria for gross basis accounting for bandwidth and equipment revenue, we record the revenue on a net basis. Revenue from contract settlements is generally recognized on a cash basis when collectible and no remaining performance obligations exist to the extent that the revenue has not previously been recognized. We occasionally guarantee certain service levels, such as uptime, as outlined in individual customer contracts. To the extent that these service levels are not achieved, we reduce revenue for any credits given to the customer as a result. We generally have the ability to determine such service level credits prior to the associated revenue being recognized, and historically, these credits have not been significant; however, during the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a total of $457,000 in service level credits to various customers primarily in connection with two separate power outages that affected our Chicago and Washington, D.C. metro area IBX centers. Revenue is recognized only when the service has been provided and when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured. It is customary business practice to obtain a signed master sales agreement and sales order prior to recognizing revenue in an arrangement. We assess collection based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the credit-worthiness of the customer. We generally do not request collateral from our customers, although in certain cases we obtain a security interest in a customer’s equipment placed in our IBX centers or obtain a deposit. If we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured, we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. In addition, we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments for those customers that we had expected to collect the revenues. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they become insolvent, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, allowances for doubtful accounts may be required. Management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and current economic news and trends, historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating revenue recognition and the adequacy of our reserves. A specific bad debt reserve of up to the full amount of a particular invoice value is provided for certain problematic customer balances. A general reserve is established for all other accounts based on the age of the invoices. Delinquent account balances are written-off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable. 32 Table of Contents A significant portion of our customer base is comprised of businesses throughout the U.S. However, a portion of our revenues is derived from our Asia-Pacific operations. For the year ended December 31, 2003 our revenues were split approximately 85% in the U.S. and 15% in Asia-Pacific. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, our revenues were split approximately 87% in the U.S. and 13% in Asia- Pacific. As of December 31, 2005, one customer, IBM, accounted for 11% of annual revenues and 12% of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2004, this same customer accounted for 13% of annual revenues and 12% of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2003, this same customer accounted for 15% of annual revenues and 11% of accounts receivable. No other single customer accounted for greater than 10% of accounts receivable or annual revenues for the periods presented. Historically, a significant portion of our non-recurring revenues are derived from the amortization of deferred installation fees. These non-recurring installation fees, although generally paid in a lump sum upon installation, are deferred and recognized ratably over the greater of the term of the related contract or expected customer relationship. This amortization period represents a significant management estimate, since we are required to estimate the expected life of our customer relationships in order to determine the appropriate length of the amortization period. Should management determine that our expected customer lives are less than originally anticipated, additional amortization would be required, which would increase revenues in the period such determination was made. Conversely, should management determine that our expected customer lives are greater than originally anticipated, less amortization would be required, which would decrease revenues in the period such determination was made. Accounting for Income Taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected more likely than not to be realized in the future. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including the forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning strategies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We also account for any income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies.” We currently have provided for a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. We have considered the positive and negative evidences affecting the assessment of a full valuation allowance. Based on the available objective evidence, management does not believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realizable in the future. Should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future, a reversed adjustment to the valuation allowance would benefit net income in the period such determination is made. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The determination of income taxes also involves estimating the impact of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations and uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations. Accruals for tax contingencies require management to estimate the actual outcome of any such audits and the impact of uncertainties. Actual results could vary from these estimates. For example, in July 2005, we received a Notice of Proposed Assessment of Income Tax from the state of Hawaii asserting a tax deficiency, plus interest, totaling $613,000, which we refer to as the Hawaii tax assessment. The deficiency stems from certain refundable tax credits that the state of Hawaii subsequently disallowed in the examination of the Hawaii income tax returns for the tax years of 2000 and 2001 filed by Pihana Pacific, Inc., which we acquired on December 31, 2002. We strongly believe the disallowance of the refundable tax credits by the state of Hawaii is inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and that we have meritorious defenses to the claim. We intend to oppose the Hawaii tax assessment vigorously and will file a timely request with the Board of Review in the state of 33 Table of Contents Hawaii to appeal the Hawaii tax assessment. We do not believe it is probable that we will be required to pay the Hawaii tax assessment upon the completion of the appeals process. As a result, we have not accrued for any loss contingencies in connection with this Hawaii tax assessment as of December 31, 2005. Estimated and Contingent Liabilities. Management estimates exposure on certain liabilities and contingent liabilities, such as property taxes and litigation, based on the best information available at the time of determination. With respect to real and personal property taxes, management records what it can reasonably estimate based on prior payment history, current landlord estimates or estimates based on current or changing fixed asset values in each specific municipality, as applicable. However, there are circumstances beyond our control whereby the underlying value of the property or basis for which the tax is calculated on said property may change, such as a landlord selling the underlying property of one of our IBX center leases or a municipality changing the assessment value in a jurisdiction and, as a result, our property tax obligations may vary from period to period. Based upon the most current facts and circumstances, we make the necessary property tax accruals for each of our reporting periods. However, revisions in our estimates of the potential or actual liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position. For litigation claims, when management can reasonably estimate the range of loss and when an unfavorable outcome is probable, a contingent liability is recorded. For current legal proceedings, management believes that it has adequate legal defenses and that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, because an unfavorable outcome to current legal proceedings is not probable, management has determined that no accrual is needed. As additional information becomes available, we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position. Accounting for Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are stated at original cost or at relative fair value for acquired property and equipment, or in the case of IBX centers that we acquire, at fair value at the time of acquisition. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally two to five years for non-IBX equipment and two to thirteen years for IBX equipment. Leasehold improvements and assets acquired under capital lease are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset or improvement, unless they are considered integral equipment, in which case they are amortized over the lease term. Buildings owned by us are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the building, which is generally forty to fifty years. Pursuant to EITF Issue 05-6, “Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements Purchased after Lease Inception or Acquired in a Business Combination”, which we adopted in the second quarter of 2005 and which did not have a significant impact to us, (i) leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of acquisition and (ii) leasehold improvements that are placed into service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased. Should management determine that the actual useful lives of our property and equipment placed into service is less than originally anticipated, or if any of our property and equipment is deemed to have incurred an impairment, additional depreciation, or an impairment charge would be required, which would decrease net income in the period such determination was made. Conversely, should management determine that the actual useful lives of its property and equipment placed into service is greater than originally anticipated, less depreciation may be required, which would increase net income in the period such determination is made. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill. We account for the impairment of long-lived assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard, or SFAS, No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”, or in the case of goodwill, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, 34 Table of Contents “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” We evaluate the carrying value of our long-lived assets, consisting primarily of our IBX centers and goodwill, whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable or at least on an annual basis during the fourth quarter for goodwill. Such events or circumstances include, but are not limited to, a prolonged industry downturn, a significant decline in our market value or significant reductions in projected future cash flows. We currently operate in one reportable segment; however our goodwill is attributed solely to our Singapore reporting unit. Significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows, including profit margins, long-term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market, groupings of assets, discount rates and terminal growth rates. In addition, significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long-lived assets, including replacement cost, economic obsolescence, and the value that could be realized in orderly liquidation. Changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long-lived assets, thereby requiring us to write down the assets. Our net long-lived assets as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 included property and equipment of $438.8 million and $343.4 million, respectively, and goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets of $21.8 million and $22.3 million, respectively. Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. We account for asset retirement obligations in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard, or SFAS, No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” and Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.” Our asset retirement obligations are primarily related to our IBX Centers, of which the majority are leased under long-term arrangements, and, in certain cases, are required to be returned to the landlords in original condition. All of our IBX center leases have been subject to significant development by us in order to convert them from, in most cases, vacant buildings or warehouses into IBX centers. The majority of our IBX centers’ initial lease terms expire at various dates ranging from 2010 to 2020 and all of them have renewal options available to us. The actual cost of returning these IBX centers back to original condition to the landlords is unknown to us since we have not had to do this yet and do not anticipate doing this for quite some time. Therefore, in order to arrive at appropriate asset retirement obligations for our various IBX centers requires numerous estimates, including estimating how many lease renewal periods we expect to pursue for each of these IBX centers and the cost of removing and disposing of all of the property and equipment that we have placed into these IBX centers. Liabilities for these asset retirement obligations are initially recorded at their net present value and are included as a component of our property and equipment. In subsequent periods, accretion expense is recorded to accrete these liabilities to their future value over the remaining estimated period through the anticipated asset retirement date. Should management determine that the cost of returning these IBX centers to their original condition is less than originally anticipated, less accretion expense may be required, which would increase net income in the period such determination was made, which would also benefit future periods through the actual asset retirement date. Conversely, should management determine that the cost of returning these IBX centers to their original condition is greater than originally anticipated, more accretion expense may be required, which would decrease net income in the period such determination is made, which would also negatively impact future periods through the actual asset retirement date. Accounting for Leases and IBX acquisitions. We currently have fifteen operational IBX centers in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific and three that are not yet operational consisting of the recently-acquired Sunnyvale IBX, Chicago IBX and Los Angeles IBX, all of which are described above (see “Recent Developments”) and are scheduled to open for business during the first half of 2006. Our strategy, until recently, had been to enter into long-term leases for our IBX centers rather than to purchase and own these properties; however, commencing with our recent Los Angeles IBX acquisition and Ashburn campus property acquisition, we have altered this strategy by purchasing rather than leasing these properties. We may decide to purchase, rather than lease, other property in the future, as evidenced by our recent announcement on the Chicago metro area IBX expansion 35 Table of Contents project. The majority of our IBX centers are accounted for as operating leases; however, in April 2004, we entered into a long-term lease for a 95,000 square foot data center in the Washington, D.C. metro area, which we refer to as our new Washington, D.C. metro area IBX. This lease, which includes the leasing of all of the IBX plant and machinery equipment located in the building, is a capital lease. We account for leases in accordance with SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases.” Our analysis of this lease required significant judgment and estimates in order to assess the fair value of the leased property and determine our incremental borrowing rate given no implicit rate was defined within the lease to allow us to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payments. In addition, as this lease contained land, building and equipment elements, we had to separate the individual elements and analyze each element separately, as well as determine if the equipment was considered to be integral equipment to the building. Similarly, sometimes we will lease a building and at the same time buy the equipment located in the building, such as our recent Chicago IBX acquisition. In this case, we accounted for the Chicago IBX acquisition as a single accounting arrangement with multiple elements. As a result, we assessed the fair value of both the building and equipment elements and then assigned the relative fair value to each element. A full purchase transaction, such as our recent purchase of the Ashburn campus property, required a similar analysis since we acquired land, building and equipment elements and also had to assign the relative fair value to each element. While our first seven IBX centers were designed and built by us, in light of the availability of fully built-out data centers in select markets at costs significantly below those costs we would incur to build out new space, we have altered our business strategy to acquire partially or fully built-out data centers rather than build out our own data centers in order to meet our IBX expansion needs. However, in markets with high demand and where partially or fully built-out data centers are no longer available to acquire, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to build new IBX centers as evidenced by our recent announcements on the Washington, D.C. and Chicago metro area IBX expansion projects. Each individual IBX expansion transaction, either in the form of a long-term lease or the purchase of real property, is unique. For example, with respect to the Santa Clara IBX acquisition in December 2003, rather than enter into a long-term lease for both the building and IBX plant and equipment like the Washington, D.C. metro area IBX transaction mentioned above, we leased only the building in Santa Clara and purchased the IBX property and equipment located in the building. Yet, the building lease had payment terms which were at a premium to prevailing market rates for similar properties at the time of signing the lease. As a result, we recorded an unfavorable lease liability, which is being amortized into rent expense over the term of the lease. Also, given that the Santa Clara IBX was an operating data center, unlike the vacant Washington, D.C. metro area IBX, we were required to negotiate with various customers located in the IBX and enter into new contracts with these customers. In addition, we hired a number of the employees that were already working in this IBX. As a result, we recorded several intangible assets. In summary, each individual IBX center expansion will require a significant amount of judgment and management estimates in order to properly address the accounting treatment. Accounting for Restructuring Charges. We have recorded restructuring charges in four of the past five years as we modified our business strategy in light of changing economic circumstances. Most recently, in October 2005, in light of the availability of fully or partially built-out data centers in the Silicon Valley, including the possibility of expansion in some of the four IBX centers we currently operate in the Silicon Valley, we made the decision to exit the approximately 40 acre San Jose ground lease because opportunities for future expansion were no longer economical. In conjunction with this decision, we entered into an agreement with the landlord of this property for an early termination of the San Jose ground lease whereby we will pay $40.0 million over the next four years, commencing January 1, 2006, to terminate this lease, which would otherwise require significantly higher cumulative lease payments through 2020. As a result of the San Jose ground lease termination, we recorded a $33.8 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2005, which represents the present value of our estimated future cash payments to exit this property, as well as the write-off of all remaining property and equipment attributed to the development of this property. 36 Table of Contents We account for such activities in accordance with SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” Under the provisions of SFAS No. 146, we had to estimate the future cash payments required to exit certain leases for which we have taken restructuring charges for during 2004 and 2005, net of any estimated sub-rental income and expense, through the remainder of these lease terms and then determine the present value of such future cash flows to record the appropriate restructuring charges. In future periods, we will record accretion expense to accrete our accrued restructuring liabilities up to an amount equal to the total estimated future cash payments necessary to complete the exit of certain leases. These restructuring activities required a significant amount of judgment and management estimates in order to determine a reasonable scenario of future net cash flows required to exit certain leases. Should the actual lease exit costs differ from our estimates, we may be required to adjust our restructuring charges associated with certain of these leases, which would impact net income in the period such determination was made. In addition, in the future, circumstances may change which would require us to record additional restructuring charges, which would require similar levels of judgment and management estimates in order to determine the appropriate restructuring charge to record. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. We accounted for stock-based compensation plans in accordance with SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” through December 31, 2005. As permitted under SFAS No. 123, we used the intrinsic value-based method of Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” to account for our employee stock-based compensation plans through December 31, 2005. Under APB Opinion No. 25, compensation expense was based on the difference, if any, on the date of grant, between the fair value of our shares and the exercise price of the option. Unearned deferred compensation resulting from employee option grants was amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the individual options, in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 28, “Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans.” We have also adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure—An Amendment of SFAS No. 123.” Primarily as a result of employee stock options being granted at exercise prices below fair market value prior to our initial public offering (IPO) in August 2000, we recorded a deferred stock-based compensation charge on our balance sheet of $54.5 million in 2000, which was amortized over the four-year vesting life of these individual stock options net of the reversal of any previously recorded accelerated stock-based compensation expense due to the forfeitures of those stock options prior to vesting. The amortization of the deferred stock-based compensation related to these pre-IPO stock options ended in August 2004. However, we also recognize stock-based compensation in connection with employee stock option grants modified subsequent to issuance, primarily in connection with termination of employment as was the case with stock options that we modified in November 2005 in connection with an employee separation agreement with one of our executive officers, which resulted in an additional $1.4 million of stock-based compensation expense for us during the quarter ended December 31, 2005. In addition, in February 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the issuance of 320,500 restricted shares of common stock to executive officers. These restricted shares are subject to four-year vesting, and will only vest if the stock appreciates to certain pre-determined levels. These restricted shares are a compensatory plan under the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and are accounted for as variable awards. As a result, compensation cost will be adjusted for changes in the market price of our common stock until the restricted shares become vested. On the date of grant of the restricted shares in February 2005, we recorded a $14.4 million deferred stock-based compensation charge. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a reduction in deferred stock-based compensation of $3.3 million as a result of a declining stock price and forfeitures and recorded $6.5 million of stock-based compensation expense related to these restricted shares for the year ended December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, there was a total of $4.6 million of deferred stock-based compensation remaining to be amortized related to these restricted shares. We expect stock-based compensation expense related to these restricted shares to impact our results of operations through 2008. As of December 31, 2005, deferred stock-based compensation on our balance sheet, which was primarily related to restricted shares, totaled $4.9 million, and for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of 37 Table of Contents $8.3 million, $1.5 million and $2.9 million, respectively. Had we recognized stock-based compensation under the fair value provisions of SFAS No. 123, we would have recognized stock-based compensation expense of $32.7 million, $20.8 million and $10.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with assumptions appropriate to these periods. For further detailed information on how we calculated these pro forma stock-based compensation charges, see Note 1 of our “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No. 123(R) revises SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock-based compensation, such as employee stock purchase plans and restricted stock awards. In addition, SFAS No. 123(R) supercedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and amends SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.” Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), stock-based compensation awards must meet certain criteria in order for the award to qualify for equity classification. An award that does not meet those criteria will be classified as a liability and be re-measured each period. SFAS No. 123(R) retains the requirements on accounting for the income tax effects of stock-based compensation contained in SFAS No. 123; however, it changes how excess tax benefits will be presented in the statement of cash flows from operating to financing activities. In addition, in March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB No. 107”), which offers guidance on SFAS No. 123(R). SAB No. 107 was issued to assist preparers by simplifying some of the implementation challenges of SFAS No. 123(R) while enhancing the information that investors receive. Key topics of SAB No. 107 include discussion on the valuation models available to preparers and guidance on key assumptions used in these valuation models, such as expected volatility and expected term, as well as guidance on accounting for the income tax effects of SFAS No. 123(R) and disclosure considerations, among other topics. SFAS No. 123(R) and SAB No. 107 were effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005; however in April 2005, the SEC approved a new rule that SFAS No. 123(R) and SAB No. 107 are now effective for public companies for annual, rather than interim, periods beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, the first quarter of 2006 will be the first period in which we will report stock-based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) and SAB No. 107. We are currently considering the financial accounting, income tax and internal control implications of SFAS No. 123(R), including related FASB Staff Positions issued during 2005 and 2006, and SAB No. 107 (collectively, the “new accounting guidance for stock-based compensation”). The new accounting guidance for stock-based compensation provides for several transition methods available for companies to choose: • Modified prospective application; • Modified retrospective application; • Modified retrospective application to all prior periods; and • Modified retrospective application to only interim prior periods of the year of adoption. We have selected the modified prospective application method, which means that we will not restate any prior financial statements and only apply the new accounting guidance for stock-based compensation on a prospective basis, commencing with the first quarter of 2006, which will include all unvested and outstanding equity awards as of January 1, 2006 in addition to new equity awards that we will issue commencing in 2006 and beyond. We generally grant or administer three types of equity awards or plans: (i) stock options, which are generally subject to a four-year vest period, (ii) restricted stock with both a service and market price condition and (iii) an employee stock purchase plan. Although we will continue to monitor equity award behavior within our industry, and modify our compensation structure accordingly and as appropriate, we do not anticipate any immediate changes in the types of equity awards or the characteristics of the equity awards that we have granted in the past for at least the foreseeable future other than our intention to reduce the quantity of equity awards we grant in the future in order to manage the effects of both the dilution to our equity base as well as the size of our stock-based compensation charge; however, one change that we elected to make in regards to stock options was to reduce the contractual life of all new option grants, commencing with grants in the fourth quarter of 2005, from ten years to seven years. 38 Table of Contents The new accounting guidance for stock-based compensation allows companies a variety of choices in selecting an appropriate option-pricing model to estimate fair value. After analyzing and assessing various options, we have selected the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate fair value for both stock options and our employee stock purchase plan and have selected a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate fair value for new restricted stock awards that contain both a service and market price condition as the most appropriate valuation methods for us at this time. In order to arrive at an estimate of fair value for equity awards, these option-pricing models require numerous assumptions to be made, such as the expected volatility of our stock and the expected life of the individual equity awards. In addition, the new accounting guidance for stock-based compensation requires that we apply an appropriate forfeiture rate to the stock-based compensation charge that we would otherwise incur to account for those equity awards that will not vest as a result of expected employee turnover or forfeitures. As a result, volatility, expected life and forfeiture rate represent significant assumptions that will have a significant impact on the stock-based compensation that we will record. We are currently analyzing historical trends for each of these key assumptions in order to arrive at the most appropriate estimates. Regarding estimated life, we currently expect to use the simplified method described in SAB No. 107 due to our limited history. Furthermore, while we had previously selected to amortize stock-based compensation on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of individual equity awards in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 28, “Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans”, as permitted under a one-time election to change the method of amortization at the time of adoption of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, we have decided to switch to the straight-line method of amortizing stock-based compensation over the vesting period of individual equity awards commencing with equity awards granted during the first quarter of 2006. The adoption of the new accounting guidance for stock-based compensation is expected to have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. Although the actual amount of stock-based compensation expense we will recognize starting in 2006 is difficult to estimate since it involves estimating numerous assumptions, such as the number and type of stock-based awards granted in the future, estimating our future stock price for those awards that will be granted in the future and the related assumptions used for estimating the fair values of these equity awards, such as volatility, expected life and expected forfeitures, we currently estimate that our total annual stock-based compensation for 2006 will be significant and will likely not be less than the $32.7 million that we would have recorded in 2005 had we recognized stock-based compensation under the fair value provisions of SFAS No. 123 as discussed above. Stock-based compensation will be reflected in our statement of operations in cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses. In addition, the new accounting guidance for stock-based compensation is expected to have significant ramifications to our income taxes in future periods. Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 were split between the following revenue classifications (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2005 % 2004 % Recurring revenues $ 208,003 94 % $ 154,449 94 % Non-recurring revenues: Installation and professional services 12,193 5 % 8,333 5 % Other 861 1 % 889 1 % 13,054 6 % 9,222 6 % Total revenues $ 221,057 100 % $ 163,671 100 % 39 Table of Contents Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 were geographically comprised of the following (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2005 % 2004 % U.S. revenues $ 191,390 87 % $ 141,598 87 % Asia-Pacific revenues 29,667 13 % 22,073 13 % Total revenues $ 221,057 100 % $ 163,671 100 % We recognized revenues of $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to revenues of $163.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a 35% increase. We analyze our business geographically between the U.S. and Asia-Pacific as further discussed below. Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation, interconnection and managed infrastructure services. We consider these services recurring as our customers are billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues are a significant component of our total revenues comprising greater than 90% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Historically, approximately half of our then existing customers order new services in any given quarter representing greater than half of the new orders received in each quarter. To review our revenue recognition policies for our recurring revenue streams, refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” above. Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer’s initial deployment and professional services that we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring as they are billed typically once and only upon completion of the installation or professional services work performed. These non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer. As a percent of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future. Other non-recurring revenues are comprised primarily of customer settlements, which represent fees paid to us by customers who wish to terminate their contracts with us prior to their expiration. To review our revenue recognition policies for our non-recurring revenue streams, refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” above. In addition to reviewing recurring versus non-recurring revenues, we look at two other primary metrics when we analyze our revenues: 1) customer count and 2) utilization. Our customer count increased to 1,138 as of December 31, 2005 versus 950 as of December 31, 2004, an increase of 20%. Our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus total cabinet space available. Our utilization rate grew to 54% as of December 31, 2005 from 45% as of December 31, 2004; however, excluding the impact of our most recent expansions in the Washington, D.C. and Silicon Valley area markets, our utilization rate would have been 58% as of December 31, 2005. Although we have substantial capacity for growth, our utilization rates vary from market to market among our IBX centers in the eleven markets across the U.S. and Asia-Pacific. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for some customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of draw our customers take from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain of our high power demand customers. We could face power limitations in our centers even though we may have additional physical capacity available within a specific IBX center. This could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows. As a result of these power limitations in our existing IBX centers, the maximum utilization rate that we expect to achieve for most IBX centers until we consider an IBX center full or sold-out is approximately 75-80% depending on the building configurations. Therefore, consistent with our recent 40 Table of Contents expansions in the Washington, D.C., Silicon Valley, Chicago and Los Angeles metro area markets, we will continue to closely manage available space and power capacity in each of our operating markets and expect to continue to make strategic and selective expansions to our global footprint when and where appropriate. U.S. Revenues. We recognized U.S. revenues of $191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $141.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. U.S. revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $180.4 million and $134.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, a 34% increase. U.S. recurring revenues consist primarily of colocation and interconnection services plus a nominal amount of managed infrastructure services and, commencing in the fourth quarter of 2005, in connection with our October 2005 purchase of the Ashburn campus property, a nominal amount of recurring rental income from the other tenants located on this property that we now own, which totaled $312,000. U.S. recurring revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 included $9.8 million of revenue generated from the recently acquired Washington, D.C. area and Silicon Valley area IBX centers, which opened for business in the fourth quarter of 2004 and first quarter of 2005, respectively. Excluding revenues from these recently acquired U.S. IBX centers, the period over period growth in recurring revenues was primarily the result of an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers acquired during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and weighted-average utilization rate as discussed above, and selective price increases in each of our IBX markets. We expect our U.S. recurring revenues, particularly colocation and interconnection services, to continue to remain our most significant source of revenue for the foreseeable future. In addition, U.S. revenues consisted of non-recurring revenues of $11.0 million and $7.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Non-recurring revenues are primarily related to the recognized portion of deferred installation, professional services and settlement fees associated with certain contract terminations. Included in U.S. non-recurring revenues are settlement fees of $817,000 and $609,000, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Offsetting some of this non-recurring revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 were service level credits that we recorded totaling $457,000 that were issued or will be issued to certain of our customers related to two separate power outages in our Chicago and Washington, D.C. metro area IBX centers. There were no significant service level credits recorded in the year ended December 31, 2004. Excluding settlements and service level credits, U.S. non-recurring revenues, consisting of the recognized portion of deferred installation and professional services, increased 58% period over period, primarily due to strong existing and new customer growth during the year, as well as the completion of certain custom projects for the U.S. government during the quarter ended March 31, 2005. Asia-Pacific Revenues. We recognized Asia-Pacific revenues of $29.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a 34% increase. Asia-Pacific revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $27.6 million and $20.2 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, consisting primarily of colocation and managed infrastructure services. In addition, Asia-Pacific revenues consisted of non-recurring revenues of $2.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Asia-Pacific non-recurring revenues included $44,000 and $280,000, respectively, of contract settlement revenue for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Asia-Pacific revenues are generated from Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo, with Singapore representing approximately 45% and 52%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Our Asia-Pacific colocation revenues are similar to the revenues that we generate from our U.S. IBX centers; however, our Singapore IBX center has additional managed infrastructure service revenue, such as mail service and managed platform solutions, which we do not currently offer in any other IBX center location. The growth in our Asia-Pacific revenues is primarily the result of an increase in the customer base in this region during the past year, particularly in Hong Kong, Sydney and Tokyo. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues were $158.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $136.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a 16% increase. The largest cost components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX centers, utility costs including electricity and bandwidth, IBX employees’ salaries and benefits, supplies and equipment and security services. A 41 Table of Contents substantial majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period. However, there are certain costs, which are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies, that are directly related to growth of services in our existing and new customer base. We expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will increase in the future on a per unit or fixed basis in addition to on a customer growth or variable basis. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months as compared to other times of the year. U.S. Cost of Revenues. U.S. cost of revenues were $138.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $118.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. U.S. cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 included (i) $57.1 million of depreciation expense and (ii) $1.9 million of accretion expense comprised of $504,000 for our asset retirement obligations and $1.4 million for our restructuring charges for certain leasehold interests recorded in 2004 and 2005 as we accrete the related liabilities to the total estimated future cash payments needed. U.S. cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 included (i) $50.1 million of depreciation expense, (ii) $35,000 of stock-based compensation expense, (iii) $355,000 of accretion expense associated with our asset retirement obligation for our various leasehold interests and (iv) $147,000 of amortization expense associated with the intangible asset acquired with our Santa Clara IBX center that became fully amortized in December 2004. Our U.S. cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 also included $6.4 million of additional operating costs not incurred in the prior year associated with the recently acquired Washington, D.C. and Silicon Valley metro area IBX centers, which opened for business in the fourth quarter of 2004 and first quarter of 2005, respectively plus $1.5 million of costs attributed to our three most recently acquired IBX centers in Sunnyvale, Chicago and Los Angeles which will be available to customers in 2006. Excluding depreciation, stock-based compensation, accretion expense, amortization expense and the costs associated with operating our new IBX centers, U.S. cost of revenues increased period over period to $71.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $67.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a 5% increase. This increase is primarily the result of increasing utility costs in line with increasing customer installations and revenues attributed to customer growth partially offset by savings of approximately $1.8 million in operating costs, primarily rent, in connection with a property we recorded a restructuring charge for in Los Angeles in December 2004. We continue to anticipate that our cost of revenues, excluding stock-based compensation, will increase in the foreseeable future to the extent that the occupancy levels in our U.S. IBX centers increase and as the costs attributed to newly-acquired IBX centers in the Silicon Valley, Chicago and Los Angeles metro areas commence operations more fully in 2006. However, a portion of our expected increase in U.S. cost of revenues will be partially offset by a reduction in rent expense as a result of our October 2005 purchase of the Ashburn campus property where our primary Washington, D.C. metro area IBX center is located. We expect that this savings in rent expense will be approximately $530,000 per quarter. However, part of the rent savings will be offset by increased depreciation of approximately $245,000 per quarter on the purchased property. In addition, any increase in U.S. cost of revenues will be offset in part from the San Jose ground lease termination. We expect that this savings in operating costs, primarily rent and property tax expense, to be approximately $1.4 million per quarter, with partial savings of approximately $940,000 realized in the fourth quarter of 2005, although this decrease in rent and property tax expense will be somewhat reduced by an increase in accretion expense associated with this restructuring charge, which is expected to be approximately $2.3 million for 2006. Furthermore, as a result of the mandatory expensing of stock-based compensation commencing in the first quarter of 2006, which is the first quarter in which we will reflect the new accounting rules for equity-based compensation, our U.S. cost of revenues will increase further. We expect that this stock-based compensation expense will be significant. For further information, refer to our discussion on “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues were $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 included $3.6 million of depreciation expense and $259,000 of non-cash rent expense associated with the value attributed to warrants issued in May 2004 to our landlord in connection with a lease amendment for our Hong Kong IBX center. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 included $3.7 million of depreciation expense and $194,000 of non-cash rent expense. 42 Table of Contents Excluding depreciation and non-cash rent expense, Asia-Pacific cost of revenues increased period over period to $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a 10% increase. This increase is primarily the result of increasing utility and bandwidth costs in line with increasing customer installations and revenues attributed to this customer growth. Our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues are generated in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. There are several managed infrastructure service revenue streams unique to our Singapore IBX center, such as mail service and managed platform solutions, that are more labor intensive than our service offerings in the United States. We anticipate that our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues, excluding stock-based compensation, will experience moderate growth in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, as a result of the mandatory expensing of stock-based compensation commencing in the first quarter of 2006, which is the first quarter in which we will reflect the new accounting rules for equity-based compensation, our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues will increase further. We expect that this stock-based compensation expense will be significant. For further information, refer to our discussion on “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. U.S. Sales and Marketing Expenses. U.S. sales and marketing expenses increased to $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Included in U.S. sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $1.6 million of stock-based compensation expense and $60,000 of amortization expense associated with an intangible asset in connection with our Santa Clara IBX center. Included in U.S. sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $60,000 of stock-based compensation expense and $59,000 of amortization expense associated with an intangible asset in connection with our Santa Clara IBX center. The increase in the stock-based compensation expense period over period is a result of the non-cash charge attributed to restricted stock awards granted to our sales and marketing executive officers in the first quarter of 2005. Excluding stock-based compensation and amortization expense, U.S. sales and marketing expenses increased to $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a 16% increase. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel. This increase was primarily due to approximately $1.9 million of higher compensation costs, including increases in sales compensation related to strong new customer bookings throughout 2005, general salary increases and bonuses for our marketing staff and non-commissioned sales staff, as well as some moderate headcount growth (68 U.S. sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2005 versus 65 as of December 31, 2004); however, this growth was partially offset by additional recoveries of bad debt expense over the prior year of approximately $190,000 due to a strong and successful collections effort on aged receivables previously written-off. Going forward, we expect to see U.S. sales and marketing spending, excluding stock-based compensation, to increase nominally in absolute dollars as we continue to grow our business. Furthermore, as a result of the mandatory expensing of stock-based compensation commencing in the first quarter of 2006, which is the first quarter in which we will reflect the new accounting rules for equity-based compensation, our U.S. sales and marketing expenses will increase further. We expect that this stock-based compensation expense will be significant. For further information, refer to our discussion on “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses decreased to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Included in Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $1.8 million of amortization expense associated with several intangible assets associated with our Singapore operations, which were fully amortized in December 2004. Excluding amortization expense, Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses were $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 versus $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a nominal 3% increase. While there was an increase of approximately $138,000 in higher compensation costs during this period, including increases in sales compensation related to strong new customer bookings throughout 2005, particularly in Hong Kong, Sydney and Tokyo, general salary increases and 43 Table of Contents bonuses for our marketing staff and non-commissioned sales staff, as well as some moderate headcount growth (27 Asia-Pacific sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2005 versus 26 as of December 31, 2004), and an increase in related travel and entertainment costs of approximately $132,000, this growth was mostly offset by additional recoveries of bad debt expense over the prior year of approximately $224,000 due to a strong and successful collections effort on aged receivables previously written-off. Our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses consist of the same type of costs that we incur in our U.S. operations, namely compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel. Our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses are generated in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. We expect that our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, will experience some moderate growth in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, as a result of the mandatory expensing of stock-based compensation commencing in the first quarter of 2006, which is the first quarter in which we will reflect the new accounting rules for equity-based compensation, our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses will increase further. We expect that this stock-based compensation expense will be significant. For further information, refer to our discussion on “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased to $45.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. U.S. General and Administrative Expenses. U.S. general and administrative expenses increased to $37.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Included in U.S. general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $6.7 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1.7 million of depreciation expense. Included in U.S. general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $1.4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1.8 million of depreciation expense. The increase in the stock-based compensation expense period over period is primarily a result of the non-cash charge attributed to restricted stock awards granted to our executive officers in the first quarter of 2005, net of forfeitures for two of these executive officers that have left or will terminate their employment with us during the first quarter of 2006. Excluding stock-based compensation expense and depreciation expense, U.S. general and administrative expenses increased to $28.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $22.7 million for the prior period, a 27% increase. This increase is primarily due to approximately $5.2 million of higher compensation costs, including general salary increases, bonuses, headcount growth (152 U.S. general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2005 versus 126 as of December 31, 2004) and $986,000 related to accrued severance charges related to two of our officers that have left or will terminate their employment with us during the first quarter of 2006, as well as an increase in professional fees, primarily approximately $175,000 of costs associated with the STT divestiture transaction completed in November 2005. General and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation, consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, accounting, legal and other professional service fees and other general corporate expenses such as our corporate headquarter office lease. Going forward, we expect U.S. general and administrative spending, excluding stock-based compensation, to increase moderately in absolute dollars as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth. Furthermore, as a result of the mandatory expensing of stock-based compensation commencing in the first quarter of 2006, which is the first quarter in which we will reflect the new accounting rules for equity-based compensation, our U.S. general and administrative expenses will increase further. We expect that this stock-based compensation expense will be significant. For further information, refer to our discussion on “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above. Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses increased to $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Included in Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses were $284,000 and $366,000, respectively, of depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Excluding depreciation, Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses increased to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $6.2 million for the prior period, a 21% increase. This increase is primarily due to 44 Table of Contents approximately $1.2 million of higher compensation costs, including general salary increases and bonuses, as well as some headcount growth (85 Asia-Pacific general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2005 versus 72 as of December 31, 2004). Our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses consist of the same type of costs that we incur in our U.S. operations, namely salaries and related expenses, accounting, legal and other professional service fees and other general corporate expenses. Our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses are generated in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. Our Asia-Pacific headquarter office is located in Singapore. Most of the corporate overhead support functions that we have in the U.S., such as finance, legal, marketing and information technology, also reside in our Singapore office in order to support our Asia-Pacific operations; however, each of our Asia-Pacific locations in Hong Kong, Sydney and Tokyo also have general and administrative staff dedicated to each specific operation. In addition to our Asia-Pacific headquarter office in Singapore, we also have separate office locations in Tokyo and Hong Kong (the Sydney general and administrative staff work out of the Sydney IBX). We expect that our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, will experience some moderate growth in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, as a result of the mandatory expensing of stock-based compensation commencing in the first quarter of 2006, which is the first quarter in which we will reflect the new accounting rules for equity-based compensation, our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses will increase further. We expect that this stock-based compensation expense will be significant. For further information, refer to our discussion on “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above. Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a restructuring charge of $33.8 million, which we refer to as the 2005 restructuring charge. In light of the availability of fully or partially built-out data centers in the Silicon Valley, including the possibility of expansion in or near some of the four IBX centers we currently have in the Silicon Valley, we made the decision that retaining the approximately 40 acre San Jose ground lease for future expansion was no longer economical. In conjunction with this decision, we entered into an agreement with the landlord of this property for an early termination of the San Jose ground lease whereby we will pay $40.0 million over the next four years, commencing January 1, 2006, to terminate this lease, which would otherwise require significantly higher cumulative lease payments through 2020. The restructuring charge consisted of (i) a $32.3 million charge representing the present value of our estimated future cash payments to exit this property, which is net of $4.4 million of deferred rent previously accrued for this lease (thereby creating a total restructuring liability of $36.7 million associated with this lease) and (ii) a write-off of property and equipment of $1.5 million representing development costs incurred to date to prepare this land for use. We expect, as a result of this restructuring charge, we will realize annual savings in cost of revenues of approximately $5.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded restructuring charges of $17.7 million, which we refer to as the 2004 restructuring charge. In light of the availability of fully built-out data centers in select markets at costs significantly below those costs we would incur in building out new space, we made the decision in December 2004 to exit leases for excess space adjacent to one of our New York metro area IBXs, as well as space on the floor above our original Los Angeles IBX. The restructuring charges consisted of (i) a $13.9 million charge representing the present value of our estimated future cash payments, net of any estimated subrental income and expense, through the remainder of these lease terms; and (ii) a write-off of property and equipment of $3.8 million, representing the write-off of all remaining property and equipment attributed to the excess space on the floor above our Los Angeles IBX. We entered into a two-year sublease agreement for the excess space in the New York metro area and are currently evaluating opportunities related to our excess space in Los Angeles and the current restructuring charge for these properties is based on the best available information. As a result of these restructuring charges, primarily relating to the Los Angeles property, we realized annual savings in cost of revenues of approximately $1.8 million during 2005. As of December 31, 2004, we had total accrued restructuring charges of $14.8 million recorded as a liability on our balance sheet related to the 2004 restructuring charge described above. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we (i) recorded the $36.7 million of new restructuring charge liability for the 2005 restructuring charge described above; (ii) recorded $1.4 million of accretion expense related to these excess leases and (iii) incurred net 45 Table of Contents cash payments of $3.1 million related to these excess leases resulting in an accrued restructuring charge liability on our balance sheet of $49.8 million as of December 31, 2005. We are contractually committed to these excess leases through 2015. For further detailed information on our restructuring charges, see Note 17 of our “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Interest Income. Interest income increased to $3.6 million from $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest income increased due to higher average cash, cash equivalent and short-term and long-term investment balances held in interest-bearing accounts during these periods, as well as higher yields on those balances due to increased interest rates. The average annualized yield for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 3.32% versus 1.64% for the year ended December 31, 2004. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $8.9 million from $11.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the quarter ended March 31, 2005, we converted 95% of the outstanding 14% convertible secured notes and unpaid interest totaling $38.0 million held by STT Communications into 4.1 million shares of our preferred stock, which was subsequently converted into 4.1 million shares of our common stock in February 2005. In addition, STT Communications converted the remaining 5% of the outstanding 14% convertible secured notes and unpaid interest totaling $2.2 million into 240,578 shares of our preferred stock, which was immediately converted into 240,578 shares of our common stock in November 2005. These conversion activities resulted in a decrease in interest expense in 2005, offset in part, by interest expense associated with (i) the $35.3 million capital lease obligation we recorded in connection with the Washington, D.C. metro area IBX center during the fourth quarter of 2004, which bears interest at 8.50%; (ii) the $18.7 million financing we recorded in connection with the Silicon Valley metro area IBX center equipment and fiber during the first quarter of 2005, which bears interest at 8.50%; (iii) the $9.7 million financing for equipment we purchased in connection with our Chicago IBX acquisition in November 2005, which bears interest at 7.50%; (iv) the $38.1 million financing we recorded in connection with our Los Angeles IBX financing in December 2005, which bears interest at 7.75%; (v) the $60.0 million mortgage payable we recorded in connection with our Ashburn campus financing in December 2005, which bears interest at 8.00% and (vi) the $30.0 million drawdown from our $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line during October 2005, which bore interest at an initial rate of 5.72% and was fully repaid in January 2006. As a result of these new financing arrangements, we expect interest expense to increase in 2006. Loss on Debt Extinguishment and Conversion. In February 2004, with the proceeds from the convertible debenture offering, we paid off the remaining $34.3 million credit facility and two other smaller debt facilities with a combined total of $2.9 million of principal remaining, as well as redeemed the remaining $30.5 million 13% senior notes that were outstanding at a premium of 106.5% through March 2004. In addition, in March 2004, the 10% $10.0 million convertible secured notes issued in connection with the Crosslink financing, and which had a beneficial conversion feature, were converted to 2.5 million shares of our common stock. As a result of these various repayments, redemption and conversion of our older debt facilities, we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment and conversion of $16.2 million, comprised primarily of the write-off of the various debt issuance costs and discounts associated with these various debt facilities totaling $13.7 million, as well as the premium paid to the holders of our 13% senior notes required to redeem these early and other cash transaction costs totaling $2.5 million. There was no loss recorded in connection with the STT convertible secured notes conversion activity during the year ended December 31, 2005 as the STT convertible secured notes did not have a beneficial conversion feature at the time of issuance on December 31, 2002. Income Taxes. A full valuation allowance is recorded against our net deferred tax assets as management cannot conclude, based on available objective evidence including recurring historical losses, that it is more likely than not that the net value of our deferred tax assets will be realized. However, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded $543,000 and $153,000, respectively, of income tax expense, primarily representing income taxes related to alternative minimum tax and foreign jurisdictions. We have not incurred any significant income tax expense since inception and we do not expect to incur any significant income tax expense during 2006 other than alternative minimum tax. 46 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were split between the following revenue classifications (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2004 % 2003 % Recurring revenues $ 154,449 94 % $ 109,989 93 % Non-recurring revenues: Installation and professional services 8,333 5 % 6,189 5 % Other 889 1 % 1,764 2 % 9,222 6 % 7,953 7 % Total revenues $ 163,671 100 % $ 117,942 100 % Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were geographically comprised of the following (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2004 % 2003 % U.S. revenues $ 141,598 87 % $ 99,669 85 % Asia-Pacific revenues 22,073 13 % 18,273 15 % Total revenues $ 163,671 100 % $ 117,942 100 % We recognized revenues of $163.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to revenues of $117.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, a 39% increase. We analyze our business geographically between the U.S. and Asia-Pacific as further discussed below. Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation, interconnection and managed infrastructure services. We consider these services recurring as once a customer has been installed in one of our IBX centers they are billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues are a significant component of our total revenues comprising 94% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to 93% in the prior year. Historically, greater than half of our customers order new services each quarter and greater than half of our new orders come from our already installed customer base each quarter. Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer’s initial deployment and professional services that we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring as they are billed typically once and only upon completion of the installation or professional services work performed. The non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer. Installation and professional services revenues increased 34% period over period, primarily due to strong existing and new customer growth during the year. As a percent of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent approximately 5% of total revenues in each period. Other non-recurring revenues are comprised primarily of customer settlements, which represent fees paid to us by customers who wish to terminate their contracts with us prior to the expiration of their contract. In addition to reviewing recurring versus non-recurring revenues, we look at two other primary metrics when we analyze our revenues: 1) customer count and 2) utilization. Our customer count increased to 950 as of December 31, 2004 versus 712 as of December 31, 2003, an increase of 33%. Our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus total cabinet space available. Our utilization rate grew to 45% as of December 31, 2004 from 35% as of December 31, 2003. Although we have substantial capacity for growth, our 47 Table of Contents utilization rates vary from market to market among our 15 worldwide IBX centers. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. Therefore, consistent with our lease of Sprint’s Santa Clara property in December 2003 and our expansion into the Washington, D.C. metro area market in April 2004 and further expansion into the Silicon Valley market in December 2004, we continually review available space in our other operating markets. U.S. Revenues. We recognized U.S. revenues of $141.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $99.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. U.S. revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $134.3 million and $93.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, a 43% increase. U.S. recurring revenues consist primarily of colocation and interconnection services plus a nominal amount of managed infrastructure services. U.S. recurring revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 included revenue generated from the recently acquired Santa Clara IBX center. Excluding revenue from this acquired U.S. IBX hub, the period over period growth in recurring revenues was primarily the result of an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customer growth acquired during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and weighted-average utilization rate as discussed above. As noted above, historically, greater than half of our new orders come from our already installed customer base each period. In addition, U.S. revenues consisted of non-recurring revenues of $7.3 million and $6.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Non-recurring revenues are primarily related to the recognized portion of deferred installation and professional services. Also included in U.S. non-recurring revenues are settlement fees of $609,000 and $1.2 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 associated with certain contract terminations. The $609,000 in settlement fees for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily represented a bankruptcy court-mandated payment from Excite@Home. The $1.2 million in settlement fees for the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily represented bankruptcy court-mandated payments from both Worldcom and Excite@Home. Asia-Pacific Revenues. We recognized Asia-Pacific revenues of $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Asia-Pacific revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $20.2 million and $16.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, consisting primarily of colocation and managed infrastructure services. In addition, Asia-Pacific revenues consisted of non-recurring revenues of $1.9 million for both years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Asia-Pacific non-recurring revenues included $280,000 and $584,000, respectively, of contract settlement revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Asia-Pacific revenues are generated from Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo with Singapore representing approximately 52% and 77%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Our Asia-Pacific colocation revenues are similar to the revenues that we generate from our U.S. IBX centers; however, our Singapore IBX center has additional managed infrastructure service revenue, such as mail service and managed platform solutions, which we do not currently offer in any other IBX center location. The growth in our Asia-Pacific revenues is primarily the result of an increase in the customer base in this region during the past year, particularly in Tokyo and Sydney; however, this revenue growth was partially offset by a decrease in low-margin bandwidth revenue in Singapore of approximately $3.1 million. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues were $136.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $128.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, a 7% increase. The largest cost components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX centers, utility costs including electricity and bandwidth, IBX employees’ salaries and benefits, supplies and equipment and security services. A substantial majority of our cost of revenues are fixed in nature and do not vary significantly from period to period. However, there are certain costs, which are considered variable in nature, including utilities and supplies, that are directly related to growth of services for our existing and new customer base. Given a large component of our cost of revenues are fixed in nature, we anticipate any growth in revenues will have a significant 48 Table of Contents incremental flow-through to gross profit; however, power and cooling requirements are growing on a per server basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. This, combined with the fact that we do not currently control the amount of draw our customers take from installed circuits, means that our utility costs are expected to increase in the future, and we may not be successful in raising power revenues to a sufficient level to offset such expected increases in utility costs. U.S. Cost of Revenues. U.S. cost of revenues were $118.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $107.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. U.S. cost of revenues included $50.1 million of depreciation expense, $35,000 of stock-based compensation expense, $355,000 of accretion expense associated with our asset retirement obligations relating to our various leaseholds and $147,000 of amortization expense associated with an intangible asset related to our Santa Clara IBX center for the year ended December 31, 2004. U.S. cost of revenues included $49.9 million of depreciation expense, $59,000 of stock-based compensation expense, $562,000 of accretion expense associated with our asset retirement obligations relating to our various leaseholds and $13,000 of amortization expense associated with an intangible asset related to our Santa Clara IBX center for the year ended December 31, 2003. Excluding depreciation, stock-based compensation, accretion expense and amortization expense, U.S. cost of revenues increased period over period to $67.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $56.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, a 19% increase. This increase is primarily the result of the operating costs associated with the Santa Clara IBX center acquired on December 1, 2003, as well as increasing utility costs in our IBX centers, excluding the newly-acquired Santa Clara IBX, of $4.1 million in line with increasing customer installations and revenues attributed to this customer growth and $1.2 million of higher compensation costs in our IBX centers, excluding the newly-acquired Santa Clara IBX, including general salary increases and bonuses for our IBX staff. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues were $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues included $3.7 million of depreciation expense and $194,000 of non-cash rent expense associated with the value attributed to warrants issued to our landlord in connection with a lease amendment for our Hong Kong IBX center for the year ended December 31, 2004. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues included $4.4 million of depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2003. Excluding depreciation and non-cash rent expense, Asia-Pacific cost of revenues decreased period over period to $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, a 9% decrease. This decrease is primarily the result of (i) a decrease in bandwidth costs in Singapore associated with a corresponding decrease in low-margin bandwidth revenue in this location of approximately $2.4 million; (ii) a decrease in operating costs in Singapore as a result of the asset sale of one of our two IBX centers in Singapore that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2003 of $804,000 and (iii) the renegotiation and reduction of our Hong Kong and Tokyo lease costs, resulting in rent savings of approximately $538,000. These decreases are partially offset by some cost increases in line with increasing customer installations and revenues attributed to our customer growth in this region, including increasing utility costs in our Asia-Pacific IBX centers of $649,000. Our Asia-Pacific costs of revenues are generated in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. There are several managed IT infrastructure service revenue streams unique to our Singapore IBX hub, such as mail service and managed platform solutions, that are more labor intensive than our service offerings in the United States. As a result, our Singapore IBX center has a greater number of employees than any of our other IBX centers, and therefore, a greater labor cost relative to our other IBX centers in the United States or other Asia-Pacific locations. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses decreased to $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. U.S. Sales and Marketing Expenses. U.S. sales and marketing expenses increased to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Included in U.S. sales and marketing expenses were $119,000 and $299,000, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense and amortization expense associated with an intangible asset in connection with our Santa Clara IBX center for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Excluding stock-based compensation and amortization expense, U.S. 49 Table of Contents sales and marketing expenses increased to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, a 12% increase. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel. This increase is primarily due to increased compensation costs of $1.1 million, primarily as a result of growth in our revenue bookings and an increase in the number of sales and marketing headcount. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses decreased to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Included in Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses were $1.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively, of amortization expense associated with several intangible assets associated with our Singapore operations for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Excluding amortization expense, Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses decreased to $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2004 down from $4.8 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of headcount and overall compensation cost reductions in the Singapore region last year of approximately 14% and a decrease in overall discretionary spending due in large part to synergistic savings as a result of the combination that closed on December 31, 2002. Our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses consist of the same type of costs that we incur in our U.S. operations, namely compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel. Our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses are generated in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased to $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $34.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. U.S. General and Administrative Expenses. U.S. general and administrative expenses decreased to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Included in U.S. general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004, were $1.8 million and $1.4 million of depreciation expense and stock-based compensation expense, respectively. Included in U.S. general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003, were $5.3 million and $2.6 million of depreciation expense and stock-based compensation expense, respectively. Depreciation and stock-based compensation expense decreased period over period as certain headquarter-based assets became fully depreciated during the year, and certain stock-based compensation costs became fully amortized. Excluding depreciation and stock-based compensation expense, U.S. general and administrative expenses increased to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $20.4 million for the prior year, an 11% increase. This increase is primarily due to higher professional service fees and other legal-related costs and expenses of $1.8 million, including $733,000 of external costs attributed to our Sarbanes-Oxley compliance initiatives. We continue to incur additional costs related to our Sarbanes-Oxley compliance initiative and this initiative will continue to impose additional costs on Equinix as a public company, both in the form of outside professional service fees for auditors and other advisors, and internal costs related to various devoted teams throughout the organization. We also have higher overall compensation costs of $1.9 million related to annual salary merit increases and corporate bonus programs, as well as an increase in the number of new hires over the past year. In addition, during 2004, we incurred a net charge of $190,000 related to the liquidation of certain legacy subsidiaries in Europe and we do not expect this cost to recur (we initially recorded a charge of $512,000 in the third quarter, which was offset by a reduction in the charge of $322,000 in the fourth quarter as a result of a favorable settlement reached in December 2004). These increases in costs are partially offset by some savings related to the shutdown of the Pihana corporate office in Honolulu that was completed in June 2003, and the relocation of the corporate headquarter office from Mountain View to Foster City in March 2003 totaling $1.9 million. General and administrative expenses, excluding depreciation and stock-based compensation, consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, accounting, legal and administrative expenses, professional service fees and other general corporate expenses such as our corporate headquarter office lease. 50 Table of Contents Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses increased to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Included in Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses were $366,000 and $497,000, respectively, of depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Excluding depreciation, Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses increased to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $5.5 million for the prior year, a 13% increase. This increase is primarily related to an increase in professional service fees of $141,000 related to our Sarbanes-Oxley compliance initiative in Singapore and higher compensation costs of $450,000 as a result of annual merit increases and corporate bonus programs. Our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses consist of the same type of costs that we incur in our U.S. operations, namely salaries and related expenses, accounting, legal and administrative expenses, professional service fees and other general corporate expenses. Our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses are generated in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. Our Asia-Pacific headquarter office is located in Singapore. Most of the corporate overhead support functions that we have in the U.S. also reside in our Singapore office in order to support our Asia-Pacific operations. In addition, we have separate office locations in Hong Kong and Tokyo. Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded restructuring charges of $17.7 million. In light of the availability of fully built-out data centers in select markets at that time at costs significantly below those costs we would incur in building out new space, we made the decision in December 2004 to exit leases for excess space adjacent to one of our New York metro area IBXs, as well as space on the floor above our original Los Angeles IBX. The restructuring charges consisted of (i) a $13.9 million charge representing the present value of our estimated future cash payments, net of any estimated subrental income and expense, through the remainder of these lease terms and (ii) a write-off of property and equipment of $3.8 million, representing the write-off of all remaining property and equipment attributed to the excess space on the floor above our Los Angeles IBX. We entered into a two-year sublease agreement for the excess space in the New York metro area and are currently evaluating opportunities related to our excess space in Los Angeles. We expect that as a result of these restructuring charges, we will realize annual savings in cost of revenues commencing in 2005 of approximately $1.8 million. As of December 31, 2004, we had total accrued restructuring charges of $14.8 million recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet related to these excess lease spaces. For further detailed information on our restructuring charges, see Note 17 of our “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We did not incur any restructuring charges during the year ended December 31, 2003. Interest Income. Interest income increased to $1.3 million from $296,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Interest income increased due to higher average cash, cash equivalent and short-term and long-term investment balances held in interest-bearing accounts during these periods, as well as to increased yields on those balances. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $11.5 million from $20.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the reduction in the principal balance outstanding on our credit facility during 2003 and 2004. These interest expense savings were partially offset by additional non-cash interest expense associated with the $10.0 million 10% convertible secured notes issued on June 5, 2003 as a result of the Crosslink financing. However, during the quarter ended March 31, 2004, with the proceeds from the convertible debenture offering, we fully paid off the remaining credit facility and two other debt facilities, as well as fully redeemed the remaining 13% senior notes that were outstanding. In addition, in March 2004, the $10.0 million 10% convertible secured notes issued in connection with the Crosslink financing were converted to 2.5 million shares of our common stock. As a result of these various repayments, redemption and conversion of our older debt facilities, which have been replaced with our $86.3 million 2.5% convertible subordinated debentures, our interest expense commencing with the second quarter of 2004 was significantly reduced. 51 Table of Contents Loss on Debt Extinguishment and Conversion. In February 2004, with the proceeds from the convertible debenture offering, we fully paid off the remaining credit facility and two other debt facilities, as well as fully redeemed the remaining 13% senior notes that were outstanding at a premium of 106.5% through March 2004. In addition, in March 2004, the 10% $10.0 million convertible secured notes issued in connection with the Crosslink financing, which contained a beneficial conversion feature, were converted to 2.5 million shares of our common stock. As a result of these various repayments, redemption and conversion of our older debt facilities, we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment and conversion of $16.2 million, comprised primarily of the write-off of the various debt issuance costs and discounts associated with these various debt facilities totaling $13.7 million, as well as the premium paid to the holders of our 13% senior notes required to redeem these early and other cash transaction costs totaling $2.5 million. There was no such debt extinguishment or conversion activity during the year ended December 31, 2003. Income Taxes. A full valuation allowance is recorded against our deferred tax assets as management cannot conclude, based on available objective evidence, that it is more likely than not that the value of our deferred tax assets will be realized. However, for the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded $153,000 of income tax expense, primarily representing income taxes related to our international subsidiaries. Liquidity and Capital Resources Since inception, we have financed our operations and capital requirements primarily through the issuance of various debt and equity instruments, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion. As of December 31, 2005, our total indebtedness was comprised of (i) non-convertible debt and financing obligations totaling $186.2 million from our Washington D.C. metro area IBX capital lease, San Jose IBX equipment and fiber financing, Chicago IBX equipment financing, Los Angeles IBX financing, Ashburn campus mortgage payable and a drawdown from our $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line and (ii) convertible debt totaling $86.3 million from our convertible subordinated debentures as outlined below. As of December 31, 2005, our principal source of liquidity was our $188.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. In addition, as of December 31, 2005, we had $13.3 million of additional liquidity available to us under our $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line in the event we need additional cash to pursue attractive strategic opportunities that may become available in the future. While we had generated negative operating cash flow in each annual period since inception through 2003, commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2003 we started to generate positive operating cash flow. Since then, we have generated cash flow from our operations throughout 2004 and 2005 and expect this trend to continue throughout 2006 and beyond. While we expect that our cash flow from operations will continue to grow, due to our recently announced expansion plans in the Washington, D.C. and Chicago metro areas, we expect our cash flow used in investing activities, primarily as a result of our expected purchases of property and equipment to complete these expansion projects, will also increase and are expected to be greater than our cash flows generated from operating activities. As a result, although we believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities, to meet our currently identified business objectives for at least the next twelve months, we will investigate financing opportunities in connection with our Chicago metro area expansion plans in order to minimize expected cash outlays to pursue this project and in order to continue to meet our cash requirements to fund our other capital expenditures, debt service and corporate overhead requirements (excluding the purchases, sales and maturities of our short-term and long-term investments). However, given our limited operating history, additional potential expansion opportunities that we may decide to pursue and other business risks that may cause our operating results to fluctuate, we may not achieve our desired levels of profitability or cash requirements in the future. For further information, refer to “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K above. Sources and Uses of Cash Net cash provided by our operating activities was $67.6 million and $36.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net cash used in our operating activities was $17.3 million for the 52 Table of Contents year ended December 31, 2003. Since the quarter ending September 30, 2003, we have been generating cash from our operations. In prior periods, we used cash primarily to fund our net loss, including cash interest payments on our senior notes and credit facility, although the majority of the operating cash flows used during the year ended December 31, 2003 related to the liquidation of accrued obligations, such as accrued restructuring activities and accrued merger and financing costs. We continue to experience strong collections of our accounts receivables and as our revenues have grown at a much faster pace than our costs, which is due to a significant portion of our costs remaining relatively flat from period to period such as rent for our existing IBX centers, the cash generated from our operations has grown period over period. As described above, we expect that we will continue to generate cash from our operating activities throughout 2006 and beyond. Net cash used in investing activities was $108.7 million, $56.9 million and $49.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of the purchases of the Los Angeles IBX and Ashburn campus properties for $34.7 million and $53.8 million, respectively, and capital expenditures required to bring our recently acquired IBX centers in the Washington, D.C., Silicon Valley, Chicago and Los Angeles metro areas to Equinix standards and to support our growing customer base offset by the net sales and maturities of short-term and long-term investments. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily for the net purchase of short-term and long-term investments, as well as to fund capital expenditures to bring our recently acquired IBX centers in the Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. metro areas to Equinix standards and to support our growing customer base. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2003 was primarily the result of the purchase of short-term investments and some nominal amount of capital expenditures, partially offset by the release of restricted cash to fund a cash interest payment on our senior notes in January 2003. For 2006 and beyond, we anticipate that our cash used in investing activities, excluding the purchases, sales and maturities of short-term and long-term investments, will primarily be for our capital expenditures as well as additional purchases of real estate that we may undertake in the future. In February 2006, we announced the Washington, D.C. metro area IBX expansion project in which we will spend approximately $50.0 to $55.0 million of capital expenditures in order to build this new IBX center in one of the existing and vacant buildings on the Ashburn campus, of which approximately $40.0 million is expected to be incurred in 2006 and which will fulfill our requirement to invest $40.0 million in capital improvements to the Ashburn campus by December 31, 2007 pursuant to the terms of the Ashburn campus financing. Furthermore, in February 2006, we announced the Chicago metro area IBX expansion project in which we may purchase a vacant building for $9.8 million, payable upon closing. If we purchase this building, additional significant capital expenditures would be required in order to build out a new IBX center on this property. Net cash generated by financing activities was $134.6 million, $19.2 million and $52.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net cash generated by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of proceeds of $30.0 million from our drawdown on the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line in October 2005, which we repaid in full in January 2006, proceeds of $60.0 million from our Ashburn campus financing in December 2005, proceeds of $38.1 million from our Los Angeles IBX financing and proceeds from the exercises of warrants and various employee stock plans, offset primarily by principal payments for our various capital lease and other financing obligations. Net cash generated by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004, was primarily the result of the $86.3 million in gross proceeds from our convertible debenture offering, offset by $70.8 million in payments on our credit facility, senior notes and capital lease and other financing obligations, as well as debt extinguishment costs associated with paying down these facilities and $7.3 million in proceeds from our various employee stock plans. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2003 was primarily the result of the $104.4 million in net proceeds of our follow-on equity offering and $10.0 million in proceeds from the Crosslink financing, partially offset by $57.2 million in payments on our credit facility and $6.1 million in payments on our various capital lease and other financing obligations. 53 Table of Contents Debt Obligations—Non-Convertible Debt As of December 31, 2005, our non-convertible debt totaled $186.2 million and was comprised of our (i) Washington D.C. metro area IBX capital lease, (ii) San Jose IBX equipment and fiber financing, (iii) Chicago IBX equipment financing, (iv) Los Angeles IBX financing, (v) Ashburn campus mortgage payable and (vi) our $30.0 million drawdown from our $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2005, in addition to the $30.0 million drawdown described above, we had utilized $6.7 million of the credit line through the issuance of letters of credit, and, as a result, we had $13.3 million of additional liquidity available to us under the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. Washington D.C. Metro Area IBX Capital Lease. In April 2004, we entered into a long-term lease for a 95,000 square foot data center in the Washington, D.C. metro area. The center is adjacent to our existing Washington D.C. metro area IBX center. This lease, which includes the leasing of all of the IBX plant and machinery equipment located in the building, is a capital lease. We took possession of this property during the fourth quarter of 2004, and as a result, recorded property and equipment assets, as well as a capital lease obligation, totaling $35.3 million. Payments under this lease will be made monthly through October 2019 at an effective interest rate of 8.50% per annum. As of December 31, 2005, principal of $34.5 million remained outstanding under this capital lease. San Jose IBX Equipment and Fiber Financing. In December 2004, we entered into a long-term lease for a 103,000 square foot data center in San Jose, and at the same time entered into separate agreements to purchase the equipment located within this new IBX center and to interconnect all three of our Silicon Valley area IBX centers to each other through redundant dark fiber links. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, these three separate agreements are considered to be a single arrangement. Furthermore, while the building component of this transaction is classified as a long-term operating lease, the equipment and fiber portions of the transaction are classified as financed assets. We took possession of this property during the first quarter of 2005, and as a result, recorded property and equipment and prepaid fiber assets, as well as a financing obligation, totaling $18.7 million. Payments under this financing obligation will be made monthly through May 2020 at an effective interest rate of 8.50% per annum. As of December 31, 2005, principal of $15.0 million remained outstanding under this financing obligation. Chicago IBX Equipment Financing. In July 2005, we entered into a long-term sublease for a 107,000 square foot data center in Chicago, and at the same time entered into a separate agreement to purchase the equipment located within this IBX center. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, these two separate agreements are considered to be a single arrangement. Furthermore, while the building component of this transaction is classified as a long-term operating lease, the equipment portion of the transaction is classified as financed assets. We took possession of this property and title to the equipment assets in November 2005, and as a result, recorded IBX equipment assets, as well as a financing obligation, totaling $9.7 million at that time. Payments under this financing obligation will be made monthly through August 2015 at an effective interest rate of 7.50% per annum. As of December 31, 2005, principal of $8.5 million remained outstanding under this financing obligation. Los Angeles IBX Financing. In September 2005, we purchased a 107,000 square foot data center in the Los Angeles metro area for $34.7 million, which we paid for in full with cash in September 2005. In October 2005, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell this Los Angeles IBX for $38.7 million and to lease it back from the purchaser pursuant to a long-term lease, which closed in December 2005 and we received net proceeds from the sale of this property of $38.1 million. However, due to our continuing involvement in regards to certain aspects of this property, the sale and leaseback of this property does not qualify as a sale-leaseback under generally accepted accounting principles, but rather is accounted for as a financing of the property. We refer to this portion of the transaction as the Los Angeles IBX financing. Pursuant to the Los Angeles IBX financing, we recorded a financing obligation liability totaling $38.1 million in December 2005. Payments under the Los Angeles IBX financing will be made monthly through December 2025 at an effective interest rate of 7.75% per annum. As of December 31, 2005, principal of $38.1 million remained outstanding under this financing obligation. 54 Table of Contents Ashburn Campus Mortgage Payable. In December 2005, we completed the financing of our October 2005 purchase of the Ashburn campus property with a $60.0 million mortgage to be amortized over 20 years. Upon receipt of the $60.0 million of cash, which we received in December 2005, we recorded a $60.0 million mortgage payable, which we refer to as the Ashburn campus mortgage payable. Payments under the Ashburn campus mortgage payable, which will commence in February 2006, will be made monthly through January 2026 at an effective interest rate of 8% per annum. As of December 31, 2005, principal of $60.0 million remained outstanding under this mortgage payable. $50.0 Million Silicon Valley Bank Revolving Credit Line. In December 2004, we entered into a $25.0 million line of credit arrangement with Silicon Valley Bank that matured in December 2006. This facility was a $25.0 million revolving line of credit which, at our election, up to $10.0 million could have been converted into a 24-month term loan, repayable in eight quarterly installments. We referred to this transaction as the Silicon Valley Bank credit line. Borrowings under the Silicon Valley Bank credit line bore interest at floating interest rates, plus applicable margins, based either on the prime rate or LIBOR. The Silicon Valley Bank credit line also featured sublimits, which allowed us to issue letters of credit, enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and make advances for cash management services. Our utilization under any of these sublimits would have the effect of reducing the amount available for borrowing under the Silicon Valley Bank credit line during the period that such sublimits remain utilized and outstanding. The Silicon Valley Bank credit line was collateralized by substantially all of our domestic assets and contained numerous covenants, including financial covenants, such as maintaining minimum cash balance levels and meeting minimum quarterly revenue targets. This line of credit remained undrawn since inception. In September 2005, we amended the Silicon Valley Bank credit line by entering into a $50.0 million revolving line of credit agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, replacing the previously outstanding $25.0 million line of credit arrangement with the same bank. The new $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line has a three-year commitment, which enables us to borrow, repay and re-borrow the full amount, up to September 15, 2008. We refer to this transaction as the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. Borrowings under the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line bear interest at floating interest rates, plus applicable margins, based either on the prime rate or LIBOR. In October 2005, we elected to borrow $30.0 million from the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line, which we refer to as the $30.0 million drawdown and which we paid back in full in January 2006. The $30.0 million drawdown was used to fund a portion of the purchase of the Ashburn IBX property acquisition. As of December 31, 2005, the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line had an interest rate of 6.12% per annum. The $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line also features sublimits, which allow us to issue letters of credit, enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and make advances for cash management services. Our utilization under any of these sublimits would have the effect of reducing the amount available for borrowing under the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line during the period that such sublimits remain utilized and outstanding. As of December 31, 2005, we had utilized $6.7 million under the letters of credit sublimit with the issuance of five letters of credit in addition to the $30.0 million drawdown and, as a result, reduced the amount of borrowings available to us from $50.0 million to $13.3 million. The $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line is collateralized by substantially all of our domestic assets and contains several financial covenants which require compliance with maximum leverage ratios, working capital ratios and a minimum EBITDA target, which we were in compliance with as of December 31, 2005. Debt Obligations—Convertible Debt Convertible Secured Notes. In December 2002, in conjunction with our acquisition of i-STT Pte Ltd, STT Communications made a $30.0 million strategic investment in us in the form of a 14% convertible secured note due November 2007. The interest on the convertible secured note was payable in kind in the form of additional convertible secured notes, which we referred to as “PIK notes.” During 2003 and through December 31, 2004, we had issued $8.5 million in PIK notes. The convertible secured note and PIK notes issued to STT Communications were convertible into our preferred and common stock at a price of $9.18 per underlying share, and were convertible anytime at the option of STT Communications. Upon certain conditions, including if the closing price of our common stock exceeded $32.12 per share for thirty consecutive trading days, we had the option of converting the 55 Table of Contents convertible secured notes beginning in 2005. In January 2005, we exercised this right and converted 95% of the outstanding convertible secured notes and unpaid interest totaling $38.0 million into 4.1 million shares of our preferred stock, which were subsequently converted into 4.1 million shares of our common stock in February 2005. We refer to this transaction as the STT convertible secured notes conversion. In November 2005, STT Communications elected to convert the remaining convertible secured notes and unpaid interest totaling $2.2 million, which remained after the 95% STT convertible secured notes conversion in January 2005, into 240,578 shares of our preferred stock, which were then immediately converted into 240,578 shares of our common stock. Convertible Subordinated Debentures. During February 2004, we sold $86.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.5% convertible subordinated debentures due 2024 to qualified institutional buyers. We used the net proceeds from this offering primarily to repay all amounts outstanding under our credit facility and two of our other debt facilities, as well as fully redeemed our remaining 13% senior notes. The interest on the convertible subordinated debentures is payable semi-annually every February and August, which commenced August 2004. Unlike our convertible secured notes, the interest on our convertible subordinated debentures is payable in cash. Our convertible subordinated debentures are convertible into 2.2 million shares of our common stock. Holders of the convertible subordinated debentures may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on February 15, 2009, February 15, 2014 and February 15, 2019, in each case at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, holders of the convertible subordinated debentures may convert their debentures into shares of our common stock upon certain defined circumstances, including during any calendar quarter if the closing price of our common stock is greater than or equal to 120% of $39.50 per share of our common stock, or approximately $47.40 per share, for twenty consecutive trading days during the period of thirty consecutive trading days ending on the last day of the previous calendar quarter. We may redeem all or a portion of the debentures at any time after February 15, 2009 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Debt Maturities, Financings, Leases and Other Contractual Commitments We lease our IBX centers and certain equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements expiring through 2025. The following represents our debt maturities, financings, leases and other contractual commitments as of December 31, 2005 (in thousands): BorrowingsUnderCredit LineandConvertibleSubordinatedDebentures MortgagePayable Capital Leaseand OtherFinancingObligations OperatingLeasesCoveredUnderAccruedRestructuringCharges OperatingLeases (1) OtherContractualCommitments (1) Total 2006 $ 30,000 $ 5,521 $ 9,301 $ 13,499 $ 26,497 $ 67,294 $ 152,112 2007 — 6,022 9,568 13,954 25,735 37 55,316 2008 — 6,022 9,842 13,262 24,592 — 53,718 2009 86,250 6,022 10,122 13,309 24,636 — 140,339 2010 — 6,022 10,409 3,357 24,009 — 43,797 2011 and thereafter — 90,838 128,355 16,607 111,424 — 347,224 116,250 120,447 177,597 73,988 236,893 67,331 792,506 Less amount representing interest — (60,447 ) (87,947 ) — — — (148,394 ) Plus amount representing residual property value — — 6,555 — — — 6,555 Less amount representing estimated subrental income and expense — — — (15,466 ) — — (15,466 ) Less amount representing accretion — — — (8,691 ) — — (8,691 ) $ 116,250 $ 60,000 $ 96,205 $ 49,831 $ 236,893 $ 67,331 $ 626,510 (1) Represents off-balance sheet arrangements. Other contractual commitments are described below. 56 Table of Contents In connection with five of our IBX operating leases, we have entered into five irrevocable letters of credit with Silicon Valley Bank. These letters of credit were provided in lieu of cash deposits under the letters of credit sublimit provision in connection with the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. The letters of credit total $6.7 million, are collateralized by the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line and automatically renew in successive one-year periods until the final lease expiration dates. If the landlords for any of these five IBX operating leases decide to draw down on these letters of credit, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowings under the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. This contingent commitment is not reflected in the table above. As a result of our recent IBX expansions in the Washington D.C., Silicon Valley, Chicago and Los Angeles metro areas, as of December 31, 2005, we were contractually committed for $20.3 million of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for IBX equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided, in connection with the work necessary to bring these acquired IBX centers to Equinix standards prior to making them available to customers for installation. This amount, which is expected to be paid in 2006, is reflected in the table above as an “other contractual commitment.” In addition, although we are not contractually obligated to do so, we expect to incur additional capital expenditures beyond the $20.3 million contractually committed as of December 31, 2005 in these four markets during the first half of 2006 of approximately $15.0 to $25.0 million in order to complete the work needed to bring these new IBXs up to Equinix standards. This non-contractual capital expenditure spending is not reflected in the table above. Furthermore and pursuant to the terms of the Ashburn campus financing, we have agreed to invest at least $40.0 million in capital improvements to the Ashburn campus by December 31, 2007. This $40.0 million contractual commitment, which will be spent on our recently announced Washington, D.C. metro area expansion project and which we expect to pay during 2006, is reflected in the table above as an “other contractual commitment.” Lastly, we have other, smaller future purchase commitments in place as of December 31, 2005, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations, primarily in the U.S. and Singapore, through 2006 and 2007 and other open purchase orders which contractually bind us for good or services to be delivered or provided in 2006. Such other purchase commitments as of December 31, 2005, which total $7.1 million, are also reflected in the table above as an “other contractual commitment.” In February 2006, we entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement to purchase a vacant 228,000 square foot standalone office/warehouse complex in the Chicago metro area for $9.8 million, payable upon closing. The agreement is subject to numerous closing conditions, including the satisfactory completion by us of a comprehensive due diligence review of the property. As part of the evaluation process, we are considering several partnering and financing options for building out this center and are also evaluating options to build out this center in a phased approach. A new center would be interconnected to our downtown Chicago IBX center through redundant dark fiber links managed by us. We refer to this project as the Chicago metro area IBX expansion project. If we purchase this building, additional significant capital expenditures would be required in order to build out a new IBX center on this property. This subsequent event commitment is not reflected in the table above. Summary Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and service offerings, such as our acquisition of the Sprint property in Santa Clara in December 2003, our 2004 expansions in the Washington, D.C. and Silicon Valley metro area markets, our 2005 expansions in the Silicon Valley, Chicago and Los Angeles metro area markets and our 2006 announcements on our intention to build new IBX centers in the Washington, D.C. and Chicago metro areas. However, we will continue to be very selective with any similar opportunity. As was the case with these recent expansions in the Washington, D.C., Silicon Valley, Chicago and Los Angeles area markets, our expansion criteria will be dependent on demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, capacity availability in current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to breakeven and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive for us. Dependent on the particular deal, these acquisitions may 57 Table of Contents require upfront cash payments and additional capital expenditures or may be funded through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these centers up to Equinix standards. Property expansion may be in the form of a purchase of real property, as was the case with our recent Ashburn campus property acquisition, or a long-term leasing arrangement. In addition to our successful strategy of acquiring previously or partially built-out centers, we are also contemplating the possibility of new construction in selective markets where the inventory for high quality data centers is limited, such as our recent announcements on our intention to build new IBX centers in the Washington, D.C. and Chicago metro areas. Decisions to build will consider factors such as customer demand, market pricing and the financial returns associated with the construction. Future purchases or construction may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash. As of December 31, 2005, our principal source of liquidity was our $188.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. In addition, as of December 31, 2005, we had $13.3 million of additional liquidity available to us under our $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line in the event we need additional cash to pursue attractive strategic opportunities that may become available in the future. While we had generated negative operating cash flow in each annual period since inception through 2003, commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2003 we started to generate positive operating cash flow. Since then, we have generated cash flow from our operations throughout 2004 and 2005 and expect this trend to continue throughout 2006 and beyond. While we expect that our cash flow from operations will continue to grow, due to our recently announced expansion plans in the Washington, D.C. and Chicago metro areas, we expect our cash flow used in investing activities, primarily as a result of our expected purchases of property and equipment to complete these expansion projects, will also increase and are expected to be greater than our cash flows generated from operating activities. As a result, although we believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities, to meet our currently identified business objectives for at least the next twelve months, we will investigate financing opportunities in connection with our Chicago metro area expansion plans in order to minimize expected cash outlays to pursue this project and in order to continue to meet our cash requirements to fund our other capital expenditures, debt service and corporate overhead requirements (excluding the purchases, sales and maturities of our short-term and long-term investments). However, given our limited operating history, additional potential expansion opportunities that we may decide to pursue and other business risks that may cause our operating results to fluctuate, we may not achieve our desired levels of profitability or cash requirements in the future. For further information, refer to “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No. 123(R) revises SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock-based compensation, such as employee stock purchase plans and restricted stock awards. In addition, SFAS No. 123(R) supercedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and amends SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.” Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), stock-based compensation awards must meet certain criteria in order for the award to qualify for equity classification. An award that does not meet those criteria will be classified as a liability and be remeasured each period. SFAS No. 123(R) retains the requirements on accounting for the income tax effects of stock-based compensation contained in SFAS No. 123; however, it changes how excess tax benefits will be presented in the statement of cash flows from operating to financing activities. In addition, in March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB No. 107”), which offers guidance on SFAS No. 123(R). SAB No. 107 was issued to assist preparers by simplifying some of the implementation challenges of SFAS No. 123(R) while enhancing the information that investors receive. Key topics of SAB No. 107 include discussion on the valuation models available to preparers and guidance on key assumptions used in these valuation models, such as expected volatility and expected term, as well as guidance on accounting for the income tax effects of SFAS No. 123(R) and disclosure considerations, among other topics. 58 Table of Contents SFAS No. 123(R) and SAB No. 107 were effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005; however in April 2005, the SEC approved a new rule that SFAS No. 123(R) and SAB No. 107 are now effective for public companies for annual, rather than interim, periods beginning after June 15, 2005. As a result, the first quarter of 2006 will be the first period in which we will report stock-based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) and SAB No. 107. We are currently considering the financial accounting, income tax and internal control implications of SFAS No. 123(R), including related FASB Staff Positions issued during 2005 and 2006, and SAB No. 107. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), including related FASB Staff Positions issued during 2005 and 2006, and SAB No. 107 are expected to have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. For further information on our implementation strategy of SFAS No. 123(R), including related FASB Staff Positions issued during 2005 and 2006, and SAB No. 107, refer to our discussion on “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29.” SFAS No. 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets. It eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets contained in APB Opinion No. 29 and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of an entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. As the provisions of SFAS No. 153 are to be applied prospectively, the adoption of SFAS No. 153 will not have an impact on our historical financial statements; however, we will assess the impact of the adoption of this pronouncement on any future nonmonetary transactions that we enter into, if any. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143” (“FIN No. 47”). FIN No. 47 clarifies that the term, conditional retirement obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations”, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN No. 47 further clarifies that the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and/or method of settlement and provides guidance on how an entity might reasonably estimate the fair value of such a conditional asset retirement obligation. FIN No. 47 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FIN No. 47 has not had a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In June 2005, the FASB approved EITF Issue 05-6, “Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements Purchased after Lease Inception or Acquired in a Business Combination” (“EITF 05-6”). EITF 05-6 addresses the amortization period for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination and leasehold improvements that are placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at the beginning of a lease term. EITF 05-6 states that (i) leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of acquisition and (ii) leasehold improvements that are placed into service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased. EITF 05-6 is effective for leasehold improvements that are purchased or acquired in reporting periods beginning after June 29, 2005. The adoption of EITF 05-6 has not had a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2005, the FASB approved EITF Issue 05-7, “Accounting for Modifications to Conversion Options Embedded in Debt Securities and Related Issues” (“EITF 05-7”). EITF 05-7 addresses that the change in the fair value of an embedded conversion option upon modification should be included in the analysis under EITF Issue 96-19, “Debtor’s Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments,” to determine 59 Table of Contents whether a modification or extinguishment has occurred and that changes to the fair value of a conversion option affects the interest expense on the associated debt instrument following a modification. Therefore, the change in fair value of the conversion option should be recognized upon the modification as a discount or premium associated with the debt, and an increase or decrease in additional paid-in capital. EITF 05-7 is effective for all debt modifications in annual or interim periods beginning after December 15, 2005. The adoption of EITF 05-7 will not have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2005, the FASB approved EITF Issue 05-8, “Income Tax Consequences of Issuing Convertible Debt with a Beneficial Conversion Feature” (“EITF 05-8”). EITF 05-8 addresses that (i) the recognition of a beneficial conversion feature creates a difference between the book basis and tax basis (“basis difference”) of a convertible debt instrument, (ii) that basis difference is a temporary difference for which a deferred tax liability should be recorded and (iii) the effect of recognizing the deferred tax liability should be charged to equity in accordance with SFAS No. 109. EITF 05-8 is effective for financial statements for periods beginning after December 15, 2005, and must be adopted through retrospective application to all periods presented. As a result, EITF 05-8 applies to debt instruments that were converted or extinguished in prior periods as well as to those currently outstanding. The adoption of EITF 05-8 will not have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In October 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. SFAS 13-1 (“FSP SFAS 13-1”), which addresses the accounting for rental costs associated with building and ground operating leases that are incurred during a construction period. The FASB decided that such rental costs incurred during a construction period shall be recognized as rental expense. A lessee should cease capitalizing rental costs as of the effective date of FSP SFAS 13-1. The guidance in FSP SFAS 13-1 shall be applied to the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements or interim financial statements that have not yet been issued. A lessee shall cease capitalizing rental costs as of the effective date of FSP SFAS 13-1 for operating lease arrangements entered into prior to the effective date of FSP SFAS 13-1. The adoption of FSP SFAS 13-1 will not have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows as our accounting policy for such rental costs has always been to expense such costs. In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. SFAS 115-1 and SFAS 124-1 (“FSP SFAS 115-1 and 124-1”), which addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss. FSP SFAS 115-1 and 124-1 also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. The guidance in FSP SFAS 115-1 and 124-1 amends FASB Statements No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” and No. 124, “Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not-for-Profit Organizations,” and APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.” The guidance in FSP SFAS 115-1 and 124-1 shall be applied to the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. Early application is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of FSP SFAS 115-1 and 124-1 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments,” an amendment of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” and SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities-a replacement of FASB Statement No. 125.” SFAS No. 155 improves the financial reporting of certain hybrid financial instruments by requiring more consistent accounting that eliminates exemptions and provides a means to simplify the accounting for such instruments. Specifically, SFAS No. 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole (eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host) if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS No. 155 also (i) clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of SFAS No. 133; (ii) establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial 60 Table of Contents assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation; (iii) clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives and (iv) amends SFAS No. 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 155 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk The following discussion about market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent we are exposed to fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity. In the past, we have employed foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging certain specifically identified net currency exposures. The use of these financial instruments was intended to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, but does not eliminate such risks. We may decide to employ such contracts again in the future. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk The Company’s exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. All of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale and are therefore recorded at fair market value on our balance sheet with the unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income or loss. The fair market value of our marketable securities could be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, but we do not believe such impact would be material. Securities with longer maturities are subject to a greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities and as of December 31, 2005 our portfolio maturity was relatively short. If current interest rates were to increase or decrease by 10%, the fair market value of our investment portfolio could increase by approximately $227,000 or decrease by approximately $227,000. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates would furthermore not have a material impact to our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of the majority of our debt obligations. However, the interest expense associated with our $50.0 million revolving credit line, which bears interest at floating rates, plus applicable margins, based on either the prime rate or LIBOR, could be affected. In October 2005, we elected to borrow $30.0 million at a one-month LIBOR interest rate, inclusive of the applicable margin, of 5.72% per annum. Upon the one-month maturity date of the $30.0 million drawdown, we had the opportunity to either repay all or a portion of the $30.0 million drawdown, or convert the $30.0 million drawdown into a new borrowing at either the then applicable one, three or six month LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin or at the prime rate. We elected to continue rolling this drawdown forward in monthly increments at the then applicable one-month LIBOR interest rates, inclusive of the applicable margin, until such time that we decided to repay the $30.0 million drawdown in full in January 2006 at which point the effective interest rate had risen to 6.12%. Therefore, any borrowings from our $50.0 million revolving credit line are subject to interest rate risk as evidenced by the change in interest rates from our recent $30.0 million drawdown. The fair market value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. 61 Table of Contents These interest rate changes may affect the fair market value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair market value of our convertible subordinated debentures is based on quoted market prices. The estimated fair value of our convertible subordinated debentures as of December 31, 2005 was approximately $98.9 million versus approximately $106.2 million as of December 31, 2004. Foreign Currency Risk The majority of our recognized revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, generated mostly from customers in the U.S. However, approximately 13% of our revenues and costs are in the Asia-Pacific region, and a large portion of those revenues and costs are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Singapore dollar, Japanese yen and Hong Kong and Australian dollars. As a result, our operating results and cash flows are impacted by currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. Going forward, we continue to expect that approximately 13-15% of our revenues and costs will continue to be generated and incurred in the Asia-Pacific region in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, to the extent that our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our services less competitive in the international markets. Although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations, and when appropriate, may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations, there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future. Commodity Price Risk Certain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of price changes are electricity and supplies and equipment used in our IBX centers. We are closely monitoring the cost of electricity at all of our locations. In addition, as we now intend to start building new, “greenfield” IBX centers, we will be subject to commodity price risk for building materials related to the construction of these IBX centers, such as steel and copper. In addition, the lead-time to procure certain pieces of equipment is substantial, such as generators. Any delays in procuring the necessary pieces of equipment for the construction of our IBX centers could delay the anticipated openings of these new IBX centers and, as a result, increase the cost of these projects. We do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk.",2023-12-30 20:28:07.404313
1101239,EQIX,EQUINIX INC,2007,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information in this discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements are based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. For example, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Overview Equinix provides network neutral colocation, interconnection and managed services to enterprises, content companies, systems integrators and the world’s largest network providers. Through our IBX centers in 10 markets in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific, customers can directly interconnect with each other for critical traffic exchange requirements. As of December 31, 2006, we operate IBX centers in the Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. metro areas in the United States and Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo in the Asia-Pacific region. Direct interconnection to our aggregation of networks, which serve more than 90% of the world’s Internet routes, allows our customers to increase performance while significantly reducing costs. Based on our network neutral model and the quality of our IBX centers, we believe we have established a critical mass of customers. As more customers locate in our IBX centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to do so as well to gain the full economic and performance benefits of direct interconnection. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a “network effect” of customer adoption. Our interconnection services enable scalable, reliable and cost-effective interconnection and traffic exchange thus lowering overall cost and increasing flexibility. Our focused business model is based on our critical mass of customers and the resulting network effect. This critical mass and the resulting network effect, combined with our strong financial position, continue to drive new customer growth and bookings. Historically, our market has been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled their telecommunications products and services with their colocation offerings. A number of these telecommunications carriers have eliminated or reduced their colocation footprint to focus on their core businesses. In 2003, as an example, one major telecommunications company, Sprint, announced its plans to exit the colocation and hosting market in order to focus on its core service offerings, while another telecommunications company, Cable & Wireless Plc, sold its U.S. assets to another telecommunications company, Savvis Communications Corp, in a bankruptcy auction. In 2005 and 2006, other providers, such as Abovenet and Verio, have selectively sold off certain of their colocation centers. Each of these colocation providers own and operate a network. We do not own or operate a network, yet have greater than 200 networks operating out of our IBX centers. As a result, we are able to offer our customers a substantial choice of networks given our network neutrality thereby allowing our customers to choose from numerous network service providers. We believe this is a distinct and sustainable competitive advantage, especially when the telecommunications industry is experiencing many business challenges and changes as evidenced by the numerous bankruptcies and consolidations within this industry during the past several years. Furthermore, this industry consolidation has constrained the supply of suitable data center space and has had a positive effect on industry pricing. 31 Table of Contents Our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus total cabinet space available. Our utilization rate grew to 56% as of December 31, 2006 from 54% as of December 31, 2005; however, excluding the impact of our recent IBX center openings in the Chicago, Los Angeles and Silicon Valley metro areas, our utilization rate would have been 63% as of December 31, 2006. Although we have substantial capacity for growth, our utilization rates vary from market to market among our IBX centers in the 10 markets across the U.S. and Asia-Pacific. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. Once capacity becomes limited, we will perform demand studies to determine if future expansion is warranted. In addition, power and cooling requirements for some customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of draw our customers take from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain of our high power demand customers. We could face power limitations in our centers even though we may have additional physical capacity available within a specific IBX center. This could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows. As a result of these power limitations in our existing IBX centers, the maximum utilization rate that we expect to achieve for most IBX centers until we consider an IBX center full or sold-out is approximately 75-80% depending on the building configurations. Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and service offerings, such as our acquisition of the Sprint property in Santa Clara in December 2003, our 2004 expansions in the Washington, D.C. and Silicon Valley metro area markets, our 2005 expansions in the Silicon Valley, Chicago and Los Angeles metro area markets and our 2006 expansions in the Washington, D.C., Chicago, New York and Tokyo, Japan metro area markets, which are expected to open in 2007 (see “Recent Developments” below). However, we will continue to be very selective with any similar opportunity. As was the case with these recent expansions in the Washington, D.C., Silicon Valley, Chicago, Los Angeles and Tokyo area markets, our expansion criteria will be dependent on demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, capacity availability in current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to break-even and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. Dependent on the particular deal, these acquisitions may require upfront cash payments and additional capital expenditures or may be funded through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these centers up to Equinix standards. Property expansion may be in the form of a purchase of real property, as was the case with our recent Washington, D.C. and Chicago metro area property acquisitions, or a long-term leasing arrangement. In addition to our successful strategy of acquiring previously or partially built-out centers, we are currently undergoing construction to build out new IBX centers in the Washington, D.C, Chicago and New York metro areas. As part of our strategy, we will continue to contemplate the possibility of new construction in selective markets where the inventory for high quality data centers is limited. Decisions to build will consider factors such as customer demand, market pricing and the financial returns associated with the construction. Future purchases or construction may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant. Recent Developments In January 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved stock options to be granted to employees, excluding executive officers, to purchase an aggregate of 648,500 shares of common stock as part of our annual refresh program. In addition, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors also approved the issuance of 250,000 restricted shares of common stock to executive officers. The restricted shares are subject to four-year vesting, and will only vest at certain time intervals and if the stock appreciates to pre-determined levels. In January 2007, the Stock Option Committee of the Board of Directors approved stock options to be granted to employees, excluding executive officers, to purchase an aggregate of 511,310 shares of common stock as part of our annual refresh program. In addition, the Compensation Committee of the Board of 32 Table of Contents Directors approved the issuance of 178,400 restricted stock units to certain employees, excluding executive officers, also as part of our annual refresh program. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors also approved the issuance of an aggregate of 218,000 shares of restricted common stock and restricted stock units to executive officers pursuant to the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan. All awards are subject to vesting provisions. All such equity awards were accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” and related pronouncements, which had a significant impact to us. We expect stock-based compensation expense related to these equity awards to impact our results of operations through 2011. For further information on stock-based compensation, refer to “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” in “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below. In February 2006, we announced our intention to build out a new IBX center within our Ashburn campus in order to further expand our existing Washington, D.C. metro area IBX center. We refer to this project as the Washington, D.C. metro area IBX expansion project. In May 2006, we began new construction to build out one of the undeveloped buildings located on our Ashburn campus. We expect to spend approximately $60.0 million for the Washington, D.C. metro area IBX expansion project until completion, of which $54.0 million was incurred during the year ended December 31, 2006. We intend to open this new center for customers in the first quarter of 2007. This IBX center will feature an updated design that will enable us to support the increased power and cooling demands of customers. The Washington, D.C. metro area IBX expansion project will fulfill our obligation to invest at least $40.0 million in capital improvements to our Ashburn campus by December 31, 2007 pursuant to the terms of the Ashburn campus mortgage payable. In December 2006, we received an additional financing of $40.0 million under the same terms as the initial Ashburn campus mortgage payable, which increased the Ashburn campus mortgage payable from an initial $60.0 million to $100.0 million. In June 2006, we purchased a 228,000 square foot stand-alone office/warehouse complex in the Chicago metro area for $9.8 million, including closing costs, which we paid for in full during June 2006. We are building this IBX center, which will be our second IBX center location in the Chicago metro area, in multiple phases. We refer to this project as the Chicago metro area IBX expansion project. This new IBX center will be interconnected to our existing downtown Chicago IBX centers through redundant dark fiber links managed by us. We plan to invest approximately $175.0 million to build out the first phase, of which approximately $37.8 million was incurred in 2006. This includes an investment of approximately $40.0 million to construct a specially built 250,000 square foot shell, acquire access to power and provision fiber for interconnection to our downtown Chicago IBX center location. The site development plan allows for a second expansion phase at an incremental investment of $30.0 million. We intend to open the new center for customers during the second half of 2007. In February 2007, we obtained a construction loan of up to $110.0 million which has a term of three years and bears interest at a floating rate (one, three or six month LIBOR plus 2.75%), with an initial rate of 8.125%, to finance a portion of the development and construction costs of the Chicago metro area IBX expansion project. We refer to this transaction as the Chicago IBX financing. We have currently drawn $20.0 million on the Chicago IBX financing and expect to be fully drawn on the Chicago IBX financing by the end of 2007. In June 2006, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors commenced an independent investigation of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting with the assistance of independent outside legal counsel. This review covered the timing and pricing of all stock option grants made under our stock option plans since August 11, 2000, the day after our initial public offering. Following our investigation, we received an informal inquiry from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California (“U.S. Attorney”) requesting documents relating to our stock option grants and practices. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors concluded that we did not engage in intentional or fraudulent misconduct in the granting of stock options. However, the accounting measurement dates for certain historical stock option grants differed from their actual grant dates. As a result of revising the accounting measurement dates for these stock option grants, we recorded additional non-cash stock-based compensation charge totaling $444,000 in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006. The amount of the charge was computed pursuant to the requirements of APB 25 for all historical periods through December 31, 2005 and pursuant to SFAS 123(R) for the year ended December 31, 2006. This $444,000 33 Table of Contents stock-based compensation charge represents the total charge for historical periods that we needed to record as a result of the Audit Committee’s conclusion on this matter. This compensation charge had no effect on our current cash position. We concluded that the cumulative charge as a result of the difference between the measurement dates used for financial accounting and reporting purposes and the actual grant dates for certain stock option grants, totaling $444,000, was not material to any previously-reported historical period nor is it material to the current fiscal year. As such, this cumulative charge totaling $444,000 was recorded in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006. In December 2006, the SEC formally notified us that it had terminated its investigation of our stock option grants and practices and no enforcement action was recommended. In January 2007, the U.S Attorney formally notified us of the withdrawal of its grand jury subpoena. As fully described in “Legal Proceedings” in Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, shareholder derivative actions were filed in connection with this matter. In August 2006, we amended the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line to increase the line to $75.0 million and added General Electric Capital Corporation as a lender. We refer to this transaction as the $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. The $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line allows for issuance of letters of credit (in addition to revolving borrowings). The $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line also has an option for us to increase the amount of the line to $100.0 million at a later date, subject to approval of the lender or lenders electing to participate in such increase. Borrowings under the $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line will continue to bear interest at variable interest rates, plus the applicable margins based on either prime rates or LIBOR rates. The $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line matures on September 15, 2008, is secured by substantially all of our domestic personal property assets and certain of our real property leases, and contains several financial covenants, which require compliance with maximum leverage and working capital ratios and a minimum EBITDA target, all of which we were in compliance with as of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See “Debt Obligations—Non-Convertible Debt” below for further discussion. In September 2006, we entered into a long-term lease for an approximately 340,000 square foot building in the New York metro area. We intend to build an IBX center, which will be our third IBX center in the New York metro area, and this new center will be interconnected to our existing IBX centers in the New York metro area through redundant dark fiber links managed by us. We refer to this project as the New York metro area IBX expansion project. Payments under this lease total $59.4 million, which will be paid in monthly installments and payable through September 2021. The lease, which commenced in October 2006, contains a three-year option to purchase the building for $39.0 million. We intend to build out the new center in multiple phases and expect to open the first phase for customers during the second half of 2007. We intend to invest approximately $95.0 million to build out the first phase of the new center, of which approximately $2.2 million was incurred in 2006. We expect to finance at least 60% of the capital expenditures required to complete the New York metro area IBX expansion project in the form of short and long-term financing arrangements, which we expect to obtain in 2007. In December 2006, we sold our Honolulu IBX center for $9.8 million of gross cash proceeds. We refer to this sale as the Honolulu IBX Sale. The Honolulu IBX center was originally acquired by us in our acquisition of Pihana Pacific, Inc. on December 31, 2002, which we refer to as the Pihana acquisition. The Honolulu IBX was ascribed a nominal book value in the Pihana acquisition and was our smallest IBX center in our smallest market. We entered into an agreement to sell the Honolulu IBX center to a company led by former Equinix personnel in November 2006. The Honolulu IBX Sale will enable us to focus on more strategic markets, such as the New York, Chicago, Washington, D.C. and Tokyo metro areas, where we expect to open new IBX centers in 2007. In December 2006, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into (i) an asset purchase agreement with VSNL International Japan K.K, or VSNL, for the purchase of certain IBX equipment for $7.5 million in cash, which we refer to as the Tokyo equipment, which also required that we enter into a colocation services agreement with VSNL whereby VSNL will be our customer for 10 years at agreed-upon rates, which we refer to as the VSNL customer contract, and (ii) a long-term operating lease, with an initial term of ten years, for a 73,000 square foot data center in the Tokyo metropolitan area with another, unrelated party, which we refer to as the 34 Table of Contents Tokyo IBX building operating lease. We refer to these transactions as the Tokyo IBX acquisition. This data center will be interconnected to our existing Tokyo IBX center through redundant dark fiber links managed by us. Payments under the Tokyo IBX building operating lease will be made monthly, commencing in December 2006, and will be payable through December 2016, totaling approximately 1.8 billion Japanese yen (approximately $15.1 million as translated using effective exchange rates at December 31, 2006) in cumulative lease payments. We note that the Tokyo equipment had a fair value of $14.2 million versus the $7.5 million of cash paid for it. The difference in fair value versus cash consideration was addressed by the below-market rates in the VSNL customer contract, which we refer to as VSNL customer contract discount. As a result, the Tokyo equipment purchase was a part-monetary and part-nonmonetary transaction. Pursuant to APB Opinion No. 29, “Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions”, and EITF 01-2, “Interpretations of APB Opinion No. 29”, we accounted for the Tokyo equipment entirely at fair value. This resulted in us recording unearned revenue of $6.7 million, the fair value of the VSNL customer contract discount, which we will recognize into revenue over the 10 year term of the VSNL customer contract. In February 2007, we entered into an agreement to purchase the building and property where our original Silicon Valley IBX center is located for $65.0 million, which is expected to close no later than November 2007. We intend to finance substantially all of the cost of the property acquisition, following an initial $6.5 million deposit paid with cash in February 2007. In February 2007, we announced our plan to expand our Singapore IBX center. We expect to finalize a new lease agreement for a new floor in the building where our current Singapore IBX center is located by the end of the first quarter of 2007. We intend to spend approximately $12.0 million to build out this new floor, which we expect to open for business during the second half of 2007. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: • Accounting for stock-based compensation; • Accounting for restructuring charges; and • Accounting for income taxes. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. We adopted the provisions of, and account for stock-based compensation in accordance with, SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” and related pronouncements (“SFAS 123(R)”) effective January 1, 2006. As a result of our adoption of SFAS 123(R), we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $30.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded stock-based compensation expense in accordance with APB 25 of $8.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively. The fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model while the fair value of our restricted stock grants, which have a market price condition, were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation option-pricing model. The determination of the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and highly subjective variables. 35 Table of Contents These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors or expected term, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. We record stock-based compensation expense on stock awards expected to vest during the period net of estimated forfeitures. The estimated forfeitures on unvested stock awards are assessed based on our historical stock awards activity and our expectations about future employee turnover, and these rates are subject to revision in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Higher forfeitures will result in lower stock-based compensation expense while lower forfeiture rates will result in higher stock-based compensation expense. We estimate the expected volatility by using the average historical volatility of our common stock that we believe is the best representative of the future volatility. The expected term of options used is calculated by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option, as illustrated in SAB 107. The risk-free interest rate used is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on our equity awards. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, therefore, the expected dividend rate used is zero. During the year ended December 31, 2006, stock options granted to employees had a total fair value of $39.2 million. Changes in assumptions (as well as different option-pricing models used for estimating the fair value of stock awards) can significantly affect our future period expense. Based on our analysis, the table below presents the possible impact of increases or decreases of individual variables (representing increases/decreases of 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%) in the assumptions to the fair value of employee stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands): Expected volatility Risk-free interest rate Expected life Weightedaveragerate Increase/decreasein fairvalue(%) (1)Increase/decreasein totalexpense Weightedaveragerate Increase/decreasein fairvalue(%) (1)Increase/decreasein totalexpense Weightedaveragelife Increase/decreasein fairvalue(%) (1)Increase/decreasein totalexpense 69%(2) 4.70 %(2) 4.56 (2) 76% 6.62 % $ 2,594 5.17 % 0.80 % $ 312 5.02 4.04 % $ 1,584 83% 12.86 % 5,041 5.64 % 1.59 % 622 5.47 7.77 % 3,048 90% 18.72 % 7,337 6.11 % 2.37 % 930 5.93 11.24 % 4,405 97% 24.18 % 9,478 6.58 % 3.15 % 1,237 6.38 14.46 % 5,668 62% -6.97 % (2,733 ) 4.23 % -0.80 % (314 ) 4.10 -4.39 % (1,720 ) 55% -14.27 % (5,594 ) 3.76 % -1.61 % (630 ) 3.65 -9.18 % (3,599 ) 48% -21.86 % (8,570 ) 3.29 % -2.42 % (947 ) 3.19 -14.44 % (5,662 ) 41% -29.70 % (11,642 ) 2.82 % -3.23 % (1,267 ) 2.74 -20.27 % (7,947 ) (1) Increase/decrease in total expense over the entire vesting period of the individual equity awards is calculated based on percentage increase/decrease in fair value to the total fair value of $39.2 million of our employee stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2006. (2) Variables used in calculating the fair value of our employee stock options granted for the year ended December 31, 2006. The table above shows that changes in expected volatility present the most significant impact to the increases/decreases of stock-based compensation expense compared to changes in other variables. Assuming other variables remained unchanged, had the expected volatility increased by 40%, our stock-based compensation expense recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been approximately $1.1 million higher than the reported stock-based compensation expense (the above table demonstrates potential changes to the total value of equity awards, which is generally amortized over four years). Had the expected volatility decreased by 40%, our stock-based compensation expense recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been approximately $1.3 million lower than the reported stock-based compensation expense. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. 36 Table of Contents The guidance in SFAS 123(R) and SAB 107 is relatively new. The application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time. There are significant differences among valuation models, and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future. This may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock-based payments. It may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models, methods and assumptions. Accounting for Restructuring Charges. We account for restructuring activities in accordance with SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” We recorded restructuring charges totaling $33.8 million and $17.7 million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 for the exit of certain leases. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 146, we had to estimate the future cash payments required to exit these leases, net of any estimated sublease income and expense, through the remainder of these lease terms and then determine the present value of such future cash flows to record the appropriate restructuring charges. Subsequent to the period in which the initial restructuring charge was taken, we record accretion expense to accrete our accrued restructuring liabilities up to an amount equal to the total estimated future cash payments necessary to complete the exit of these leases. SFAS No. 146 requires us to assume sublease income for these leases and two of these leases extend through 2015. Furthermore, one of these leases currently continues to be unoccupied as it remains a difficult property to market. Therefore, significant and inherently uncertain sublease assumptions were required at the time we recorded these restructuring charges. If we are unable to generate sublease income in the same amount that was projected at the time we recorded the initial restructuring charges, we will need to revise these restructuring charges accordingly. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded an additional restructuring charge of $1.5 million as a result of revised sublease assumptions related to the 2004 restructuring charge. We expect that in the future, additional restructuring charge adjustments will recur as we periodically adjust these sublease assumptions to reflect current facts and circumstances. Accounting for Income Taxes. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and whether deferred tax assets will be recoverable in full or in part. We calculate our tax provision in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Our estimates and assumptions used in the provision may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified and settled. When it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carry-forwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are not recoverable. The valuation allowance is determined pursuant to SFAS No. 109 which requires the assessment of both positive and negative evidence. Such assessment should be performed on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. We have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in the U.S. and we intend to maintain the same position for fiscal 2006 based on the assessment of the positive and negative evidence present. In addition, we continued to provide a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in all of our foreign jurisdictions other than Singapore. During fiscal 2006, we released the valuation allowance of $6.9 million against the net deferred tax assets for the entity in Singapore that operates our local IBX center there, primarily reducing goodwill, as we believed it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets with this entity will be realized in future years based on the current and expected future profitability of this entity. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with the inherent uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which we operate. We are also subject to examinations by various taxing authorities. We believe we have adequately reserved in our financial statements for potential tax liabilities including penalties and interest. If events occur and the payment of the reserved tax liability ultimately proves to be unnecessary, we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period when we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. If, however, the reserved liability proves to be less than the ultimate assessment including penalties and interest, a further charge to expense would become necessary. 37 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 were split between the following revenue classifications (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2006 % 2005 % Recurring revenues $ 273,160 95 % $ 208,003 94 % Non-recurring revenues: Installation and professional services 13,734 5 % 12,193 5 % Other 21 0 % 861 1 % 13,755 5 % 13,054 6 % Total revenues $ 286,915 100 % $ 221,057 100 % Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 were geographically comprised of the following (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2006 % 2005 % U.S. revenues $ 246,066 86 % $ 191,390 87 % Asia-Pacific revenues 40,849 14 % 29,667 13 % Total revenues $ 286,915 100 % $ 221,057 100 % We recognized revenues of $286.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to revenues of $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a 30% increase. We analyze our business geographically between the U.S. and Asia-Pacific as further discussed below. Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation, interconnection and managed infrastructure services. We consider these services recurring as our customers are billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues are a significant component of our total revenues comprising greater than 90% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Historically, approximately half of our then existing customers order new services in any given quarter representing greater than half of the new orders received in each quarter. Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer’s initial deployment and professional services that we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring as they are billed typically once and only upon completion of the installation or professional services work performed. These non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer. As a percent of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future. Other non-recurring revenues are comprised primarily of customer settlements, which represent fees paid to us by customers who wish to terminate their contracts with us prior to their expiration. In addition to reviewing recurring versus non-recurring revenues, we look at two other primary metrics when we analyze our revenues: 1) customer count and 2) utilization. On a consolidated basis, our customer count increased to 1,290 as of December 31, 2006 versus 1,138 as of December 31, 2005, an increase of 13%. Our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus total cabinet space available. On a consolidated basis, our utilization rate grew to 56% as of December 31, 2006 from 54% as of December 31, 2005; however, excluding the impact of our recent IBX center openings in the Chicago, Los Angeles and Silicon Valley metro areas, our utilization rate would have been 63% as of December 31, 2006. Although we have substantial capacity for growth, our utilization rates vary from market to market among our IBX centers in the 10 38 Table of Contents markets across the U.S. and Asia-Pacific. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. Once capacity becomes limited, we perform demand studies to determine if future expansion is warranted. In addition, power and cooling requirements for some customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of draw our customers take from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain of our high power demand customers. We could face power limitations in our centers even though we may have additional physical capacity available within a specific IBX center. This could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows. As a result of these power limitations in our existing IBX centers, the maximum utilization rate that we expect to achieve for most IBX centers until we consider an IBX center full or sold-out is approximately 75-80% depending on the building configurations. Therefore, consistent with our recent expansion efforts in the Chicago, Los Angeles, Silicon Valley, Tokyo and Washington, D.C. metro area markets, we will continue to closely manage available space and power capacity in each of our operating markets and expect to continue to make strategic and selective expansions to our global footprint when and where appropriate. U.S. Revenues. We recognized U.S. revenues of $246.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. U.S. revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $235.4 million and $180.4 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, a 30% increase. U.S. recurring revenues consist primarily of colocation and interconnection services plus a nominal amount of managed infrastructure services and, commencing in the fourth quarter of 2005, in connection with our October 2005 purchase of the Ashburn campus property, a nominal amount of recurring rental income from the other tenants located on this property that we now own, which totaled $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The period over period growth in recurring revenues was primarily the result of an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers acquired during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate as discussed above, and selective price increases in each of our IBX markets. The total increase in revenues as a result of selective price increases for the year ended December 31, 2006 was approximately $3.7 million. In addition, we recorded $7.9 million of revenues from our new IBX centers in the Chicago, Los Angeles and Silicon Valley metro areas, which opened for business during the year ended December 31, 2006. We expect our U.S. recurring revenues, particularly colocation and interconnection services, to continue to remain our most significant source of revenue for the foreseeable future. In addition, U.S. revenues consisted of non-recurring revenues of $10.7 million and $11.0 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Non-recurring revenues are primarily related to the recognized portion of deferred installation, professional services and settlement fees associated with certain contract terminations. Included in U.S. non-recurring revenues are settlement fees of $817,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005. There were no such settlement fees for the year ended December 31, 2006. Offsetting some of this non-recurring revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 were service level credits that we recorded totaling $457,000 that were issued or will be issued to certain of our customers related to two separate power outages in our Chicago and Washington, D.C. metro area IBX centers. There were no significant service level credits recorded in the year ended December 31, 2006. In addition, we recorded a reduction of $1.2 million to our non-recurring installation revenues as a result of our adoption of SAB 108 during the quarter ended December 31, 2006. Excluding settlements and service level credits, U.S. non-recurring revenues, consisting of the recognized portion of deferred installation and professional services, increased 5% period over period, primarily due to strong existing and new customer growth during the year. In December 2006, we sold our Honolulu IBX center and, as a result, subsequent to the sale we no longer recognize revenues from this IBX center. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized $2.3 million of revenue from our Honolulu IBX center or less than 1% of our total U.S. revenues. We expect that this loss of revenue going forward will be more than offset by revenue growth in our existing U.S. IBX centers, as well as the new U.S. IBX centers opening during 2007 in the Washington, D.C., Chicago and New York metro area markets. 39 Table of Contents Asia-Pacific Revenues. We recognized Asia-Pacific revenues of $40.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $29.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a 38% increase. Asia-Pacific revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $37.8 million and $27.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, consisting primarily of colocation and managed infrastructure services. In addition, Asia-Pacific revenues consisted of non-recurring revenues of $3.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Asia-Pacific non-recurring revenues included $21,000 and $44,000, respectively, of contract settlement revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Asia-Pacific revenues are generated from Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo, with Singapore representing approximately 39% and 45%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Our Asia-Pacific colocation revenues are similar to the revenues that we generate from our U.S. IBX centers; however, our Singapore IBX center has additional managed infrastructure service revenue, such as mail service and managed platform solutions, which we do not currently offer in any other IBX center location. The growth in our Asia-Pacific revenues is primarily the result of an increase in the customer base in this region during the past year, particularly in Hong Kong, Sydney and Tokyo. We expect that our Asia-Pacific revenues will continue to grow during 2007, especially in Tokyo, as a result of our December 2006 expansion there, which while currently operational for one customer, will be open for business for additional customers commencing in the second half of 2007. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues were $188.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $158.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a 19% increase. The largest cost components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX centers, utility costs including electricity and bandwidth, IBX employees’ salaries and benefits, supplies and equipment and security services. A substantial majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period. However, there are certain costs, which are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies that are directly related to growth of services in our existing and new customer base. We expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will increase in the future on a per-unit or fixed basis in addition to on a customer growth or variable basis. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months as compared to other times of the year. U.S. Cost of Revenues. U.S. cost of revenues was $165.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $138.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. U.S. cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 included (i) $65.0 million of depreciation expense, (ii) $3.5 million of accretion expense comprised of $536,000 for our asset retirement obligations and $3.0 million for our restructuring charges for certain leasehold interests recorded in 2004 and 2005 as we accrete the related liabilities to the total estimated future cash payments needed, (iii) $2.7 million of stock-based compensation as a result of our adoption of SFAS 123(R) effective January 1, 2006 and (iv) $721,000 of amortization expense associated with the intangible assets acquired with our Ashburn campus. U.S. cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 included (i) $57.1 million of depreciation expense and (ii) $1.9 million of accretion expense comprised of $504,000 for our asset retirement obligations and $1.4 million for our restructuring charges for certain leasehold interests recorded in 2004 and 2005 as we accrete the related liabilities to the total estimated future cash payments needed. Our U.S. cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 also included $17.7 million of additional operating costs not incurred in the prior year associated with the recently opened IBX centers in the Chicago, Los Angeles and Silicon Valley metro areas (the Chicago and Los Angeles IBX centers opened for business during the three months ended June 30, 2006, and the Silicon Valley IBX center opened for business during the three months ending September 30, 2006). Excluding depreciation, accretion expense, stock-based compensation, amortization expense and the costs associated with operating our new IBX centers, U.S. cost of revenues increased period over period to $81.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $77.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a 4% increase. This increase was primarily the result of increases in (i) utility costs of approximately $6.3 million in line with increasing customer installations and revenues attributed to customer growth, (ii) compensation costs of approximately $2.9 million, including general salary increases and bonuses and headcount growth and (iii) repair and maintenance expenses of approximately $906,000. This increase was partially offset by a reduction of approximately $7.4 million in rent expense in connection with a 40 Table of Contents property we recorded a restructuring charge for in San Jose in the fourth quarter of 2005 and the purchase of the previously leased Ashburn campus property in October 2005. In December 2006, we sold our Honolulu IBX center. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $1.3 million in costs of revenue for the Honolulu IBX center, representing less than 1% of our total U.S. cost of revenues. Our cost of revenues will no longer include the costs related to the Honolulu IBX center. However, we continue to anticipate that our cost of revenues will increase in the foreseeable future to the extent that the occupancy levels in our U.S. IBX centers increase, as newly opened IBX centers in the Chicago, Los Angeles and Silicon Valley metro areas commence operations more fully in 2007 and as the new IBX centers in the Washington, D.C., Chicago and New York metro area markets open for business during 2007. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 included (i) $3.5 million of depreciation expense, (ii) $497,000 of stock-based compensation as a result of our adoption of SFAS 123(R) effective January 1, 2006 and (iii) $260,000 of non-cash rent expense associated with the value attributed to warrants issued in May 2004 to our landlord in connection with a lease amendment for our Hong Kong IBX center. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 included $3.6 million of depreciation expense and $259,000 of non-cash rent expense. Excluding depreciation, stock-based compensation and non-cash rent expense, Asia-Pacific cost of revenues increased period over period to $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a 15% increase. This increase was primarily the result of increasing utility and bandwidth costs in line with increasing customer installations and revenues attributed to this customer growth. Our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues is generated in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. There are several managed infrastructure service revenue streams unique to our Singapore IBX center, such as mail service and managed platform solutions that are more labor intensive than our service offerings in the United States. We anticipate that our cost of revenues will increase in the foreseeable future to the extent that the occupancy levels in our Asia-Pacific IBX centers increase and as the newly acquired IBX center in Tokyo, Japan commences its operations more fully in 2007. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased to $32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. U.S. Sales and Marketing Expenses. U.S. sales and marketing expenses increased to $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Included in U.S. sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $6.8 million of stock-based compensation expense and $60,000 of amortization expense associated with an intangible asset in connection with our Santa Clara IBX center. Included in U.S. sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $1.6 million of stock-based compensation expense and $60,000 of amortization expense. The increase in stock-based compensation expense period over period is a result of our adoption of SFAS 123(R) effective January 1, 2006. Excluding stock-based compensation and amortization expense, U.S. sales and marketing expenses increased to $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a 33% increase. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel. This increase was primarily due to (i) approximately $3.9 million of higher compensation costs, including increases in sales compensation related to strong new customer bookings throughout 2006 and general salary increases and bonuses for our marketing staff and non-commissioned sales staff and (ii) approximately $815,000 of higher travel costs related to our customer and revenue growth. Going forward, we expect U.S. sales and marketing spending to increase nominally in absolute dollars as we continue to grow our business. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses increased to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Included in Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $600,000 of stock-based compensation as a result of our adoption of SFAS 123(R) effective January 1, 2006. 41 Table of Contents Excluding stock-based compensation, Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses were $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 versus $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a 30% increase. This increase was primarily due to approximately $413,000 of higher compensation costs as a result of the strong revenue growth in this region and an increase in bad debt expense of approximately $303,000 over the same period last year (the prior year actually had negative bad debt expense as a result of some recoveries of aged receivables previously written-off). Our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses consist of the same types of costs that we incur in our U.S. operations, namely compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel. Our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses are generated in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. We expect that our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses will experience growth in the foreseeable future. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased to $72.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $45.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. U.S. General and Administrative Expenses. U.S. general and administrative expenses increased to $60.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $37.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Included in U.S. general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $17.7 million of stock-based compensation expense and $3.0 million of depreciation expense. Included in U.S. general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $6.7 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1.7 million of depreciation expense. The increase in stock-based compensation expense period over period is a result of our adoption of SFAS 123(R) effective January 1, 2006. Excluding stock-based compensation expense and depreciation expense, U.S. general and administrative expenses increased to $39.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $28.9 million for the same period last year, a 38% increase. This increase was primarily due to (i) approximately $4.4 million of higher compensation costs, including general salary increases, bonuses and headcount growth (175 U.S. general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2006 versus 152 as of December 31, 2005), (ii) an increase in professional fees of approximately $5.0 million due to increased legal fees in connection with our legal matters such as the review of our past stock option grants and practices, accounting fees and other consulting projects in connection with our growth strategies, (iii) an increase in rent, repair and maintenance expenses of approximately $676,000 in connection with our office expansion in Foster City, California and (iv) an increase in travel expenses of approximately $593,000. General and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation, consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, accounting, legal and other professional service fees and other general corporate expenses such as our corporate headquarters office lease. Going forward, we expect U.S. general and administrative spending to increase as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth. Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses increased to $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Included in Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $2.5 million of stock-based compensation as a result of our adoption of SFAS 123(R) effective January 1, 2006 and $229,000 of depreciation expense. Included in Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $284,000 of depreciation expense. Excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation, Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses increased to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $7.5 million for the same period last year, a 17% increase. This increase was primarily due to approximately $913,000 of higher compensation costs, including general salary increases and bonuses. Our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses consist of the same types of costs that we incur in our U.S. operations, namely salaries and related expenses, accounting, legal and other professional service fees and other general corporate expenses. Our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses are generated in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. Our Asia-Pacific headquarters office is located in Singapore. Most of the corporate overhead support functions that we have in the U.S., such as finance, legal, marketing and information technology, also reside in our Singapore office in order to support our Asia-Pacific operations; however, each of our Asia-Pacific locations in Hong Kong, Sydney and Tokyo also have 42 Table of Contents general and administrative staff dedicated to each specific operation. In addition to our Asia-Pacific headquarters office in Singapore, we also have separate office locations in Tokyo and Hong Kong (the Sydney general and administrative staff work out of the Sydney IBX center). We expect that our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses will experience some growth in the foreseeable future. Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded an additional restructuring charge of $1.5 million as a result of revised sublease assumptions on two of our excess space leases in the New York and Los Angeles metro areas as a result of new information becoming available. The original restructuring charge for these two leases was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 and totaled $17.7 million. We are contractually committed to these two excess space leases through 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a restructuring charge of $33.8 million, which we refer to as the 2005 restructuring charge. In light of the availability of fully or partially built-out data centers in the Silicon Valley, including the possibility of expansion in or near some of the four IBX centers we currently have in the Silicon Valley, we made the decision that retaining the approximately 40 acre San Jose ground lease for future expansion was no longer economical. In conjunction with this decision, we entered into an agreement with the landlord of this property for an early termination of the San Jose ground lease whereby we would pay $40.0 million over four years, commencing January 1, 2006, to terminate this lease, which would otherwise require significantly higher cumulative lease payments through 2020. The restructuring charge consisted of (i) a $32.3 million charge representing the present value of our estimated future cash payments to exit this property, which is net of $4.4 million of deferred rent previously accrued for this lease (thereby creating a total restructuring liability of $36.7 million associated with this lease) and (ii) a write-off of property and equipment of $1.5 million representing development costs incurred to date to prepare this land for use. We expect, as a result of this restructuring charge, we will realize annual savings in cost of revenues of approximately $5.6 million. For further detailed information on our restructuring charges, see Note 19 of our “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Gain on Honolulu IBX sale. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a $9.6 million gain in connection with the sale of our Honolulu IBX center. We sold this IBX center for $9.8 million in gross cash proceeds. Interest Income. Interest income increased to $6.6 million from $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest income increased due to higher average cash, cash equivalent and short-term and long-term investment balances held in interest-bearing accounts during these periods, as well as higher yields on those balances due to increased interest rates. The average annualized yield for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 4.53% versus 3.32% for the year ended December 31, 2005. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $14.9 million from $8.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to increases in interest expense associated with the new financings entered into during 2006 and 2005: (i) the $9.7 million financing for equipment we purchased in connection with our Chicago IBX acquisition in November 2005, which bears interest at 7.50%; (ii) the $38.1 million financing in connection with our Los Angeles IBX financing in December 2005, which bears interest at 7.75%; and (iii) the $100.0 million mortgage payable, which bears interest at 8.00%, in connection with our Ashburn campus financing, of which $60.0 million was borrowed in December 2005 and the remaining $40.0 million was borrowed in December 2006. This increase was partially offset by the debt conversion activities during the fiscal year 2005 that resulted in a decrease in interest expense. In November 2005, STT Communications converted the remaining 5% of the outstanding 14% convertible secured notes and unpaid interest totaling $2.2 million into 240,578 shares of our preferred stock, which was immediately converted into 240,578 shares of our common stock. Furthermore, in connection with various construction projects related to our IBX expansion efforts during the year ended December 31, 2006, we capitalized $1.6 million of interest expense to construction in progress. We did not capitalize any interest during the year ended December 31, 2005 as no material amounts of interest qualified for capitalization. Going forward, we expect to incur higher interest expense as we obtain additional financing to fund our expansion efforts. 43 Table of Contents Income Taxes. During fiscal 2006, we recorded $439,000 of income tax provision primarily representing U.S. alternative minimum tax and a net tax benefit from our operation in Singapore, which resulted from the release of the valuation allowance in the jurisdiction. During fiscal 2005, we recorded $543,000 of income tax provision consisting of U.S. alternative minimum tax and foreign income tax. A valuation allowance is recorded against the net deferred tax assets in all the jurisdictions other than Singapore as management can not conclude, based on the available objective evidence including recurring historical losses, that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets are recoverable in future years. However, management believed that as of December 31, 2006, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be fully recoverable in Singapore, as the positive evidence present in the jurisdiction is sufficient to overcome the negative evidence. We have not incurred any significant income tax expense since inception and we do not expect to incur any meaningful income tax expense during 2007. Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle. As a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a reduction of expense totaling $376,000, which is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on our statement of operations for this period. This amount reflects the application of an estimated forfeiture rate to partially vested employee equity awards as of January 1, 2006 that we accounted for under APB 25, which was primarily for restricted stock awards to our executive officers that were granted during the three months ended March 31, 2005. Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 were split between the following revenue classifications (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2005 % 2004 % Recurring revenues $ 208,003 94 % $ 154,449 94 % Non-recurring revenues: Installation and professional services 12,193 5 % 8,333 5 % Other 861 1 % 889 1 % 13,054 6 % 9,222 6 % Total revenues $ 221,057 100 % $ 163,671 100 % Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 were geographically comprised of the following (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2005 % 2004 % U.S. revenues $ 191,390 87 % $ 141,598 87 % Asia-Pacific revenues 29,667 13 % 22,073 13 % Total revenues $ 221,057 100 % $ 163,671 100 % We recognized revenues of $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to revenues of $163.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a 35% increase. In addition to reviewing recurring versus non-recurring revenues, we look at two other primary metrics when we analyze our revenues: 1) customer count and 2) utilization. Our customer count increased to 1,138 as of December 31, 2005 versus 950 as of December 31, 2004, an increase of 20%. Our utilization rate grew to 54% as of December 31, 2005 from 45% as of December 31, 2004; however, excluding the impact of our most recent expansions in the Washington, D.C. and Silicon Valley area markets, our utilization rate would have been 58% as of December 31, 2005. 44 Table of Contents U.S. Revenues. We recognized U.S. revenues of $191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $141.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. U.S. revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $180.4 million and $134.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, a 34% increase. As a result of our October 2005 purchase of the Ashburn campus property, we recognized a nominal amount of recurring rental income from the other tenants located on this property that we now own, which totaled $312,000. U.S. recurring revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 included $9.8 million of revenue generated from the recently acquired Washington, D.C. area and Silicon Valley area IBX centers, which opened for business in the fourth quarter of 2004 and first quarter of 2005, respectively. Excluding revenues from these recently acquired U.S. IBX centers, the period over period growth in recurring revenues was primarily the result of an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers acquired during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and weighted-average utilization rate as discussed above, and selective price increases in each of our IBX markets. In addition, U.S. revenues consisted of non-recurring revenues of $11.0 million and $7.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Included in U.S. non-recurring revenues were settlement fees of $817,000 and $609,000, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Offsetting some of this non-recurring revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 were service level credits that we recorded totaling $457,000 that were issuable to certain of our customers related to two separate power outages in our Chicago and Washington, D.C. metro area IBX centers. There were no significant service level credits recorded in the year ended December 31, 2004. Excluding settlements and service level credits, U.S. non-recurring revenues, consisting of the recognized portion of deferred installation and professional services, increased 58% period over period, primarily due to strong existing and new customer growth during the year, as well as the completion of certain custom projects for the U.S. government during the quarter ended March 31, 2005. Asia-Pacific Revenues. We recognized Asia-Pacific revenues of $29.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a 34% increase. Asia-Pacific revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $27.6 million and $20.2 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, consisting primarily of colocation and managed infrastructure services. In addition, Asia-Pacific revenues consisted of non-recurring revenues of $2.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Asia-Pacific non-recurring revenues included $44,000 and $280,000, respectively, of contract settlement revenue for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Asia-Pacific revenues were generated from Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo, with Singapore representing approximately 45% and 52%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. The growth in our Asia-Pacific revenues was primarily the result of an increase in the customer base in this region during the past year, particularly in Hong Kong, Sydney and Tokyo. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues were $158.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $136.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a 16% increase. U.S. Cost of Revenues. U.S. cost of revenues was $138.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $118.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. U.S. cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 included (i) $57.1 million of depreciation expense and (ii) $1.9 million of accretion expense comprised of $504,000 for our asset retirement obligations and $1.4 million for our restructuring charges for certain leasehold interests recorded in 2004 and 2005 as we accrete the related liabilities to the total estimated future cash payments needed. U.S. cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 included (i) $50.1 million of depreciation expense; (ii) $35,000 of stock-based compensation expense; (iii) $355,000 of accretion expense associated with our asset retirement obligation for our various leasehold interests; and (iv) $147,000 of amortization expense associated with the intangible asset acquired with our Santa Clara IBX center that became fully amortized in December 2004. Our U.S. cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 also included $6.4 million of additional operating costs not incurred in the prior year associated with the recently acquired Washington, D.C. and Silicon Valley metro area IBX centers, which opened for business in the fourth quarter of 2004 and first quarter of 2005, respectively, plus $1.5 million of costs attributed to our three most 45 Table of Contents recently acquired IBX centers in Sunnyvale, Chicago and Los Angeles which were available to customers in 2006. Excluding depreciation, stock-based compensation, accretion expense, amortization expense and the costs associated with operating our new IBX centers, U.S. cost of revenues increased period over period to $71.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $67.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a 5% increase. This increase was primarily the result of increasing utility costs in line with increasing customer installations and revenues attributed to customer growth partially offset by savings of approximately $1.8 million in operating costs, primarily rent, in connection with a property we recorded a restructuring charge for in Los Angeles in December 2004. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 included $3.6 million of depreciation expense and $259,000 of non-cash rent expense associated with the value attributed to warrants issued in May 2004 to our landlord in connection with a lease amendment for our Hong Kong IBX center. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 included $3.7 million of depreciation expense and $194,000 of non-cash rent expense. Excluding depreciation and non-cash rent expense, Asia-Pacific cost of revenues increased period over period to $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a 10% increase. This increase was primarily the result of increasing utility and bandwidth costs in line with increasing customer installations and revenues attributed to this customer growth. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased to $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. U.S. Sales and Marketing Expenses. U.S. sales and marketing expenses increased to $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Included in U.S. sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $1.6 million of stock-based compensation expense and $60,000 of amortization expense associated with an intangible asset in connection with our Santa Clara IBX center. Included in U.S. sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $60,000 of stock-based compensation expense and $59,000 of amortization expense associated with an intangible asset in connection with our Santa Clara IBX center. The increase in the stock-based compensation expense period over period was a result of the non-cash charge attributed to restricted stock awards granted to our sales and marketing executive officers in the first quarter of 2005. Excluding stock-based compensation and amortization expense, U.S. sales and marketing expenses increased to $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a 16% increase. This increase was primarily due to approximately $1.9 million of higher compensation costs, including increases in sales compensation related to strong new customer bookings throughout 2005, general salary increases and bonuses for our marketing staff and non-commissioned sales staff, as well as some moderate headcount growth (68 U.S. sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2005 versus 65 as of December 31, 2004); however, this growth was partially offset by additional recoveries of bad debt expense over the prior year of approximately $190,000 due to a strong and successful collections effort on aged receivables previously written-off. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses decreased to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Included in Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $1.8 million of amortization expense associated with several intangible assets associated with our Singapore operations, which were fully amortized in December 2004. Excluding amortization expense, Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses were $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 versus $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a nominal 3% increase. While there was an increase of approximately $138,000 in higher compensation costs during this period, including increases in sales compensation related to strong new customer bookings throughout 2005, particularly in Hong Kong, Sydney and Tokyo, general salary increases and bonuses for our marketing staff and non-commissioned sales staff, as well as some moderate headcount growth (27 Asia-Pacific sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2005 versus 26 as of December 31, 2004) 46 Table of Contents and an increase in related travel and entertainment costs of approximately $132,000, this growth was mostly offset by additional recoveries of bad debt expense over the prior year of approximately $224,000 due to a strong and successful collections effort on aged receivables previously written-off. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased to $45.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. U.S. General and Administrative Expenses. U.S. general and administrative expenses increased to $37.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Included in U.S. general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $6.7 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1.7 million of depreciation expense. Included in U.S. general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $1.4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1.8 million of depreciation expense. The increase in the stock-based compensation expense period over period was primarily a result of the non-cash charge attributed to restricted stock awards granted to our executive officers in the first quarter of 2005, net of forfeitures for two of these executive officers that terminated their employment with us during the first quarter of 2006. Excluding stock-based compensation expense and depreciation expense, U.S. general and administrative expenses increased to $28.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $22.7 million for the prior period, a 27% increase. This increase was primarily due to approximately $5.2 million of higher compensation costs, including general salary increases, bonuses, headcount growth (152 U.S. general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2005 versus 126 as of December 31, 2004) and $986,000 related to accrued severance charges related to two of our officers that terminated their employment with us, as well as an increase in professional fees, primarily approximately $175,000 of costs associated with the STT divestiture transaction completed in November 2005. Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses increased to $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Included in Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses were $284,000 and $366,000, respectively, of depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Excluding depreciation, Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses increased to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $6.2 million for the prior period, a 21% increase. This increase was primarily due to approximately $1.2 million of higher compensation costs, including general salary increases and bonuses, as well as some headcount growth (85 Asia-Pacific general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2005 versus 72 as of December 31, 2004). Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a restructuring charge of $33.8 million, which we refer to as the 2005 restructuring charge, as previously described. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded restructuring charges of $17.7 million, which we refer to as the 2004 restructuring charge. In light of the availability of fully built-out data centers in select markets at costs significantly below those costs we would incur in building out new space, we made the decision in December 2004 to exit leases for excess space adjacent to one of our New York metro area IBXs, as well as space on the floor above our original Los Angeles IBX. The restructuring charges consisted of (i) a $13.9 million charge representing the present value of our estimated future cash payments, net of any estimated subrental income and expense, through the remainder of these lease terms and (ii) a write-off of property and equipment of $3.8 million, representing the write-off of all remaining property and equipment attributed to the excess space on the floor above our Los Angeles IBX. We entered into a two-year sublease agreement for the excess space in the New York metro area and are currently evaluating opportunities related to our excess space in Los Angeles and the current restructuring charge for these properties is based on the best available information. As a result of these restructuring charges, primarily relating to the Los Angeles property, we realized annual savings in cost of revenues of approximately $1.8 million during 2005. Interest Income. Interest income increased to $3.6 million from $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest income increased due to higher average cash, cash equivalent 47 Table of Contents and short-term and long-term investment balances held in interest-bearing accounts during these periods, as well as higher yields on those balances due to increased interest rates. The average annualized yield for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 3.32% versus 1.64% for the year ended December 31, 2004. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $8.9 million from $11.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. During the first quarter of 2005, we converted 95% of the outstanding 14% convertible secured notes and unpaid interest totaling $38.0 million held by STT Communications into 4.1 million shares of our preferred stock, which was subsequently converted into 4.1 million shares of our common stock in February 2005. In addition, STT Communications converted the remaining 5% of the outstanding 14% convertible secured notes and unpaid interest totaling $2.2 million into 240,578 shares of our preferred stock, which was immediately converted into 240,578 shares of our common stock in November 2005. These conversion activities resulted in a decrease in interest expense in 2005, offset in part by interest expense associated with (i) the $35.3 million capital lease obligation we recorded in connection with the Washington, D.C. metro area IBX center during the fourth quarter of 2004, which bears interest at 8.50%; (ii) the $18.7 million financing we recorded in connection with the Silicon Valley metro area IBX center equipment and fiber during the first quarter of 2005, which bears interest at 8.50%; (iii) the $9.7 million financing for equipment we purchased in connection with our Chicago IBX acquisition in November 2005, which bears interest at 7.50%; (iv) the $38.1 million financing we recorded in connection with our Los Angeles IBX financing in December 2005, which bears interest at 7.75%; (v) the $60.0 million mortgage payable we recorded in connection with our Ashburn campus financing in December 2005, which bears interest at 8.00% and (vi) the $30.0 million borrowing from our $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line during October 2005, which bore interest at an initial rate of 5.72% and was fully repaid in January 2006. Loss on Debt Extinguishment and Conversion. In February 2004, with the proceeds from our convertible debenture offering in February 2004, discussed below, we paid off the remaining $34.3 million credit facility and two other smaller debt facilities with a combined total of $2.9 million of principal remaining, as well as redeemed the remaining $30.5 million 13% senior notes that were outstanding at a premium of 106.5% through March 2004. In addition, in March 2004, the 10% $10.0 million convertible secured notes issued in connection with the Crosslink financing, and which had a beneficial conversion feature, were converted to 2.5 million shares of our common stock. As a result of these various repayments, redemption and conversion of our older debt facilities, we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment and conversion of $16.2 million, comprised primarily of the write-off of the various debt issuance costs and discounts associated with these various debt facilities totaling $13.7 million, as well as the premium paid to the holders of our 13% senior notes required to redeem these early and other cash transaction costs totaling $2.5 million. There was no loss recorded in connection with the STT convertible secured notes conversion activity during the year ended December 31, 2005 as the STT convertible secured notes did not have a beneficial conversion feature at the time of issuance on December 31, 2002. Income Taxes. A full valuation allowance is recorded against our net deferred tax assets as management cannot conclude, based on available objective evidence including recurring historical losses, that it is more likely than not that the net value of our deferred tax assets will be realized. However, for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded $543,000 and $153,000, respectively, of income tax expense, primarily representing income taxes related to alternative minimum tax and foreign jurisdictions. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity in recent years have been cash flow generated from operating activities, debt financing including convertible debt, mortgages and term debt, and equity financing arising from sale of common stock and exercises of stock options. As of December 31, 2006, our total indebtedness was comprised of (i) non-convertible debt and financing obligations totaling $193.6 million from our Washington D.C. metro area IBX capital lease, San Jose IBX equipment and fiber financing, Chicago IBX equipment financing, Los Angeles IBX financing and Ashburn campus mortgage payable and (ii) convertible debt totaling $86.3 million from our convertible subordinated debentures as outlined below. 48 Table of Contents We believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities and anticipated cash from financings, to meet our operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2006, we had $156.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. Since the quarter ended September 30, 2003, we have generated positive operating cash flow in each quarter and expect this trend to continue throughout 2007 and beyond. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, we had $58.6 million of additional liquidity available to us under the $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line in the event we need additional cash to fund expansion activities, fund working capital requirements or pursue attractive strategic opportunities that may become available in the future. In addition, from time to time we assess external financing opportunities, both debt and equity, as alternative sources for financing such activities and opportunities. In February 2007, our wholly-owned subsidiary obtained a loan of up to $110.0 million, which has a term of three years and bears interest at a floating rate (one, three or six month LIBOR plus 2.75%), with an initial rate of 8.125%, to finance a portion of the development and construction costs of the Chicago metro area IBX expansion project, which we refer to as the Chicago IBX financing. While we expect that our cash flow from operations will continue to increase, we expect our cash flow used in investing activities, primarily as a result of our expected purchases of property and equipment to complete these expansion projects, will also increase and we expect them to be greater than our cash flows generated from operating activities. Given our limited operating history, additional potential expansion opportunities that we may decide to pursue and other business risks that may cause our operating results to fluctuate, we may not achieve our desired levels of profitability or cash requirements in the future. For further information, refer to “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K above. Sources and Uses of Cash Net cash provided by our operating activities was $75.4 million, $67.6 million and $36.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This increase was primarily due to improved operating results, excluding the increase in stock-back compensation as a result of our adoption of SFAS 123(R) in 2006; however, these improved operating results were mostly offset by additional restructuring charge payments as a result of our 2005 and 2004 restructuring charges. While this increased level of restructuring charge payments has had an impact on our ability to grow our cash from operating activities, we expect that we will continue to generate cash from our operating activities throughout 2007 and beyond. Net cash used in investing activities was $158.5 million, $108.7 million and $56.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of the capital expenditures required to bring our recently opened IBX centers in the Chicago, Los Angeles and Silicon Valley metro areas to Equinix standards, our current IBX expansion projects in the Washington, D.C., Chicago, New York and Tokyo metro areas, which will open during 2007, and to support our growing customer base, as well as the net purchases of $3.5 million of our short-term and long-term investments and the purchase of our Chicago IBX property in June 2006 for $9.8 million, offset by the proceeds from the sale of our Honolulu IBX in December 2006 of $9.5 million. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of the purchases of the Los Angeles IBX and Ashburn campus properties for $34.7 million and $53.8 million, respectively, and capital expenditures required to bring our recently acquired IBX centers in the Washington, D.C., Silicon Valley, Chicago and Los Angeles metro areas to Equinix standards and to support our growing customer base offset by the net sales and maturities of short-term and long-term investments of $12.2 million. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily for the net purchase of short-term and long-term investments of $36.1 million, as well as to fund capital expenditures of $22.9 million to bring our recently acquired IBX centers in the Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. metro areas to Equinix standards and to support our growing customer base. For 2007 and beyond, we anticipate that our cash used in investing activities, excluding the purchases, sales and maturities of short-term and long-term investments, will primarily be for our capital expenditures, which we expect to be substantial, as well as additional purchases of real estate that we may undertake in the future. 49 Table of Contents Net cash provided by financing activities was $46.1 million, $134.6 million and $19.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006, was primarily due to the $40.0 million borrowing under the $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line in September 2006, the $40.0 million additional financing under the Ashburn campus mortgage payable in December 2006 and proceeds from the exercises of employee stock options and purchases from our employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by the repayment of $70.0 million in borrowings under the $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line and principal payments of $2.6 million for our capital lease and other financing obligations and the Ashburn campus mortgage payable. Net cash generated by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of proceeds of $30.0 million from our borrowing on the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line in October 2005, which we repaid in full in January 2006, proceeds of $60.0 million from our Ashburn campus financing in December 2005, proceeds of $38.1 million from our Los Angeles IBX financing and proceeds from the exercises of warrants and various employee stock plans, offset primarily by principal payments of $5.5 million for our various capital lease and other financing obligations. Net cash generated by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004, was primarily the result of the $86.3 million in gross proceeds from our convertible debenture offering, offset by $70.8 million in payments on our credit facility, senior notes and capital lease and other financing obligations, as well as debt extinguishment costs associated with paying down these facilities and $7.3 million in proceeds from our various employee stock plans. We expect to obtain additional financings in 2007, such as the Chicago IBX financing, in order to fund our expansion plans. Debt Obligations—Non-Convertible Debt As of December 31, 2006, our non-convertible debt totaled $193.6 million and was comprised of our (i) Washington D.C. metro area IBX capital lease, (ii) San Jose IBX equipment and fiber financing, (iii) Chicago IBX equipment financing, (iv) Los Angeles IBX financing and (v) Ashburn campus mortgage payable. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2006, we had utilized $16.4 million of the credit line through the issuance of letters of credit and, as a result, we had $58.6 million of additional liquidity available to us under the $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. Washington D.C. Metro Area IBX Capital Lease. In April 2004, we entered into a long-term lease for a 95,000 square foot data center in the Washington, D.C. metro area. The center is adjacent to our existing Washington D.C. metro area IBX center. This lease, which includes the leasing of all of the IBX plant and machinery equipment located in the building, is a capital lease. We took possession of this property during the fourth quarter of 2004, and as a result, recorded property and equipment assets, as well as a capital lease obligation, totaling $35.3 million. Payments under this lease will be made monthly through October 2019 at an effective interest rate of 8.50% per annum. As of December 31, 2006, principal of $33.7 million remained outstanding under this capital lease. San Jose IBX Equipment and Fiber Financing. In December 2004, we entered into a long-term lease for a 103,000 square foot data center in San Jose, and at the same time entered into separate agreements to purchase the equipment located within this new IBX center and to interconnect all three of our Silicon Valley area IBX centers to each other through redundant dark fiber links. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, these three separate agreements are considered to be a single arrangement. Furthermore, while the building component of this transaction is classified as a long-term operating lease, the equipment and fiber portions of the transaction are classified as financed assets. We took possession of this property during the first quarter of 2005, and as a result, recorded property and equipment and prepaid fiber assets, as well as a financing obligation, totaling $18.7 million. Payments under this financing obligation will be made monthly through May 2020 at an effective interest rate of 8.50% per annum. As of December 31, 2006, principal of $14.8 million remained outstanding under this financing obligation. Chicago IBX Equipment Financing. In July 2005, we entered into a long-term sublease for a 107,000 square foot data center in Chicago, and at the same time entered into a separate agreement to purchase the equipment located within this IBX center. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, these two separate 50 Table of Contents agreements are considered to be a single arrangement. Furthermore, while the building component of this transaction is classified as a long-term operating lease, the equipment portion of the transaction is classified as financed assets. We took possession of this property and title to the equipment assets in November 2005, and as a result, recorded IBX equipment assets, as well as a financing obligation, totaling $9.7 million at that time. Payments under this financing obligation will be made monthly through August 2015 at an effective interest rate of 7.50% per annum. As of December 31, 2006, principal of $8.1 million remained outstanding under this financing obligation. Los Angeles IBX Financing. In September 2005, we purchased a 107,000 square foot data center in the Los Angeles metro area for $34.7 million, which we paid for in full with cash in September 2005. In October 2005, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell this Los Angeles IBX for $38.7 million and to lease it back from the purchaser pursuant to a long-term lease, which closed in December 2005, and we received net proceeds from the sale of this property of $38.1 million. However, due to our continuing involvement in regards to certain aspects of this property, the sale and leaseback of this property does not qualify as a sale-leaseback under generally accepted accounting principles, but rather is accounted for as a financing of the property. We refer to this portion of the transaction as the Los Angeles IBX financing. Pursuant to the Los Angeles IBX financing, we recorded a financing obligation liability totaling $38.1 million in December 2005. Payments under the Los Angeles IBX financing will be made monthly through December 2025 at an effective interest rate of 7.75% per annum. As of December 31, 2006, principal of $38.1 million remained outstanding under this financing obligation. Ashburn Campus Mortgage Payable. In December 2005, we completed the financing of our October 2005 purchase of the Ashburn campus property with a $60.0 million mortgage to be amortized over 20 years. Upon receipt of the $60.0 million of cash in December 2005, we recorded a $60.0 million mortgage payable. Payments under the Ashburn campus mortgage payable will be made monthly through January 2026 at an effective interest rate of 8% per annum. In December 2006, we obtained an additional financing of $40.0 million under the Ashburn campus mortgage payable, which increased the total amount financed under the Ashburn campus mortgage payable to $100.0 million, on the same terms as the initial mortgage payable. As of December 31, 2006, principal of $98.9 million remained outstanding under this mortgage payable. $75.0 Million Silicon Valley Bank Revolving Credit Line. In August 2006, we amended the Silicon Valley Bank credit line by entering into a $75.0 million revolving line of credit agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, replacing the previously outstanding $50.0 million line of credit arrangement, and adding General Electric Capital Corporation (GE) as a lender. The $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line allows for issuance of letters of credit (in addition to revolving borrowings). The $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line also has an option for us to increase the amount of the line to $100.0 million at a later date, subject to approval of the lender or lenders electing to participate in such increase. Borrowings under the $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line will continue to bear interest at variable interest rates, plus the applicable margins which were in effect prior to the amendment, based on either prime rates or LIBOR rates. As of December 31, 2006, we had a total of $16.4 million of outstanding letters of credit under the letters of credit sublimit of the $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line reducing the amount of borrowings available to us to $58.6 million. These letters of credit automatically renew in successive one-year periods until the final termination. If the beneficiaries of these letters of credit decide to draw down on these letters of credit, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowings under the $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. As of December 31, 2006, if we had borrowed against the Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line, our borrowings would have had an effective interest rate of 7.82% per annum. The $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line matures on September 15, 2008 and is secured by substantially all of our domestic personal property assets and certain of our real property leases and contains several financial covenants, which require compliance with maximum leverage and working capital ratios and a minimum EBITDA target, all of which we were in compliance with as of December 31, 2006. Chicago IBX financing. In February 2007, our wholly-owned subsidiary obtained a loan of up to $110.0 million to finance a portion of the development and construction costs of the Chicago metro area IBX expansion 51 Table of Contents project, of which $20.0 million of this loan was drawn at closing. The remaining amount of the Chicago IBX financing will be drawn down during the construction period of the Chicago metro area IBX expansion project and we expect that the full $110.0 million will be fully drawn down by the end of 2007. The Chicago IBX financing has a term of three years and bears interest at a floating rate (one, three or six month LIBOR plus 2.75%), with an initial rate of 8.125%. The Chicago IBX financing has no specific financial covenants. In addition, the Chicago IBX Financing contains a limited parent company guaranty. Debt Obligations—Convertible Debt Convertible Subordinated Debentures. During February 2004, we sold $86.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.5% convertible subordinated debentures due 2024 to qualified institutional buyers. We used the net proceeds from this offering primarily to repay all amounts outstanding under our credit facility and two of our other debt facilities, as well as fully redeemed our remaining 13% senior notes. The interest on the convertible subordinated debentures is payable semi-annually every February and August and is payable in cash. Our convertible subordinated debentures are convertible into 2.2 million shares of our common stock. Holders of the convertible subordinated debentures may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on February 15, 2009, February 15, 2014 and February 15, 2019, in each case at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, holders of the convertible subordinated debentures may convert their debentures into shares of our common stock upon certain defined circumstances, including during any calendar quarter if the closing price of our common stock is greater than or equal to 120% of $39.50 per share of our common stock, or approximately $47.40 per share, for twenty consecutive trading days during the period of thirty consecutive trading days ending on the last day of the previous calendar quarter. We may redeem all or a portion of the debentures at any time after February 15, 2009 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Debt Maturities, Financings, Leases and Other Contractual Commitments We lease our IBX centers and certain equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements expiring through 2025. The following represents our debt maturities, financings, leases and other contractual commitments as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Convertiblesubordinateddebentures Mortgagepayable Capital leasesand otherfinancingobligations Operatingleases coveredunder accruedrestructuringcharges Operatingleases (1) Othercontractualcommitments(1) Total 2007 — 9,820 9,587 13,953 32,911 121,378 187,649 2008 — 10,164 9,860 13,262 32,741 5,797 71,824 2009 86,250 10,164 10,134 13,309 32,639 518 153,014 2010 — 10,164 10,409 3,357 31,368 477 55,775 2011 — 10,164 10,703 3,464 26,452 545 51,328 2012 and thereafter — 143,668 117,651 13,143 137,840 2,725 415,027 86,250 194,144 168,344 60,488 293,951 131,440 934,617 Less amount representing interest — (95,248 ) (80,200 ) — — — (175,448 ) Plus amount representing residual property value — — 6,555 — — — 6,555 Less amount representing estimated subrental income and expense — — — (12,570 ) — — (12,570 ) Less amount representing accretion — — — (6,345 ) — — (6,345 ) $ 86,250 $ 98,896 $ 94,699 $ 41,573 $ 293,951 $ 131,440 $ 746,809 52 Table of Contents (1) Represents off-balance sheet arrangements. Other contractual commitments are described below. In connection with six of our IBX operating leases and one utilities contract, we have entered into seven irrevocable letters of credit with Silicon Valley Bank. These letters of credit were provided in lieu of cash deposits under the letters of credit sublimit provision of the $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. The letters of credit total $16.4 million, are collateralized by the $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line and automatically renew in successive one-year periods until the final termination. If the beneficiaries of these letters of credit decide to draw down on these letters of credit, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowings under the Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. This contingent commitment is not reflected in the table above. Primarily as a result of our recent IBX expansions in the Chicago, Washington D.C. and New York metro areas, as of December 31, 2006, we were contractually committed for $94.6 million of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for IBX equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided, in connection with the work necessary to open these IBX centers prior to making them available to customers for installation. This amount, which is expected to be paid in 2007, is reflected in the table above as “other contractual commitment.” We have other, non-capital purchase commitments in place as of December 31, 2006, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations, primarily in the U.S. and Singapore, through 2007 and thereafter and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods or services to be delivered or provided during 2007. Such other purchase commitments as of December 31, 2006, which total $36.8 million, are also reflected in the table above as an “other contractual commitments.” In addition, although we are not contractually obligated to do so, we expect to incur additional capital expenditures beyond the $94.6 million contractually committed as of December 31, 2006 in these three markets, as well as Tokyo, during 2007 of approximately $160.0 million to $170.0 million in order to complete the work needed to open these IBX centers. These non-contractual capital expenditures are not reflected in the table above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments,” an amendment of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” and SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities-a replacement of FASB Statement No. 125” (“SFAS No. 155”). SFAS No. 155 improves the financial reporting of certain hybrid financial instruments by requiring more consistent accounting that eliminates exemptions and provides a means to simplify the accounting for such instruments. Specifically, SFAS No. 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole (eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host) if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS No. 155 also (i) clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of SFAS No. 133; (ii) establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation; (iii) clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives and (iv) amends SFAS No. 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 155 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In April 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FIN 46(R)-6 (“FSP FIN 46(R)-6”), which addresses how a reporting enterprise should determine the variability to be considered in applying FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”, as amended (“FIN 46(R)”). The variability that is considered in applying FIN 46(R) affects the determination of (a) whether the entity is a variable interest 53 Table of Contents entity, (b) which interests are variable interests in the entity and (c) which party, if any, is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. That variability will affect any calculation of expected losses and expected residual returns, if such a calculation is necessary. FSP FIN 46(R)-6 provides additional guidance to consider for determining variability. FSP FIN 46(R)-6 is effective beginning the first day of the first reporting period beginning after June 15, 2006. The adoption of FSP FIN 46(R)-6 has not had a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. In June 2006, the FASB approved EITF Issue No. 06-3, “How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That is, Gross versus Net Presentation)” (“EITF 06-3”). EITF 06-3 includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include, but is not limited to, sales, use, value added and some excise taxes. EITF 06-3 concludes that the presentation of taxes on either a gross (included in revenue and costs) or a net (excluded from revenue) basis is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed. In addition, for any such taxes that are reported on a gross basis, an entity should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented if those amounts are significant. The provisions of EITF 06-3 should be applied to financial reports for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2006, with earlier adoption permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of EITF 06-3 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements” (“SAB 108”), to address diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements. SAB 108 requires that we quantify misstatements based on their impact on each of our financial statements and related disclosures. The adoption of SAB 108 has not had a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations; however, we recorded an adjustment totaling $1.2 million, which resulted in a reduction to revenue and an offsetting increase to deferred installation revenue, a liability account. This adjustment relates to how we previously accounted for individual customer installation charges that were less than $1,000. Previously, we recognized revenue on customer installation charges less than $1,000 upfront rather than ratably over the longer of the term of the contract or expected customer relationship. We concluded that this cumulative charge was not material to any previously-reported historical period or the current fiscal year. As such, this cumulative charge representing the remaining deferred obligation totaling $1.2 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006 and is included in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 within our results from operations, versus restating prior periods or as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the current year. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS No. 159”). SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure, on an 54 Table of Contents instrument-by-instrument basis, many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk The following discussion about market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent we are exposed to fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity. In the past, we have employed foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging certain specifically identified net currency exposures, however, there were no forward contracts in effect at December 31, 2006. The use of these financial instruments was intended to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, but does not eliminate such risks. We may decide to employ such contracts again in the future. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. All of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale and are therefore recorded at fair market value on our consolidated balance sheet with the unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income or loss. The fair market value of our marketable securities could be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, but we do not believe such impact would be material. Securities with longer maturities are subject to a greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities and as of December 31, 2006 our portfolio maturity was relatively short. If current interest rates were to increase or decrease by 10% from their position as of December 31, 2006, the fair market value of our investment portfolio could increase or decrease by approximately $262,000. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates from their position as of December 31, 2006 would furthermore not have a material impact on our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of the majority of our debt obligations. However, the interest expense associated with our $75.0 million revolving credit line, which bears interest at floating rates, plus applicable margins, based on either the prime rate or LIBOR, could be affected. Accordingly, any borrowings from our $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line are subject to interest rate risk. Assuming $75.0 million was outstanding under the $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line, for every 100 basis point change in interest rates, our interest expense could increase or decrease by $750,000. The fair market value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate changes may affect the fair market value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair market value of our convertible subordinated debentures is based on quoted market prices. The estimated fair value of our convertible subordinated debentures as of December 31, 2006 was approximately $169.4 million versus approximately $98.9 million as of December 31, 2005. Foreign Currency Risk The majority of our recognized revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, generated mostly from customers in the U.S. However, approximately 14% of our revenues and 13% of our costs are in the Asia-Pacific region, and a 55 Table of Contents large portion of those revenues and costs are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Singapore dollar, Japanese yen and Hong Kong and Australian dollars. As a result, our operating results and cash flows are impacted by currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. Going forward, we expect that approximately 13-15% of our revenues and costs will continue to be generated and incurred in the Asia-Pacific region in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, we are currently undergoing an expansion of our IBX center in the Tokyo, Japan metro area and have announced our plans to expand our IBX center in Singapore. As a result, we are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our international expansions. To the extent we are paying contractors in foreign currencies, our expansions could cost more than anticipated from declines in the U.S dollar relative to foreign currencies. Furthermore, to the extent that our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our services less competitive in the international markets. Although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations, and when appropriate, may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations, there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future. Commodity Price Risk Certain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of price changes are electricity and supplies and equipment used in our IBX centers. We are closely monitoring the cost of electricity at all of our locations. In addition, as we now intend to start building new, “greenfield” IBX centers, we will be subject to commodity price risk for building materials related to the construction of these IBX centers, such as steel and copper. In addition, the lead-time to procure certain pieces of equipment is substantial, such as generators. Any delays in procuring the necessary pieces of equipment for the construction of our IBX centers could delay the anticipated openings of these new IBX centers and, as a result, increase the cost of these projects. We do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk.",2023-12-30 20:27:56.430762

Overview Equinix provides network neutral colocation, interconnection and managed services to enterprises, content companies, systems integrators and the world’s largest network providers. On September 14, 2007, we completed the acquisition of IXEurope Plc, or IXEurope, headquartered in London, U.K., whereby IXEurope became our wholly-owned subsidiary. We refer to this transaction as the IXEurope acquisition. IXEurope, a similar business to ours, operated network neutral data centers in the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Switzerland and provided us with an immediate entry into the European data center market, supplementing our existing U.S. and Asia-Pacific operations. As of December 31, 2007, we operate IBX centers in the Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. metro areas in the United States, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and Japan in the Asia-Pacific region, and the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Switzerland in the Europe region. In February 2008, we completed the acquisition of Virtu Secure Webservices B.V. based in the Netherlands (see “Recent Developments” below). Direct interconnection to our aggregation of networks, which serve more than 90% of the world’s Internet routes, allows our customers to increase performance while significantly reducing costs. Based on our network neutral model and the quality of our IBX centers, we believe we have established a critical mass of customers. As more customers locate in our IBX centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to do so as well to gain the full economic and performance benefits of direct interconnection. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a “network effect” of customer adoption. Our interconnection services enable scalable, reliable and cost-effective interconnection and traffic exchange thus lowering overall cost and increasing flexibility. Our focused business model is based on our critical mass of customers and the resulting network effect. This critical mass and the resulting network effect, combined with our strong financial position, continue to drive new customer growth and bookings. Historically, our market has been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled their telecommunications products and services with their colocation offerings. A number of these telecommunications carriers have eliminated or reduced their colocation footprint to focus on their core businesses. In 2003, as an example, one major telecommunications company, Sprint, announced its plans to exit the colocation and hosting market in order to focus on its core service offerings, while another telecommunications company, Cable & Wireless Plc, sold its U.S. assets to another telecommunications company, Savvis Communications Corp, in a bankruptcy auction. In 2005 and 2006, other providers, such as Abovenet and Verio, have selectively sold off certain of their colocation centers. Each of these colocation providers own and operate a network. We do not own or operate a network, yet have greater than 300 networks operating out of our IBX centers. As a result, we are able to offer our customers a substantial choice of networks given our network neutrality thereby allowing our customers to choose from numerous network service providers. We believe this is a distinct and sustainable competitive advantage, especially when the 32 Table of Contents telecommunications industry is experiencing many business challenges and changes as evidenced by the numerous bankruptcies and consolidations within this industry during the past several years. Furthermore, this industry consolidation has constrained the supply of suitable data center space and has created a favorable pricing environment for us. On a consolidated basis, our customer count increased to 1,881 as of December 31, 2007 versus 1,290 as of December 31, 2006, an increase of 46%. This significant increase was primarily due to the IXEurope acquisition in September 2007. Our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus total cabinet space available. Excluding the impact of the IXEurope acquisition, our utilization rate was 58% as of December 31, 2007 and 56% as of December 31, 2006; however, excluding the impact of our recent IBX center openings in the Chicago, New York, Singapore, Tokyo and Washington, D.C. metro areas, our utilization rate would have been 64% as of December 31, 2007. Our utilization rate varies from market to market among our IBX centers in our markets across the U.S., Asia-Pacific and Europe. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of draw our customers take from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain of our high power demand customers. This increased power consumption has driven the requirement to build out our new IBX centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX centers. We could face power limitations in our centers even though we may have additional physical capacity available within a specific IBX center. This could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows. As a result of these power limitations in our IBX centers that were opened before 2007, the maximum utilization rate that we expect to achieve for most IBX centers until we consider an IBX center full or sold-out is approximately 75-80% depending on the building configurations. Due to these power limitations, commencing with the first quarter of 2007, we began to track the utilization of our centers on a net sellable cabinet capacity basis. Therefore, our utilization rate as of December 31, 2007 on a net sellable cabinet capacity basis, excluding the impact of the IXEurope acquisition, was 73% versus the 58% noted above under our previous utilization rate methodology, which does not factor in these power limitations. Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and service offerings, such as our 2005 expansions in the Chicago, Los Angeles and Silicon Valley metro area markets, our 2006 expansions in the Chicago, New York, Tokyo, Japan, and Washington, D.C. metro area markets, which opened in 2007, and our 2007 Los Angeles and San Jose property acquisitions and expansions in the Los Angeles, Silicon Valley, Singapore and Washington, D.C. metro area markets, as well as the IXEurope acquisition. However, we will continue to be very selective with any similar opportunities. As was the case with these recent expansions in our existing markets in the Chicago, Los Angeles, Silicon Valley, Singapore, Tokyo and Washington, D.C. metro area markets or our expansion in new markets, such as Europe with the IXEurope acquisition, our expansion criteria will be dependent on demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, capacity availability in current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to break-even and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. Dependent on the particular deal, these acquisitions may require upfront cash payments and additional capital expenditures or may be funded through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to Equinix standards. Property expansion may be in the form of a purchase of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant. Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation, interconnection and managed infrastructure services. We consider these services recurring as our customers are billed on a fixed and recurring 33 Table of Contents basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues are a significant component of our total revenues, comprising greater than 90% of our total revenues. Over the past few years, greater than half of our then existing customers order new services in any given quarter representing greater than half of the new orders received in each quarter. Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer’s initial deployment and professional services that we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring as they are billed typically once and only upon completion of the installation or professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. As a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future. The largest cost components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX centers, utility costs, including electricity and bandwidth, IBX employees’ salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, supplies and equipment and security services. A substantial majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we add or open new IBX centers. However, there are certain costs, which are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. We expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will increase in the future on a per unit or fixed basis in addition to on a customer growth or variable basis. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months as compared to other times of the year. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees, and other general corporate expenses such as our corporate headquarters office lease and some depreciation expense. Recent Developments In January 2007, we entered into a conditional purchase agreement to purchase the building and property where our original Silicon Valley IBX center is located for $65.2 million, including closing costs, which was paid in full in a cash transaction during July 2007 following an initial $6.5 million cash deposit paid in January 2007. Furthermore, in August 2007, we purchased an adjacent piece of land for $6.3 million, including closing costs, for potential future expansion. We refer to these transactions as the Silicon Valley property acquisition. In February 2007, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries obtained a loan of up to $110.0 million to finance up to 60% of the development and construction costs of our Chicago metro area IBX expansion project. We refer to this transaction as the Chicago IBX financing. We periodically receive advances of funds in conjunction with costs incurred for the construction of our Chicago metro area IBX expansion project, which we refer to as our loan payable. As of December 31, 2007, we had received advances totaling $105.6 million. As a result, up to $4.4 million remained available for borrowing from the Chicago IBX financing and is expected to be borrowed during the first quarter of 2008. The loan payable has a maturity date of January 31, 2010, with options to extend for up to an additional two years, in one-year increments, upon satisfaction of certain extension conditions. The loan payable bears interest at a floating rate (one, three or six month LIBOR plus 2.75%) with interest payable monthly, which commenced March 1, 2007. In February 2008, we received additional advances totaling $1.7 million, bringing the cumulative loan payable to date to $107.3 million with an approximate interest rate of 6.08% per annum. In March and July 2007, we entered into long-term leases for new space in the same building in which our existing Singapore IBX center is located. Minimum payments under these leases, which qualify as operating 34 Table of Contents leases, totaled 5.0 million Singapore dollars (approximately $3.5 million as translated using effective exchange rates at December 31, 2007) in cumulative lease payments with monthly payments commencing in the third quarter of 2007. We are building out this new space in multiple phases and plan to invest approximately $16.2 million in total, of which approximately $15.5 million was incurred as of December 31, 2007. We refer to this project as the Singapore IBX expansion project. The first phase of the Singapore IBX expansion project was opened for customers in the third quarter of 2007; the second and third phases of this project are expected to open during the first quarter and fourth quarter, respectively, of 2008. In March 2007, we extended an offer of employment to Stephen M. Smith to serve as our Chief Executive Officer and President. Mr. Smith commenced his employment with us on April 2, 2007. In March 2007, we entered into agreements with certain holders of our convertible subordinated debentures due February 15, 2024, pursuant to which we agreed to exchange an aggregate of 1.4 million newly issued shares of our common stock for such holders’ $54.0 million of $86.3 million principal amount of the convertible subordinated debentures. The number of shares of common stock issued equaled the amount issuable upon conversion of the convertible subordinated debentures in accordance with their original terms. In addition, each holder received cash consideration equal to accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date totaling $110,000, as well as the present value of future interest due through February 15, 2009 and an incremental fee, totaling $3.4 million, which was recorded as loss on conversion of debt during the three months ended March 31, 2007. In March 2007, we announced our intention to build out a new IBX center within the Ashburn campus, which will be the fifth IBX center in the Washington, D.C. metro area, in order to further expand our existing Washington, D.C metro area IBX center. We refer to this project as the Washington, D.C. metro area IBX expansion project. We plan to spend approximately $78.0 million for the Washington, D.C. metro area IBX expansion project, of which approximately $20.0 million was incurred as of December 31, 2007. We expect to open this IBX center for customers during the second quarter of 2008. In March 2007, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.50% convertible subordinated notes due 2012. The initial conversion rate is 8.9259 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. This represents an initial conversion price of approximately $112.03 per share of common stock or 2.2 million shares of our common stock. Upon conversion, holders will receive, at our election, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. We have used or intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the funding of our expansion activities and working capital requirements. We refer to this transaction as the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes offering. In June 2007, we purchased a new property, comprised of land and an empty building, located in El Segundo, California, for $49.1 million, including closing costs, which we paid in full in a cash transaction during June 2007. We refer to this project as the Los Angeles metro area IBX expansion project. We plan to spend approximately $110.0 million for the Los Angeles metro area IBX expansion project, of which $8.2 million was incurred as of December 31, 2007. We expect to open this IBX center for customers during the fourth quarter of 2008. In June 2007, we announced our plan to invest approximately $41.0 million on one of our existing IBX centers in the Silicon Valley metro area, of which approximately $25.3 million was incurred as of December 31, 2007. We refer to this project as the Silicon Valley metro area IBX expansion project. We expect to open this IBX center for customers during the second quarter of 2008. In July 2007, Christopher Paisley was elected to our board of directors and our audit committee. Mr. Paisley serves as the audit committee’s chair and as its financial expert. In August 2007, our two wholly-owned subsidiaries, located in Singapore and Tokyo, Japan, entered into an approximately $40.0 million multi-currency credit facility agreement. We refer to this transaction as the Asia- Pacific financing. The Asia-Pacific financing has a four-year term that allows these two subsidiaries to borrow up 35 Table of Contents to 23.0 million Singapore dollars and 2.9 billion Japanese yen, respectively, during the first 12-month period with repayment to occur over the remaining three years in 12 equal quarterly installments. Amounts undrawn at the end of the first 12-month period shall be cancelled. The Asia-Pacific financing has a commitment fee of 0.3% on unutilized amounts during the 12-month draw period and bears interest at a floating rate (the relevant three-month local cost of funds for Singapore and Japan), as applicable, plus 1.85%-2.50% depending on the ratio of our senior indebtedness to our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, with interest payable quarterly. The Asia-Pacific financing may be used by these two subsidiaries to fund capital expenditures on leasehold improvements, equipment, and other installation costs related to expansion plans in Singapore and Tokyo. The Asia-Pacific financing is guaranteed by the parent company, is secured by the assets of these two subsidiaries, including a pledge of their shares, and has several financial covenants, with which we must comply quarterly. As of December 31, 2007, we had borrowed 18.3 million Singapore dollars at an initial interest rate per annum of 4.66% and 1.5 billion Japanese yen at an initial interest rate per annum of 2.69%. Collectively the amounts borrowed equal to approximately $25.9 million leaving approximately $14.1 million remaining to borrow under the Asia-Pacific financing. In January 2008, the Asia-Pacific financing was amended to allow our subsidiary in Australia to borrow up to 32.0 million Australian dollars under the same general terms described above. This amendment increased the Asia-Pacific financing to approximately $68.0 million. On September 14, 2007, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours purchased the entire issued and to be issued share capital of IXEurope, a publicly-held company headquartered in London, U.K. Under the final terms of the IXEurope acquisition, IXEurope shareholders received 140 British pence in cash for each IXEurope share. The purchase price, including direct transaction costs, totaled 271.1 million British pounds or $549.2 million. The IXEurope acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 141, “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141”). In September 2007, we closed an offering of 4.2 million shares of our common stock at $84.05 per share (the last reported sale price of our common stock on September 20, 2007). We refer to this transaction as the common stock offering. We received total proceeds of $339.9 million, net of the underwriting discount and other offering expenses. In September 2007, we issued $396.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.00% convertible subordinated notes due 2014. The initial conversion rate is 7.436 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. This represents an initial conversion price of approximately $134.48 per share of common stock or 2.9 million shares of our common stock. We refer to this transaction as the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes offering. In October 2007, we amended certain provisions of the $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line which primarily related to the modification of certain financial covenants as a result of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes offering. In October 2007, we entered into a long-term lease for new space in the same building in which our Paris Saint Denis IBX center is located in order to further expand our IBX operations in this location. Minimum payments under this lease, which qualifies as an operating lease, total 5.5 million Euros (approximately $8.0 million as translated using effective exchange rates at December 31, 2007) in cumulative lease payments with monthly payments commencing in the first quarter of 2008. We intend to invest approximately $17.0 million to build out this new IBX center, of which approximately $1.6 million was incurred as of December 31, 2007. We intend to open this IBX center for customer availability during the second quarter of 2008. In November 2007, we entered into a long-term lease for new space in the same building in which our existing Hong Kong IBX center is located. Minimum payments under this lease, which qualifies as an operating lease, totaled 81.0 million Hong Kong dollars (approximately $10.4 million as translated using effective exchange rates at December 31, 2007) in cumulative lease payments with monthly payments, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2007. We intend to invest approximately $17.0 million commencing in the first quarter of 2008. We intend to open this IBX center for customer availability during the third quarter of 2008. 36 Table of Contents In December 2007, we sold our Equinix mail service offering, which is referred to as EMS, located in Singapore for cash gross proceeds of $1.7 million in a related party transaction. We refer to this transaction as the EMS sale. EMS was a service offering unique to Singapore and was acquired by us in our acquisition of i-STT Pte Ltd on December 31, 2002; however, it was not considered a core service offering for us. EMS was not an asset held for sale prior to this. The EMS sale enables us to focus on our core IBX service offerings in Singapore. We accounted for the EMS sale under the provisions of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” which resulted in a gain of $1.3 million. In January 2008, we entered into a long-term lease for a new building located on the same campus as our existing Sydney IBX center and at the same time terminated the existing lease for our original Sydney IBX center by incorporating it into the new lease and extended the original lease term for an additional seven years in a single, lease agreement for both buildings. Minimum payments under this lease, incremental to the previous lease, totaled 12.2 million Australian dollars (approximately $10.7 million as translated using effective exchange rates at December 31, 2007) in cumulative lease payments with monthly payments that commenced in January 2008. We intend to invest approximately $29.5 million commencing in the first quarter of 2008 to build out this new IBX center. We intend to open this IBX center for customer availability during the fourth quarter of 2008. In January and February 2008, we received additional advances related to the European financing, acquired in connection with the IXEurope acquisition, totaling 7.7 million British pounds or approximately $15.2 million, bringing the cumulative loan payable to date to 49.7 million British pounds or approximately $98.8 million with an approximate blended interest rate of 7.39% per annum. As a result, the amount available to borrow from the European financing totals 32.3 million British pounds or approximately $64.2 million. In February 2008, we acquired Virtu Secure Webservices B.V., which is referred to as Virtu, a provider of network-neutral data center services in the Netherlands, for a cash payment of 15.0 million Euros or $22.9 million, excluding closing costs. We refer to this transaction as the Virtu acquisition. Under the terms of the Virtu acquisition, we may also pay some additional future contingent consideration, which will be payable in the form of up to 20,000 shares of our common stock and cash of up to 1.5 million euros, contingent upon meeting certain pre-determined future annual operating targets for 2008 to 2011. Virtu, a similar business to ours, operates data centers in the Netherlands, supplementing our existing European operations recently acquired as a result of the IXEurope acquisition. The combined company will operate under the Equinix name and the current Virtu management team will join our existing European management team in running our operations in the Netherlands. The Virtu acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS 141. We plan to incur additional capital expenditures of approximately $26.0 million to complete the build-out of the IBX center in Amsterdam currently under construction by Virtu. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: • Accounting for business combinations; • Accounting for stock-based compensation; 37 Table of Contents • Accounting for restructuring charges; and • Accounting for income taxes. Accounting for Business Combinations. We account for business combinations in accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations”, such as the IXEurope acquisition in September 2007. In accordance with business combination accounting, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Such allocations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable. These estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the tangible and intangible assets include but are not limited to: appraised values of property and equipment, future expected cash flows from customer contracts; the fair value of leases acquired, the acquired company’s brand and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio, if any; and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies. If, during the purchase price allocation period, we are able to determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency, we will include that amount in the purchase price allocation. If, as of the end of the purchase price allocation period, we are unable to determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency, we will evaluate whether to include an amount in the purchase price allocation based on whether it is probable a liability had been incurred and whether an amount can be reasonably estimated. With the exception of unresolved tax matters, after the end of the purchase price allocation period, any adjustment to amounts recorded for a pre-acquisition contingency will be included in our operating results in the period in which the adjustment is determined. We note that accounting for business combinations will be impacted by SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”, which we are adopting in 2008 (with certain elements deferred until 2009 as provided in FSP FAS 157-2), and SFAS No. 141(R), “Business Combinations”, which replaces SFAS No. 141, beginning in 2009. We will apply these new accounting pronouncements accordingly for all future business combinations as appropriate. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” and related pronouncements (“SFAS 123(R)”). We recorded stock-based compensation expense of $42.7 million and $30.8 million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. The fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares was valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model while the fair value of our restricted stock grants with a market price condition was valued using a Monte Carlo simulation option-pricing model. The determination of the fair value of equity awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and highly subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors or expected term, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. We record stock-based compensation expense on stock awards expected to vest during the period net of estimated forfeitures. The estimated forfeitures on unvested stock awards are assessed based on our historical forfeiture activity and our expectations about future employee turnover, and these rates are subject to revision in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Higher forfeitures will result in lower stock-based compensation expense while lower forfeiture rates will result in higher stock-based compensation expense. 38 Table of Contents We estimate the expected volatility by using the average historical volatility of our common stock that we believe is the best representative of the future volatility. The expected term of options used is calculated by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option, as illustrated in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB 107”). In 2008, we will apply the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110 (“SAB 110”) in connection with the method of expected term calculation. The risk-free interest rate used is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on our equity awards. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, therefore, the expected dividend rate used is zero. During the year ended December 31, 2007, stock options granted to employees had a total fair value of $42.6 million compared to $39.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2006. Changes in assumptions (as well as different option-pricing models used for estimating the fair value of stock awards) can significantly affect our future period expense. Based on our analysis, the table below presents the possible impact of increases or decreases of individual variables (representing increases and decreases of 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%) in the assumptions to the fair value of employee stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands): Expected volatility Risk-free interest rate Expected life Weighted average rate Increase/(decrease)in fairvalue(%) (1)Increase/(decrease)in totalexpense Weightedaveragerate Increase/(decrease)in fairvalue(%) (1)Increase/(decrease)in totalexpense Weightedaveragelife Increase/(decrease)in fairvalue(%) (1)Increase/(decrease)in totalexpense 88% 25.27 % $ 10,765 6.35 % 3.62 % $ 1,540 6.38 15.30 % $ 6,517 81% 19.45 % 8,287 5.90 % 2.72 % 1,158 5.93 11.86 % 5,052 75% 13.29 % 5,663 5.44 % 1.82 % 774 5.47 8.18 % 3,485 69% 6.80 % 2,898 4.99 % 0.91 % 388 5.02 4.24 % 1,806 63%(2) 4.54 %(2) 4.56 (2) 56% (7.10 )% (3,024 ) 4.08 % (0.92 )% (390 ) 4.10 (4.58 )% (1,950 ) 50% (14.46 )% (6,161 ) 3.63 % (1.84 )% (782 ) 3.65 (9.55 )% (4,066 ) 44% (22.06 )% (9,397 ) 3.18 % (2.76 )% (1,176 ) 3.19 (14.97 )% (6,376 ) 38% (29.85 )% (12,713 ) 2.72 % (3.69 )% (1,571 ) 2.74 (20.94 )% (8,919 ) (1) Increase/decrease in total expense over the entire vesting period of the individual equity awards is calculated based on percentage increase/decrease in fair value to the total fair value of $42.6 million of our employee stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2007, of which $7.0 million, net of estimated forfeitures, was amortized during the year then ended. (2) Variables used in calculating the fair value of our employee stock options granted for the year ended December 31, 2007. The table above shows that changes in expected volatility present the most significant impact to the increases and decreases in stock-based compensation expense compared to changes in other variables. Assuming other variables remained unchanged, had the expected volatility increased by 40%, our stock-based compensation expense recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, for the year ended December 31, 2007 would have been approximately $1.8 million higher than the reported stock-based compensation expense (the above table demonstrates potential changes to the total value of equity awards, which is generally amortized over four years). Had the expected volatility decreased by 40%, our stock-based compensation expense recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, for the year ended December 31, 2007 would have been approximately $2.2 million lower than the reported stock-based compensation expense. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. The guidance in SFAS 123(R), SAB 107 and SAB 110 is relatively new. The application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time. There are significant differences among 39 Table of Contents valuation models, and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future. This may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock-based payments. It may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models, methods and assumptions. Accounting for Restructuring Charges. We account for restructuring activities in accordance with SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” We recorded restructuring charges totaling $33.8 million and $17.7 million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 for the exit of certain leases. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 146, we had to estimate the future cash payments required to exit these leases, net of any estimated sublease income and expense, through the remainder of these lease terms and then determine the present value of such future cash flows to record the appropriate restructuring charges. Subsequent to the period in which the initial restructuring charge was taken, we record accretion expense to accrete our accrued restructuring liabilities up to an amount equal to the total estimated future cash payments necessary to complete the exit of these leases. SFAS No. 146 requires us to assume sublease income for these leases and two of these leases extend through 2015. Furthermore, one of these leases currently continues to be unoccupied as it remains a difficult property to market. Therefore, significant and inherently uncertain sublease assumptions were required at the time we recorded these restructuring charges. If we are unable to generate sublease income in the same amount that was projected at the time we recorded the initial restructuring charges, we will need to revise these restructuring charges accordingly. For example, during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we recorded additional restructuring charges of $407,000 and $1.5 million, respectively, as a result of revised sublease assumptions related to the 2004 restructuring charge. We expect that in the future additional restructuring charge adjustments will recur as we periodically adjust these sublease assumptions to reflect current facts and circumstances. As we continue to assess expansion opportunities, we may decide to use these spaces. If we do, we would have to reverse some of the restructuring charges originally recorded as a result of our prior decision to exit the leases. Accounting for Income Taxes. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and whether deferred tax assets will be recoverable in full or in part. We calculate our tax provision in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Our estimates and assumptions used in the provision may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified and settled. When it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carry-forwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are not recoverable. The valuation allowance is determined pursuant to SFAS No. 109 which requires the assessment of both positive and negative evidence. Such assessment should be performed on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. We have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in the U.S. and we intend to maintain the same position for fiscal 2008 based on the assessment of the positive and negative evidence present. As a result of the IXEurope acquisition, we entered into various new jurisdictions in Europe and recorded a significant amount of deferred tax liabilities in certain European jurisdictions attributable to the identifiable intangibles and fixed assets fair value step-up with an increase to goodwill. We believe a full valuation allowance position is necessary in all of our foreign jurisdictions in which there are net deferred tax assets due to the history of losses in these foreign jurisdictions, other than Singapore and Switzerland. In addition, as evidenced by the issuance of FIN 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with the inherent uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions. We are also subject to examinations by various taxing authorities. We believe we have adequately reserved in our financial statements for potential tax liabilities including penalties and interest. If events occur and the payment of the reserved tax liability ultimately proves to be unnecessary, we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period when we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. If, however, it is more likely than not that a reserved liability proves to be less than the ultimate assessment including penalties and interest, a further charge to expense would become necessary. 40 Table of Contents Results of Operations Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 include the operations of IXEurope from September 14, 2007 to December 31, 2007 as a result of the IXEurope acquisition, which closed on September 14, 2007. As a result, only 109 days of operations are reported from our Europe operations. Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were split between the following revenue classifications (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2007 % 2006 % Recurring revenues $ 399,656 95 % $ 273,160 95 % Non-recurring revenues: 19,786 5 % 13,755 5 % Total revenues $ 419,442 100 % $ 286,915 100 % Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were geographically comprised of the following (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2007 % 2006 % U.S. revenues $ 324,878 77 % $ 246,066 86 % Asia-Pacific revenues 57,074 14 % 40,849 14 % Europe revenues 37,490 9 % — — Total revenues $ 419,442 100 % $ 286,915 100 % We recognized revenues of $419.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to revenues of $286.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, a 46% increase. We analyze our business geographically between the U.S., Asia-Pacific and Europe as further discussed below. U.S. Revenues. We recognized U.S. revenues of $324.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $246.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. U.S. revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $311.8 million and $235.4 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, a 32% increase. The period over period growth in recurring revenues was primarily the result of an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers acquired during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX centers, as well as selective price increases in each of our IBX markets. Most notably, we recorded $15.3 million of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2007 from our newly opened IBX centers in the Chicago, New York and Washington, D.C. metro areas. In addition, we recorded a net adjustment of $775,000 to our U.S. recurring revenues as a result of correcting billing errors attributable to prior periods, the net impact of which increased our U.S. recurring revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007. We concluded that the cumulative credit to recurring revenues, totaling $775,000, was not material to any previously-reported historical periods and expected results of operations for the current fiscal year. As such, this cumulative credit was recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2007 and is included in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007. We expect our U.S. recurring revenues, particularly from colocation and interconnection services, to continue to remain our most significant source of revenue for the foreseeable future. U.S. revenues also consisted of non-recurring revenues of $13.1 million and $10.7 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a reduction of $1.2 million to our non-recurring installation revenues. 41 Table of Contents In December 2006, we sold our Honolulu IBX center and, as a result, we no longer recognize revenues from this IBX center. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized $2.3 million of revenue from our Honolulu IBX center, or less than 1% of our total U.S. revenues. Asia-Pacific Revenues. We recognized Asia-Pacific revenues of $57.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $40.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, a 40% increase. Asia-Pacific revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $52.5 million and $37.8 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, primarily from colocation and managed infrastructure services. Our Asia-Pacific colocation revenues are similar to the revenues that we generate from our U.S. IBX centers; however, our Singapore IBX center had additional managed infrastructure service revenue, such as mail service (referred to as EMS) and managed platform solutions, which we do not currently offer in any other IBX center location. In December 2007, the EMS service offering was sold and, as a result, subsequent to the sale, we no longer recognize revenue from the EMS service offering. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized $3,473,000 of revenue from the EMS service offering or less than 7% of our total Asia-Pacific revenues. In addition, Asia-Pacific revenues consisted of non-recurring revenues of $4.6 million and $3.0 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. Asia-Pacific revenues are generated from our IBXs in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo, with Singapore representing approximately 35% and 39%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. The growth in our Asia-Pacific revenues is primarily the result of an increase in the customer base in this region during the past year, particularly in Hong Kong, Sydney and Tokyo. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded $1.7 million of revenues from our new IBX center in Tokyo, which we acquired in December 2006, and $1.2 million from our new IBX center in Singapore. We expect that our Asia-Pacific revenues will continue to grow; although this growth will be somewhat offset by the loss of revenue as a result of the EMS sale. Europe Revenues. As a result of the IXEurope acquisition, we recognized revenues of $37.5 million from Europe during the year ended December 31, 2007. We expect our Europe revenues to grow in future periods, both organically and as a result of expansion activity currently taking place in Frankfurt, London and Paris, as well as due to the Virtu acquisition. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues was $263.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $188.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, a 40% increase. U.S. Cost of Revenues. U.S. cost of revenues was $198.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $165.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. U.S. cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 included (i) $73.8 million of depreciation and amortization expense, (ii) $3.1 million of accretion expense comprised of our asset retirement obligations and restructuring charges for certain leasehold interests recorded in 2004 and 2005 as we accrete the related liabilities to the total estimated future cash payments needed and (iii) $3.5 million of stock-based compensation. U.S. cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 included (i) $65.7 million of depreciation and amortization expense, (ii) $3.5 million of accretion expense comprised of our asset retirement obligations and restructuring charges for certain leasehold interests recorded in 2004 and 2005 as we accrete the related liabilities to the total estimated future cash payments needed and (iii) $2.7 million of stock-based compensation. Our U.S. cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 also included $9.5 million of additional operating costs not incurred in the prior year associated with the recently opened IBX centers in the Chicago, New York and Washington, D.C. metro areas. Excluding depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation and the costs associated with operating our new IBX centers, U.S. cost of revenues increased period over period to $96.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $81.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, a 19% increase. This increase was primarily the result of higher compensation costs and increasing utility costs in line with increasing customer installations and revenues attributed to customer growth. We continue to anticipate that our U.S. cost of revenues will increase in the foreseeable future to the extent that the occupancy levels in our U.S. IBX centers increase and as newly-opened IBX centers in the Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. metro areas commence operations more fully in 2008. However, a portion of our expected 42 Table of Contents increase in U.S. cost of revenues will be partially offset by a reduction in rent expense as a result of our Silicon Valley property acquisition. We expect that this savings in rent expense will be approximately $2.0 million annually; however part of the rent savings will be offset by increases in depreciation and property tax expense. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was $35.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 included $9.5 million and $3.8 million, respectively, of depreciation and amortization expense. Our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 also included $3.7 million of additional operating costs not incurred in the prior year associated with the recently opened IBX centers in Singapore and Tokyo metro areas. Excluding depreciation, stock-based compensation and the costs associated with operating our new IBX centers, Asia-Pacific cost of revenues increased period over period to $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, a 13% increase. This increase was primarily the result of higher compensation costs and increasing utility and bandwidth costs in line with increasing customer installations and revenues attributed to this customer growth. We anticipate that our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues will increase in the foreseeable future in connection with overall revenue growth and our expansion in the Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo metro areas. Europe Cost of Revenues. As a result of the IXEurope acquisition, we incurred additional cost of revenues of $30.2 million from our Europe operations during the year ended December 31, 2007. Europe cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $7.7 million of depreciation and amortization expense. Our Europe cost of revenues will increase in future periods, both organically and as a result of expansion activity currently taking place in Frankfurt, London and Paris, as well as due to the Virtu acquisition. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased to $40.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. U.S. Sales and Marketing Expenses. U.S. sales and marketing expenses increased to $31.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Included in U.S. sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $8.2 million and $6.8 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, U.S. sales and marketing expenses increased to $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, a 9% increase. This increase was primarily due to (i) approximately $1.0 million of higher compensation costs, including increases in sales compensation related to strong new customer bookings throughout 2007 and general salary increases and bonuses for our marketing staff and non-commissioned sales staff and (ii) approximately $509,000 of higher travel costs related to our customer and revenue growth. We expect U.S. sales and marketing spending to increase as we continue to grow our business and invest in various branding initiatives. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses increased to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Excluding stock-based compensation, Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses were $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, a 45% increase. This increase was primarily due to general salary increases and sales compensation over the prior period associated with the overall growth in this region. We expect that our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses will continue to grow in the foreseeable future. Europe Sales and Marketing Expenses. As a result of the IXEurope acquisition, we incurred additional sales and marketing expenses of $3.0 million from our Europe operations during the year ended December 31, 2007. Included in Europe sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1.8 million of intangible asset amortization and stock-based compensation expense. Our Europe sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase in future periods as a result of our effort to drive increased revenue growth in this region, both organic and expansion-related. 43 Table of Contents General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased to $105.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $72.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. U.S. General and Administrative Expenses. U.S. general and administrative expenses increased to $83.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $60.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Included in U.S. general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $24.9 million of stock-based compensation expense and $6.9 million of depreciation expense. Included in U.S. general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $17.7 million of stock-based compensation expense and $3.0 million of depreciation expense. Excluding stock-based compensation expense and depreciation expense, U.S. general and administrative expenses increased to $51.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $39.9 million for the same period last year, a 29% increase. This increase was primarily due to (i) approximately $6.2 million of higher cash compensation costs, including increases in general salary and benefits, bonuses and headcount growth (220 U.S. general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2007 versus 175 as of December 31, 2006), (ii) an increase in professional fees of approximately $1.8 million due to an increase in various consulting projects in connection with our growth strategies and (iii) an increase in travel and training expenses of approximately $811,000. Going forward, we expect U.S. general and administrative spending to increase as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth. Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses increased to $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Included in Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $4.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation. Excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation, Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses increased to $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to $8.8 million for the same period last year, a 15% increase. This increase was primarily due to higher compensation costs, including general salary increases and bonuses. We expect that our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses will experience some growth in the foreseeable future. Europe General and Administrative Expenses. As a result of the IXEurope acquisition, we incurred additional general and administrative expenses of $8.3 million from our Europe operations during the year ended December 31, 2007. Included in Europe general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1.1 million of stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. Our Europe general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in future periods as this region scales to support the anticipated revenue growth in the region and in connection with various integration initiatives related to investments in systems and internal control compliance. Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded an additional restructuring charge of $407,000 as a result of revised sublease assumptions for our excess space lease in the Los Angeles metro area as a result of new information becoming available. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded an additional restructuring charge of $1.5 million as a result of revised sublease assumptions on two of our excess space leases in the New York and Los Angeles metro areas as a result of new information becoming available. The original restructuring charge for these two leases was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 and totaled $17.7 million. We are contractually committed to these two leases through 2015. Gains on Asset Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a $1.3 million gain in connection with the EMS sale, which we sold for $1.7 million in gross cash proceeds. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a $9.6 million gain in connection with the sale of our Honolulu IBX center. We sold this IBX center for $9.8 million in gross cash proceeds. Interest Income. Interest income increased to $15.4 million from $6.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Interest income increased due to higher invested balances during these periods, as well as higher yields on those balances due to increased interest rates. The average annualized 44 Table of Contents yield for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 5.08% versus 4.53% for the year ended December 31, 2006. We expect our interest income to decrease for the foreseeable future due to the utilization of our cash to finance our expansion activities and decreasing interest rates. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $27.3 million from $14.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to new financings entered into during 2006 and 2007: (i) an additional financing of $40.0 million under the Ashburn campus mortgage payable during the three months ended December 31, 2006, which bears interest at 8.0% per annum, (ii) our $110.0 million Chicago IBX financing, which was drawn down during the construction period of the Chicago metro area IBX expansion project, of which $105.6 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2007 with an approximate interest rate of 8.375% per annum, (iii) our $250.0 million 2.50% convertible subordinated notes offering in March 2007, (iv) our approximately $40.0 million Asia-Pacific financing, of which approximately $25.9 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2007 with an approximate blended interest rate of 3.65% per annum, (v) our $396.0 million 3.00% convertible subordinated notes offering in September 2007 and (vi) our approximately $162.9 million European financing, of which $83.5 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2007 with an approximate blended interest rate of 7.74% per annum. This increase was partially offset by the $54.0 million partial conversion of our 2.50% convertible subordinated debentures in March 2007 that resulted in a decrease in interest expense. Although we now have higher debt balances, we are also capitalizing more interest in connection with various construction projects related to our IBX expansion efforts. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we capitalized $7.1 million and $1.6 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. Going forward, we expect to incur higher interest expense as we fully utilize or recognize the full impact of our existing financings to fund our expansion efforts and as we complete expansion efforts and cease to capitalize interest expense. Other Income (Expense). For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded $3.0 million of other income, primarily consisting of a foreign exchange gain of $1.5 million as a result of hedging a portion of the IXEurope acquisition purchase price with forward contracts and a $621,000 foreign exchange gain related to the liquidation of a wholly-owned subsidiary in the Netherlands. As a result, this historical foreign exchange gain of $621,000, accumulated within other comprehensive income associated with this dormant subsidiary, was recognized in our results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $245,000 of other expense, which was primarily attributable to foreign currency losses during the period. Loss on Conversion and Extinguishment of Debt. During the three months ended March 31, 2007, we retired $54.0 million of our convertible subordinated debentures in exchange for approximately 1.4 million newly issued shares of our common stock. As a result, we recorded a $3.4 million loss on debt conversion in accordance with FASB No. 84, “Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt,” due to the inducement fee paid. In September 2007, the senior bridge loan was terminated unused and, as a result, we recorded a $2.5 million loss on debt extinguishment reflecting the immediate write-off of capitalized debt issuance costs to secure the senior bridge loan. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized a total of $5.9 million of loss on debt conversion and extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any loss on conversion or extinguishment of debt in our statements of operations. Income Taxes. During 2007, we recorded $473,000 of income tax expense primarily attributable to our foreign operations. During 2006, we recorded $439,000 of income tax expense primarily representing U.S. alternative minimum tax and a net tax benefit from our operation in Singapore, which resulted from the release of the valuation allowance in the jurisdiction. We have not incurred any significant income tax expense since inception and we do not expect to incur any meaningful income tax expense during 2008. Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle. As a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a reduction of expense totaling $376,000, which is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on our statement of operations for this period. This amount reflects the application of an estimated forfeiture rate to partially vested 45 Table of Contents employee equity awards as of January 1, 2006 that we accounted for under APB 25, which was primarily for restricted stock awards to our executive officers that were granted during the three months ended March 31, 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2007 no cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was recorded in our statement of operations. Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 were split between the following revenue classifications (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2006 % 2005 % Recurring revenues $ 273,160 95 % $ 208,003 94 % Non-recurring revenues: 13,755 5 % 13,054 6 % Total revenues $ 286,915 100 % $ 221,057 100 % Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 were geographically comprised of the following (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2006 % 2005 % U.S. revenues $ 246,066 86 % $ 191,390 87 % Asia-Pacific revenues 40,849 14 % 29,667 13 % Total revenues $ 286,915 100 % $ 221,057 100 % We recognized revenues of $286.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to revenues of $221.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a 30% increase. We analyze our business geographically between the U.S. and Asia-Pacific as further discussed below. U.S. Revenues. We recognized U.S. revenues of $246.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $191.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. U.S. revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $235.4 million and $180.4 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, a 30% increase. The period over period growth in recurring revenues was primarily the result of an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers acquired during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate as discussed above, and selective price increases in each of our IBX markets. Most notably, we recorded $7.9 million of revenues from our new IBX centers in the Chicago, Los Angeles and Silicon Valley metro areas, which opened for business during the year ended December 31, 2006. In addition, U.S. revenues consisted of non-recurring revenues of $10.7 million and $11.0 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Included in U.S. non-recurring revenues are settlement fees of $817,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005. There were no such settlement fees for the year ended December 31, 2006. Offsetting some of this non-recurring revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 were service level credits that we recorded totaling $457,000 that were issued or will be issued to certain of our customers related to two separate power outages in our Chicago and Washington, D.C. metro area IBX centers. There were no significant service level credits recorded in the year ended December 31, 2006. In addition, we recorded a reduction of $1.2 million to our non-recurring installation revenues during the quarter ended December 31, 2006. Excluding settlements and service level credits, U.S. non-recurring revenues, consisting of the recognized portion of deferred installation and professional services, increased 5% period over period, primarily due to strong existing and new customer growth during the year. 46 Table of Contents In December 2006, we sold our Honolulu IBX center and, as a result, subsequent to the sale we no longer recognize revenues from this IBX center. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized $2.3 million of revenue from our Honolulu IBX center or less than 1% of our total U.S. revenues. Asia-Pacific Revenues. We recognized Asia-Pacific revenues of $40.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $29.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a 38% increase. Asia-Pacific revenues consisted of recurring revenues of $37.8 million and $27.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, consisting primarily of colocation and managed infrastructure services. In addition, Asia-Pacific revenues consisted of non-recurring revenues of $3.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Asia-Pacific revenues are generated from Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo, with Singapore representing approximately 39% and 45%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. The growth in our Asia-Pacific revenues is primarily the result of an increase in the customer base in this region during the past year, particularly in Hong Kong, Sydney and Tokyo. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues were $188.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $158.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a 19% increase. U.S. Cost of Revenues. U.S. cost of revenues was $165.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $138.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. U.S. cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 included (i) $65.0 million of depreciation expense, (ii) $3.5 million of accretion expense comprised of our asset retirement obligations and restructuring charges for certain leasehold interests recorded in 2004 and 2005 as we accrete the related liabilities to the total estimated future cash payments needed and (iii) $2.7 million of stock-based compensation as a result of our adoption of SFAS 123(R) effective January 1, 2006. U.S. cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 included (i) $57.1 million of depreciation expense and (ii) $1.9 million of accretion expense comprised of our asset retirement obligations and restructuring charges for certain leasehold interests recorded in 2004 and 2005 as we accrete the related liabilities to the total estimated future cash payments needed. Our U.S. cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 also included $17.7 million of additional operating costs not incurred in the prior year associated with the recently opened IBX centers in the Chicago, Los Angeles and Silicon Valley metro areas (the Chicago and Los Angeles IBX centers opened for business during the three months ended June 30, 2006, and the Silicon Valley IBX center opened for business during the three months ended September 30, 2006). Excluding depreciation, accretion expense, stock-based compensation, amortization expense and the costs associated with operating our new IBX centers, U.S. cost of revenues increased period over period to $81.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $77.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a 4% increase. This increase was primarily the result of increases in (i) utility costs of approximately $6.3 million in line with increasing customer installations and revenues attributed to customer growth, (ii) compensation costs of approximately $2.9 million, including general salary increases and bonuses and headcount growth and (iii) repair and maintenance expenses. This increase was partially offset by a reduction of approximately $7.4 million in rent expense in connection with a property we recorded a restructuring charge for in San Jose in the fourth quarter of 2005 and the purchase of the previously leased Ashburn campus property in October 2005. In December 2006, we sold our Honolulu IBX center. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $1.3 million in costs of revenue for the Honolulu IBX center, representing less than 1% of our total U.S. cost of revenues. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $20.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 included $3.5 million and $3.6 million, respectively, of depreciation and amortization expense. Excluding depreciation, stock-based compensation and non-cash rent expense, Asia-Pacific cost of revenues increased period over period to $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a 15% increase. This increase was primarily the result of increasing utility and bandwidth costs in line with increasing customer installations and revenues attributed to this customer growth. 47 Table of Contents Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased to $32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. U.S. Sales and Marketing Expenses. U.S. sales and marketing expenses increased to $28.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Included in U.S. sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $6.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. The increase in stock-based compensation expense period over period is a result of our adoption of SFAS 123(R) effective January 1, 2006. Excluding stock-based compensation and amortization expense, U.S. sales and marketing expenses increased to $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a 33% increase. This increase was primarily due to (i) approximately $3.9 million of higher compensation costs, including increases in sales compensation related to strong new customer bookings throughout 2006 and general salary increases and bonuses for our marketing staff and non-commissioned sales staff and (ii) approximately $815,000 of higher travel costs related to our customer and revenue growth. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses increased to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Excluding stock-based compensation, Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses were $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 versus $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, a 30% increase. This increase was primarily due to higher compensation costs as a result of the strong revenue growth in this region and an increase in bad debt expense. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased to $72.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $45.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. U.S. General and Administrative Expenses. U.S. general and administrative expenses increased to $60.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $37.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Included in U.S. general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $17.7 million of stock-based compensation expense and $3.0 million of depreciation expense. Included in U.S. general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $6.7 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1.7 million of depreciation expense. The increase in stock-based compensation expense period over period is a result of our adoption of SFAS 123(R) effective January 1, 2006. Excluding stock-based compensation expense and depreciation expense, U.S. general and administrative expenses increased to $39.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $28.9 million for the same period last year, a 38% increase. This increase was primarily due to (i) approximately $4.4 million of higher compensation costs, including general salary increases, bonuses and headcount growth (175 U.S. general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2006 versus 152 as of December 31, 2005), (ii) an increase in professional fees of approximately $5.0 million due to increased legal fees in connection with our legal matters such as the review of our past stock option grants and practices, accounting fees and other consulting projects in connection with our growth strategies and (iii) increases in rent, repair and maintenance expenses in connection with our office expansion in Foster City, California and travel expenses. Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses increased to $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Included in Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2006 were $2.5 million of stock-based compensation as a result of our adoption of SFAS 123(R) effective January 1, 2006. Excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation, Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses increased to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to $7.5 million for the same period last year, a 17% increase. This increase was primarily due to higher compensation costs, including general salary increases and bonuses. Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded an additional restructuring charge of $1.5 million as a result of revised sublease assumptions on two of our excess space leases in the New York and Los Angeles metro areas as a result of new information becoming available. 48 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a restructuring charge of $33.8 million, which we refer to as the 2005 restructuring charge. In light of the availability of fully or partially built-out data centers in the Silicon Valley, including the possibility of expansion in or near some of the four IBX centers we currently have in the Silicon Valley, we made the decision that retaining the approximately 40 acre San Jose ground lease for future expansion was no longer economical. In conjunction with this decision, we entered into an agreement with the landlord of this property for an early termination of the San Jose ground lease whereby we would pay $40.0 million over four years, commencing January 1, 2006, to terminate this lease, which would otherwise require significantly higher cumulative lease payments through 2020. The restructuring charge consisted of (i) a $32.3 million charge representing the present value of our estimated future cash payments to exit this property, which is net of $4.4 million of deferred rent previously accrued for this lease (thereby creating a total restructuring liability of $36.7 million associated with this lease) and (ii) a write-off of property and equipment of $1.5 million representing development costs incurred to date to prepare this land for use. We expect, as a result of this restructuring charge, we will realize annual savings in cost of revenues of approximately $5.6 million. For further detailed information on our restructuring charges, see Note 15 of our “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Gains on Asset Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a $9.6 million gain in connection with the sale of our Honolulu IBX center. Interest Income. Interest income increased to $6.6 million from $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest income increased due to higher invested balances during these periods, as well as higher yields on those balances due to increased interest rates. The average annualized yield for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 4.53% versus 3.32% for the year ended December 31, 2005. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $14.9 million from $8.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to increases in interest expense associated with the new financings entered into during 2006 and 2005: (i) the $9.7 million financing for equipment we purchased in connection with our Chicago IBX acquisition in November 2005, which bears interest at 7.50%; (ii) the $38.1 million financing in connection with our Los Angeles IBX financing in December 2005, which bears interest at 7.75%; and (iii) the $100.0 million mortgage payable, which bears interest at 8.00%, in connection with our Ashburn campus financing, of which $60.0 million was borrowed in December 2005 and the remaining $40.0 million was borrowed in December 2006. This increase was partially offset by the debt conversion activities during the fiscal year 2005 that resulted in a decrease in interest expense. In November 2005, STT Communications converted the remaining 5% of the outstanding 14% convertible secured notes and unpaid interest totaling $2.2 million into 240,578 shares of our preferred stock, which was immediately converted into 240,578 shares of our common stock. Furthermore, in connection with various construction projects related to our IBX expansion efforts during the year ended December 31, 2006, we capitalized $1.6 million of interest expense to construction in progress. We did not capitalize any interest during the year ended December 31, 2005 as no material amounts of interest qualified for capitalization. Other Income (Expense). For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $245,000 of other expense, which was primarily attributable to foreign currency losses during the period. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded $25,000 of other income, which was primarily attributable to foreign currency gains during the period. Income Taxes. During fiscal 2006, we recorded $439,000 of income tax provision primarily representing U.S. alternative minimum tax and a net tax benefit from our operation in Singapore, which resulted from the release of the valuation allowance in the jurisdiction. During fiscal 2005, we recorded $543,000 of income tax provision consisting of U.S. alternative minimum tax and foreign income tax. A valuation allowance is recorded against the net deferred tax assets in all the jurisdictions other than Singapore as management could not conclude, based on the available objective evidence including recurring historical losses, that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets are recoverable in future years. However, management believed that as of December 31, 2006, it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be fully recoverable in Singapore, as the positive evidence present in the jurisdiction was sufficient to overcome the negative evidence. 49 Table of Contents Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle. As a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a reduction of expense totaling $376,000, which is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on our statement of operations for this period. This amount reflects the application of an estimated forfeiture rate to partially vested employee equity awards as of January 1, 2006 that we accounted for under APB 25, which was primarily for restricted stock awards to our executive officers that were granted during the three months ended March 31, 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2007, our total indebtedness was comprised of (i) convertible debt totaling $678.2 million from our convertible subordinated debentures, our 2.50% convertible subordinated notes and our 3.00% convertible subordinated notes as outlined below and (ii) non-convertible debt and financing obligations totaling $427.9 million from our various capital leases, Ashburn campus mortgage payable, Chicago IBX financing, Asia-Pacific financing, European financing, other note payable and other financing obligations as outlined below. We believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities and anticipated cash from financings, to meet our operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2007, we had $383.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. As of December 31, 2007, we had a total of $159.9 million of additional liquidity available to us in the event we need additional cash to fund expansion activities, fund working capital requirements or pursue attractive strategic opportunities that may become available in the future, which was comprised of (i) $4.4 million under the Chicago IBX financing for the Chicago metro area IBX expansion project, (ii) $62.0 million under the $75.0 million Silicon Valley bank revolving credit line, (iii) $14.1 million under the Asia-Pacific financing for expansion projects in Singapore and Tokyo and (iv) $79.4 million under the European financing for general working capital and expansion projects in Europe. In addition, from time to time we assess external financing opportunities, both debt and equity, as alternative sources for financing such activities and opportunities, including any acquisition plans. While we expect that our cash flow from operations will continue to increase, we expect our cash flow used in investing activities, primarily as a result of our expected purchases of property and equipment to complete our announced expansion projects, will also increase and we expect our cash flow used in investing activities to be greater than our cash flows generated from operating activities. Given our limited operating history, additional potential expansion opportunities that we may decide to pursue and other business risks that may cause our operating results to fluctuate, we may not achieve our desired levels of profitability or cash requirements in the future. For further information, refer to “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K above. Sources and Uses of Cash Net cash provided by our operating activities was $120.0 million, $75.4 million and $67.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. This increase was primarily due to improved operating results; however, these improved operating results were offset by growth in accounts receivables and additional restructuring charge payments as a result of our 2005 and 2004 restructuring charges. While our customer collections have remained very strong, as a result of our revenue growth and customer installation activity, our accounts receivables have also grown, impacting the growth of our cash flow from operations. While this increased level of accounts receivables and restructuring charge payments have had an impact on our ability to grow our cash from operating activities, we expect that we will continue to generate cash from our operating activities throughout 2008 and beyond. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.1 billion, $158.5 million and $108.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was primarily the IXEurope acquisition in September 2007 for $541.7 million, the result of the capital expenditures required to bring our recently announced and current IBX expansion projects to Equinix standards, and to support our growing customer base, the purchase of our San Jose IBX property and an adjacent 50 Table of Contents piece of land in July and August 2007 totaling $71.5 million, and the purchase of our Los Angeles IBX property in June 2007 for $49.1 million, partially offset by net maturities and sales of our short-term investments. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily the result of the capital expenditures required to bring our recently opened IBX centers in the Chicago, Los Angeles and Silicon Valley metro areas to Equinix standards, the Washington, D.C., Chicago, New York and Tokyo metro area IBX expansion projects and to support our growing customer base, as well as the net purchases of $3.5 million of our short-term and long-term investments and the purchase of our Chicago IBX property in June 2006 for $9.8 million, offset by the proceeds from the sale of our Honolulu IBX in December 2006 of $9.5 million. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of the purchases of the Los Angeles IBX and Ashburn campus properties for $34.7 million and $53.8 million, respectively, and capital expenditures required to bring our recently acquired IBX centers in the Washington, D.C., Silicon Valley, Chicago and Los Angeles metro areas to Equinix standards and to support our growing customer base offset by the net sales and maturities of short-term and long-term investments of $12.2 million. For 2008 and beyond, we anticipate that our cash used in investing activities, excluding the purchases, sales and maturities of short-term and long-term investments, will primarily be for our capital expenditures, which we expect to be substantial, as well as for additional purchases of real estate or acquisitions like the Virtu acquisition in February 2008 that we may undertake in the future. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.1 billion, $46.1 million and $134.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was primarily the result of $646.0 million in gross proceeds from our convertible debt offerings, $149.6 million in gross proceeds from our loans payable in connection with the Chicago IBX financing, the Asia-Pacific financing and the European financing, $339.9 million in net proceeds from our common stock offering and $36.4 million in proceeds from our various employee stock plans, partially offset by debt issuance costs and principal payments for our capital leases and other financing obligations and the Ashburn campus mortgage payable. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily due to the $40.0 million borrowing under the $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line in September 2006, the $40.0 million additional financing under the Ashburn campus mortgage payable in December 2006 and proceeds from our various employee stock plans, partially offset by the repayment of $70.0 million in borrowings under the $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line and principal payments of $2.6 million for our capital lease and other financing obligations and the Ashburn campus mortgage payable. Net cash generated by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily the result of proceeds of $30.0 million from our borrowing on the $50.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line in October 2005, which we repaid in full in January 2006, proceeds of $60.0 million from our Ashburn campus financing in December 2005, proceeds of $38.1 million from our Los Angeles IBX financing and proceeds from the exercises of warrants and various employee stock plans, offset primarily by principal payments of $5.5 million for our various capital lease and other financing obligations. Debt Obligations—Convertible Debt Convertible Subordinated Debentures. During February 2004, we sold $86.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.50% convertible subordinated debentures due 2024, convertible into 2.2 million shares of our common stock, to qualified institutional buyers. The interest on the convertible subordinated debentures is payable semi-annually every February 15th and August 15th, which commenced August 2004. In March 2007, we entered into agreements with certain holders of these convertible subordinated debentures to exchange an aggregate of 1.4 million newly issued shares of our common stock for such holders’ $54.0 million of $86.3 million principal amount of the convertible subordinated debentures. The number of shares of common stock issued equals the amount issuable upon conversion of the convertible subordinated debentures in accordance with their original terms. In addition, each holder received cash consideration equal to accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date totaling $110,000, as well as the present value of future interest due through February 15, 2009 and an incremental fee, totaling $3.4 million, as an inducement fee. 51 Table of Contents Holders of the convertible subordinated debentures that remain outstanding may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on February 15, 2009, February 15, 2014 and February 15, 2019, in each case at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus any accrued and unpaid interest. At this time, holders of the convertible subordinated debentures may convert their debentures into shares of our common stock at any time at the option of the holder. We may redeem all or a portion of the debentures at any time after February 15, 2009 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures plus any accrued and unpaid interest. As of December 31, 2007, a total of $32.3 million convertible subordinated debentures remained outstanding and were convertible into 816,457 shares of our common stock. 2.50% Convertible Subordinated Notes. In March 2007, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.50% convertible subordinated notes due 2012. The initial conversion rate is 8.9259 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. This represents an initial conversion price of approximately $112.03 per share of common stock or 2.2 million shares of our common stock. Upon conversion, holders will receive, at our election, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. We have used the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the funding of our expansion activities and working capital requirements. Holders of the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes may convert their notes upon certain defined circumstances, including during any fiscal quarter (and only during that fiscal quarter) ending after June 30, 2007, if the sale price of our common stock, for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter, is greater than 130% of the conversion price per share of common stock on such last trading day, presently $145.64 per share. In addition, holders of the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes may convert their individual notes at any time on or after March 15, 2012. We may redeem all or a portion of the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes at any time after April 16, 2010 for cash but only if the closing sale price of our common stock for at least 20 of the 30 consecutive trading days immediately prior to the day we give notice of redemption is greater than 130% of the applicable conversion price per share of common stock on the date of the notice, presently $145.64 per share. The redemption price will equal 100% of the principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Upon conversion, due to the conversion formulas associated with the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes, if our stock is trading at levels exceeding 130% of the conversion price per share of common stock, and if we elect to pay any portion of the consideration in cash, additional consideration beyond the $250.0 million of gross proceeds received would be required. However, in no event would the total number of shares issuable upon conversion of the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes exceed 11.6036 per $1,000 principal amount of convertible subordinated notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, or the equivalent of $86.18 per share of common stock or a total of 2.9 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2007, the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes were convertible into 2.2 million shares of our common stock. 3.00% Convertible Subordinated Notes. In September 2007, we issued $396.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Convertible Subordinated Notes due October 15, 2014. Interest is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing April 15, 2008. Holders of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes may convert their notes at their option on any day up to and including the business day immediately preceding the maturity date into shares of our common stock. The base conversion rate is 7.436 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. This represents a base conversion price of approximately $134.48 per share of common stock. If, at the time of conversion, the applicable stock price of our common stock exceeds the base conversion price, the conversion rate will be determined pursuant to a formula resulting in the receipt of up 52 Table of Contents to 4.4616 additional shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. However, in no event would the total number of shares issuable upon conversion of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes exceed 11.8976 per $1,000 principal amount of 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, or the equivalent of $84.05 per share of our common stock or a total of 4.7 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2007, the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes were convertible into 2.9 million shares of our common stock. Debt Obligations—Non-Convertible Debt Washington D.C. Metro Area IBX Capital Lease. In April 2004, we entered into a long-term lease for a 95,000 square foot data center in the Washington, D.C. metro area. The center is adjacent to our existing Washington D.C. metro area IBX center. This lease, which includes the leasing of all of the IBX plant and machinery equipment located in the building, is a capital lease. We took possession of this property during the fourth quarter of 2004, and as a result, recorded property and equipment assets, as well as a capital lease obligation, totaling $35.3 million. Payments under this lease will be made monthly through October 2019 at an effective interest rate of 8.50% per annum. As of December 31, 2007, principal of $32.7 million remained outstanding under this capital lease. San Jose IBX Equipment and Fiber Financing. In December 2004, we entered into a long-term lease for a 103,000 square foot data center in San Jose, and at the same time entered into separate agreements to purchase the equipment located within this new IBX center and to interconnect all three of our Silicon Valley area IBX centers to each other through redundant dark fiber links. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, these three separate agreements are considered to be a single arrangement. Furthermore, while the building component of this transaction is classified as a long-term operating lease, the equipment and fiber portions of the transaction are classified as financed assets. We took possession of this property during the first quarter of 2005, and as a result, recorded property and equipment and prepaid fiber assets, as well as a financing obligation, totaling $18.7 million. Payments under this financing obligation will be made monthly through May 2020 at an effective interest rate of 8.50% per annum. As of December 31, 2007, principal of $14.5 million remained outstanding under this financing obligation. Chicago IBX Equipment Financing. In July 2005, we entered into a long-term sublease for a 107,000 square foot data center in Chicago, and at the same time entered into a separate agreement to purchase the equipment located within this IBX center. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, these two separate agreements are considered to be a single arrangement. Furthermore, while the building component of this transaction is classified as a long-term operating lease, the equipment portion of the transaction is classified as financed assets. We took possession of this property and title to the equipment assets in November 2005, and as a result, recorded IBX equipment assets, as well as a financing obligation, totaling $9.7 million at that time. Payments under this financing obligation will be made monthly through August 2015 at an effective interest rate of 7.50% per annum. As of December 31, 2007, principal of $7.5 million remained outstanding under this financing obligation. Los Angeles IBX Financing. In September 2005, we purchased a 107,000 square foot data center in the Los Angeles metro area for $34.7 million, which we paid for in full with cash in September 2005. In October 2005, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell this Los Angeles IBX for $38.7 million and to lease it back from the purchaser pursuant to a long-term lease, which closed in December 2005, and we received net proceeds from the sale of this property of $38.1 million. However, due to our continuing involvement in regards to certain aspects of this property, the sale and leaseback of this property does not qualify as a sale-leaseback under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, but rather is accounted for as a financing of the property. We refer to this portion of the transaction as the Los Angeles IBX financing. Pursuant to the Los Angeles IBX financing, we recorded a financing obligation liability totaling $38.1 million in December 2005. Payments under the Los Angeles IBX financing will be made monthly through December 2025 at an effective interest rate of 7.75% per annum. As of December 31, 2007, principal of $37.9 million remained outstanding under this financing obligation. 53 Table of Contents Ashburn Campus Mortgage Payable. In December 2005, we completed the financing of our October 2005 purchase of the Ashburn campus property with a $60.0 million mortgage to be amortized over 20 years. Upon receipt of the $60.0 million of cash in December 2005, we recorded a $60.0 million mortgage payable. Payments under the Ashburn campus mortgage payable will be made monthly through January 2026 at an effective interest rate of 8.1% per annum. In December 2006, we obtained an additional financing of $40.0 million under the Ashburn campus mortgage payable, which increased the total amount financed under the Ashburn campus mortgage payable to $100.0 million, on the same terms as the initial mortgage payable. As of December 31, 2007, principal of $96.7 million remained outstanding under this mortgage payable. $75.0 Million Silicon Valley Bank Revolving Credit Line. In August 2006, we amended the Silicon Valley Bank credit line by entering into a $75.0 million revolving line of credit agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, replacing the previously outstanding $50.0 million line of credit arrangement, and adding General Electric Capital Corporation (GE) as a lender. The $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line allows for issuance of letters of credit (in addition to revolving borrowings), which has the effect of reducing the amount available for borrowing under the $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line (the letters of credit sublimit). The $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line also has an option for us to increase the amount of the line to $100.0 million at a later date, subject to approval of the lender or lenders electing to participate in such increase. In March 2007, we amended certain provisions of the Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line which related to certain financial covenants, the addition of a liquidity covenant and the revision of the definition of “Approved Subordinated Debt” in order to allow us to proceed with the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes offering. The liquidity covenant requires us to maintain total liquidity of at least $75.0 million. The liquidity covenant is defined as the sum of cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, 80% of long term investments and 10% of net accounts receivable. In the event of a default, Silicon Valley Bank has the right to exercise a notice of control to give Silicon Valley Bank the sole right to control, direct or dispose of the assets as it deems necessary to satisfy our obligations under the Silicon Valley Bank Credit Line, if any. In October 2007, we further amended certain provisions of the Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line which related to certain financial covenants and the definition of “Designation of Obligations” to include our 3.00% convertible subordinated notes offering that closed on September 26, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in connection with the $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. Borrowings under the $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line, if drawn, will bear interest at variable interest rates, plus the applicable margins, which were in effect prior to the amendments, based on either prime rates or LIBOR rates. The $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line matures on September 15, 2008 and remains secured by substantially all of our domestic personal property assets and certain of our real property leases. As of December 31, 2007, we had a total of $13.0 million of outstanding letters of credit under the letters of credit sublimit of the $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line reducing the amount of borrowings available to us to $62.0 million. These letters of credit automatically renew in successive one-year periods until the final termination. If the beneficiaries of these letters of credit decide to draw down on these letters of credit, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowings under the $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. However, no borrowings were outstanding under the $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. As of December 31, 2007, had we borrowed against the Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line, such borrowings would have had an approximate interest rate of 7.35% per annum. Chicago IBX Financing. In February 2007, our wholly-owned subsidiary obtained a loan of up to $110.0 million to finance up to 60% of the development and construction costs of the Chicago metro area IBX expansion project, which we refer to as the Chicago IBX financing. Funds are advanced at up to 60% of project costs incurred. As of December 31, 2007, we had received advances representing a loan payable totaling $105.6 million. As a result, up to $4.4 million remained available for borrowing from the Chicago IBX financing and is expected to be borrowed during the first quarter of 2008. The loan payable has a maturity date of January 31, 2010, with options to extend for up to an additional two years, in one-year increments, upon satisfaction of certain extension conditions. The loan payable bears interest at a floating rate (one, three or six month LIBOR 54 Table of Contents plus 2.75%) with interest payable monthly, which commenced March 1, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, the loan payable had an approximate interest rate of 7.56% per annum. The Chicago IBX financing has no specific financial covenants and contains a limited parent company guaranty. In February 2008, we received additional advances totaling $1.7 million, bringing the cumulative loan payable to date to $107.3 million with an approximate blended interest rate of 6.08% per annum. Asia-Pacific Financing. In August 2007, our two wholly-owned subsidiaries, located in Singapore and Tokyo, Japan, entered into an approximately $40.0 million multi-currency credit facility agreement. The Asia-Pacific financing has a four-year term that allows these two subsidiaries to borrow up to 23.0 million Singapore dollars and 2.9 billion Japanese yen, respectively, during the first 12-month period with repayment to occur over the remaining three years in 12 equal quarterly installments. Amounts undrawn at the end of the first 12-month period shall be cancelled. The Asia-Pacific financing has a commitment fee of 0.3% on unutilized amounts during the 12-month draw period and bears interest at a floating rate (the relevant three-month local cost of funds for Singapore and Japan), as applicable, plus 1.85%-2.50% depending on the ratio of our senior indebtedness to our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, with interest payable quarterly. The Asia-Pacific financing may be used by these two subsidiaries to fund capital expenditures on leasehold improvements, equipment, and other installation costs related to expansion plans in Singapore and Tokyo. The Asia-Pacific Financing is guaranteed by the parent company and is secured by the assets of these two subsidiaries, including a pledge of their shares, and has several financial covenants, with which we must comply quarterly. As of December 31, 2007, we borrowed 18.3 million Singapore dollars at an initial interest rate per annum of 4.66% and 1.5 billion Japanese yen at an initial interest rate per annum of 2.69%. Collectively the amounts borrowed equal $25.9 million leaving $14.1 million available to borrow under the Asia-Pacific financing. As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in connection with the Asia-Pacific financing. In January 2008, the Asia-Pacific financing was amended to allow our subsidiary in Australia to borrow up to 32.0 million Australian dollars under the same general terms described above. This amendment increased the Asia-Pacific financing to approximately $68.0 million. European Financing. In September 2007, as a result of the IXEurope acquisition, our wholly-owned subsidiary acquired a senior facilities agreement totaling 82.0 million British pounds (or approximately $162.9 million as translated using effective exchange rates as of December 31, 2007). The European financing is comprised of three facilities: (i) Facility A, which is available to draw upon through March 2008, provides for a term loan of up to 40.0 million British pounds and bears a floating interest rate per annum of between 1.00% and 2.25% above LIBOR or EURIBOR; (ii) Facility B, which is available to draw upon through June 2010, provides for a term loan of up to 40.0 million British pounds and bears a floating interest rate per annum of between 1.00% and 2.25% above LIBOR or EURIBOR and (iii) Facility C, which is available to draw upon through May 2014, provides for a revolving credit facility of up to 2.0 million British pounds and bears a floating interest rate per annum of between 0.875% and 2.125% above LIBOR or EURIBOR. The European financing has a final maturity date of June 30, 2014 and interest is payable in periods of one, two, three or six months at our election. Facility A will be repaid in 13 semi-annual installments commencing June 30, 2008. Facility B will be repaid in nine semi-annual installments commencing June 30, 2010. Facility C will be repaid at the final maturity date. The European financing is available to fund our subsidiary’s current or future operations in Europe, including capital expenditures, for certain pre-approved subsidiaries in Europe. The European financing is collateralized by certain of our assets in Europe and contains several financial covenants with which we must comply quarterly. As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in connection with the European financing. Upon a written request from us at any time after December 31, 2007 and through the final maturity date, and upon approval by the lenders, an additional term loan of up to 15.0 million British pounds (or approximately $29.8 million as translated using effective exchange rates as of December 31, 2007) may be made available to us. The European financing requires us to hedge the floating interest rates inherent in the European financing. As a result, we have two interest rate swaps outstanding in connection with the European financing, which are accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No., 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, as amended. As of December 31, 2007, we had borrowed a total of 42.0 million British pounds (or 55 Table of Contents approximately $83.6 million as translated using effective exchange rates as of December 31, 2007) under the European financing at a blended interest rate of 7.74% per annum leaving 40.0 million British pounds (or approximately $79.3 million as translated using effective exchange rates as of December 31, 2007) available to borrow under the European financing. In January 2008, we received additional advances totaling 7.7 million British pounds or approximately $15.2 million, bringing the cumulative loan payable to date to 49.7 million British pounds or approximately $98.8 million with a blended interest rate of 7.39% per annum. Senior Bridge Loan. In June 2007, we entered into a senior bridge loan with Citibank, N.A., as lender, and as agent for the lender, for a principal amount of $500.0 million, to finance our IXEurope acquisition. We incurred $2.5 million of debt issuance costs to secure the senior bridge loan. In September 2007, the senior bridge loan was terminated unused and, as a result, we incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of $2.5 million reflecting the immediate write-off of debt issuance costs previously capitalized. Other Note Payable. In December 2007, we reclassified a total of $18.7 million of accrued restructuring liability related to the 2005 restructuring charge to other note payable. The other note payable is a non-interest bearing note but has an imputed interest rate of 6.14% per annum. Payments under the other note payable are payable quarterly and will be payable through the fourth quarter of 2009. Debt Maturities, Financings, Leases and Other Contractual Commitments We lease our IBX centers and certain equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements expiring through 2027. The following represents our debt maturities, financings, leases and other contractual commitments as of December 31, 2007 (in thousands): 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 andthereafter Total Convertible debt (1) $ — $ 32,250 $ — $ — $ 250,000 $ 395,986 $ 678,236 Chicago IBX financing (1) — — 105,612 — — — 105,612 Asia-Pacific financing (1) 2,161 8,645 8,644 6,483 — — 25,933 European financing (1) 2,037 10,186 10,391 12,429 12,532 35,969 83,544 Interest (2) 34,332 33,627 26,204 25,223 19,643 30,977 170,006 Mortgage payable (3) 10,164 10,164 10,164 10,164 10,165 133,503 184,324 Other note payable (3) 10,000 10,000 — — — — 20,000 Capital lease and other financing obligations (3) 11,622 11,707 11,711 11,779 11,390 106,647 164,856 Operating leases under accrued restructuring charges (3) 3,973 4,025 4,094 4,224 4,472 11,524 32,312 Operating leases (4) 47,320 47,331 44,771 40,227 39,574 211,857 431,080 Other contractual commitments (4) 128,765 4,254 4,306 — — — 137,325 $ 250,374 $ 172,189 $ 225,897 $ 110,529 $ 347,776 $ 926,463 $ 2,033,228 (1) Represents principal only. (2) Represents interest on convertible debt, Chicago IBX financing, Asia-Pacific financing and European financing based on their approximate interest rates as of December 31, 2007. (3) Represents principal and interest. (4) Represents off-balance sheet arrangements. Other contractual commitments are described below. Primarily as a result of our various IBX expansion projects, as of December 31, 2007, we were contractually committed for $100.1 million of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for IBX equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided, in connection with the work necessary to open these IBX centers prior to making them available to customers for installation. This amount, which is expected to be paid during 2008, is reflected in the table above as “other contractual commitments.” 56 Table of Contents We have other, non-capital purchase commitments in place as of December 31, 2007, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations, primarily in the U.S., Singapore and the United Kingdom, through 2008 and thereafter, and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods or services to be delivered or provided during 2008. Such other purchase commitments as of December 31, 2007, which total $37.2 million, are also reflected in the table above as “other contractual commitments.” In addition, although we are not contractually obligated to do so, we expect to incur additional capital expenditures beyond the $100.1 million contractually committed as of December 31, 2007 in our various IBX expansion projects during 2008 of approximately $150.0 million to $200.0 million in order to complete the work needed to open these IBX centers. These non-contractual capital expenditures are not reflected in the table above. As previously discussed above, in connection with six of our IBX operating leases and one utilities contract, we have entered into seven irrevocable letters of credit totaling $13.0 million with Silicon Valley Bank, provided in lieu of cash deposits under the letters of credit sublimit provision of the $75.0 million Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. If the beneficiaries of these letters of credit decide to draw down on these letters of credit, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowings under the Silicon Valley Bank revolving credit line. These contingent commitments are not reflected in the table above. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007. . In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-1, which provides supplemental guidance on the application of SFAS No. 157, and FSP FAS 157-2, which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS No. 159”). SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. While we will not elect to adopt fair value accounting to any assets or liabilities allowed by SFAS No. 159, we are currently still in the process of evaluating SFAS No. 159 and its potential impact to us. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS No. 141(R)”). SFAS No. 141(R) replaces SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations.” SFAS 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired or a gain from a bargain purchase. SFAS No. 141R also determines disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or after December 15, 2008 and there are also implications for acquisitions that occur prior to this date. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements” (“SFAS No. 160”). SFAS No. 160 amends ARB 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, and requires all entities to report noncontrolling (minority) interests in subsidiaries within equity in the consolidated financial statements, but separate from the parent shareholders’ equity. SFAS No. 160 also requires any acquisitions or dispositions of noncontrolling interests that do not result in a change of control to be accounted for as equity 57 Table of Contents transactions. Further, SFAS No. 160 requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, if any. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk The following discussion about market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. See Note 5 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale and are therefore recorded at fair market value on our condensed consolidated balance sheets with the unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income or loss. We consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge for our securities, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. The fair market value of our marketable securities could be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, but we do not believe such impact would be material. Securities with longer maturities are subject to a greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities and as of December 31, 2007 our weighted-average portfolio maturity was relatively short. If current interest rates were to increase or decrease by 10% from their position as of December 31, 2007, the fair market value of our investment portfolio could increase or decrease by approximately $249,000. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates from their position as of December 31, 2007 would furthermore not have a material impact on our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of the majority of our debt obligations. The interest expense associated with our Chicago IBX financing, Asia-Pacific financing and European financing, which bear interest at floating rates tied to local cost of funds or LIBOR/EURIBOR, could be affected. For every 100 basis point change in interest rates, our interest expense could increase or decrease by a total of $2.1 million based on the total balance of our borrowings under the Chicago IBX financing, Asia-Pacific financing and European financing as of December 31, 2007. The fair market value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate changes may affect the fair market value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair market value of our convertible subordinated debentures and convertible subordinated notes is based on quoted market prices. The estimated fair value of our convertible subordinated debentures at December 31, 2007 was approximately $83.7 million. The estimated fair value of our 2.50% convertible subordinated notes at December 31, 2007 was approximately $284.3 million. The estimated fair value of our 3.00% convertible subordinated notes at December 31, 2007 was approximately $487.2 million. We acquired interest rate swaps in connection with the European financing, which itself was acquired in connection with the IXEurope acquisition. Interest incurred for the European financing is based on variable LIBOR and EURIBOR interest rates and exposes us to interest rate risk. To mitigate the interest rate exposure, IXEurope had entered into two interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of the European financing in order to transfer floating rate exposure to the counterparty in exchange for fixed payments by us. Upon the date 58 Table of Contents of the IXEurope acquisition and through December 31, 2007, these interest rate swaps were considered not to be effective hedges under the provisions of SFAS No. 133. As a result, the change in fair value of these two interest rate swaps totaling a loss of $138,000 was recorded as a reduction of interest expense in our statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007. We may enter into additional hedging agreements in the future to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk. Foreign Currency Risk The majority of our revenues and costs is denominated in U.S. dollars, generated mostly from customers and vendors in the U.S. Approximately 23% of our revenues and 24% of our costs were outside the U.S., and a large portion of those revenues and costs were denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Singapore dollar, Japanese yen, Hong Kong and Australian dollars, British pound, Swiss franc and Euro. We anticipate that in 2008 and beyond, approximately 30-40% of our revenues and costs will be generated and incurred outside of the U.S. in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, our operating results and cash flows are impacted by currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, to the extent that our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our services less competitive in the international markets. Although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations, and when appropriate, may use financial hedging techniques to minimize the effect of these fluctuations, there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future. In July and August 2007, we entered into forward contracts to purchase 265.2 million British pounds at an average forward rate of 2.020007, or the equivalent of $535.6 million, for purposes of hedging a portion of the purchase price of the IXEurope acquisition. Upon cash payment in September 2007, we recorded a foreign exchange gain of $1.5 million, which is reflected within other income (expense) on our statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007. We may enter into additional hedging agreements in the future to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency risk. Commodity Price Risk Certain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of price changes are electricity and supplies and equipment used in our IBX centers. We are closely monitoring the cost of electricity at all of our locations. In addition, as we are now building new, “greenfield” IBX centers, we are subject to commodity price risk for building materials related to the construction of these IBX centers, such as steel and copper. In addition, the lead-time to procure certain pieces of equipment is substantial, such as generators. Any delays in procuring the necessary pieces of equipment for the construction of our IBX centers could delay the anticipated openings of these new IBX centers and, as a result, increase the cost of these projects. We currently do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk.",2023-12-30 20:27:48.985182
1101239,EQIX,EQUINIX INC,2009,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information in this discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements are based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. For example, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist readers in understanding our financial information from our management’s perspective and is presented as follows: • Overview • Results of Operations • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements • Critical Accounting Estimates • Recent Accounting Pronouncements Overview Equinix provides network-neutral colocation, interconnection and managed services to global enterprises, content providers, financial companies and the world’s largest network service providers. As of December 31, 2008, we operated IBX centers in the Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. metro areas in the United States, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom in the Europe region, and Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore in the Asia-Pacific region. We entered the European region in September 2007 through our acquisition of IXEurope Plc, or IXEurope, headquartered in London, U.K. We refer to this transaction as the IXEurope acquisition. We then acquired Virtu Secure Webservices B.V., or Virtu, based in the Netherlands to supplement our European operations in February 2008. We refer to this transaction as the Virtu acquisition. Direct interconnection to our aggregation of networks, which serve more than 90% of the world’s Internet routes, allows our customers to increase performance while significantly reducing costs. Based on our network-neutral model and the quality of our IBX centers, we believe we have established a critical mass of customers. As more customers locate in our IBX centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to do so as well to gain the full economic and performance benefits of direct interconnection. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a “network effect” of customer adoption. Our interconnection services enable scalable, reliable and cost-effective interconnection and traffic exchange thus lowering overall cost and increasing flexibility. Our focused business model is based on our critical mass of customers and the resulting network effect. This critical mass and the resulting network effect, combined with our strong financial position, continue to drive new customer growth and bookings. Historically, our market has been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled their telecommunications products and services with their colocation offerings. Each of these colocation providers own and operate a network. We do not own or operate a network, yet have greater than 300 networks operating 33 Table of Contents out of our IBX centers. As a result, we are able to offer our customers a substantial choice of networks given our network neutrality thereby allowing our customers to choose from numerous network service providers. We believe this is a distinct and sustainable competitive advantage. On a consolidated basis our customer count increased to 2,272, excluding the impact of the Virtu acquisition, as of December 31, 2008 versus 1,881 as of December 31, 2007, an increase of 21%. Including the impact of the Virtu acquisition, our customer count was 2,757 as of December 31, 2008, an increase of 47%. Our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus net sellable cabinet space available taking into account power limitations. Excluding the impact of the IXEurope and the Virtu acquisitions, our utilization rate increased to 81% as of December 31, 2008 versus 73% as of December 31, 2007; however, further excluding the impact of our IBX center expansion projects that have opened during the last 12 months, our utilization rate would have been 85% as of December 31, 2008. Our utilization rate varies from market to market among our IBX centers across the U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain of our high power demand customers. This increased power consumption has driven the requirement to build out our new IBX centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX centers. We could face power limitations in our centers even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific IBX center. This could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows. Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and service offerings. As was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors such as demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, capacity availability in current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to break-even and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. Dependent on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to Equinix standards. Property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant. Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation, interconnection and managed infrastructure services. We consider these services recurring as our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues comprise greater than 90% of our total revenues. Over the past few years, greater than half of our then existing customers ordered new services in any given quarter representing greater than half of the new orders received in each quarter, contributing to our revenue growth. Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer’s initial deployment and professional services that we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring as they are billed typically once and upon completion of the installation or professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. As a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future. Our U.S. revenues are derived primarily from colocation and interconnection services while our Europe and Asia-Pacific revenues are derived primarily from colocation and managed infrastructure services. 34 Table of Contents The largest cost components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX centers, utility costs, including electricity and bandwidth, IBX center employees’ salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment and security services. A substantial majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing IBX centers or open new IBX centers. However, there are certain costs which are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. We expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will increase in the future on a per-unit or fixed basis in addition to the variable increase related to the growth of consumption by the customer. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months as compared to other times of the year. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer contract intangible assets. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees, and other general corporate expenses such as our corporate headquarters office lease and some depreciation expense. Due to our recurring revenue model and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature and generally does not grow in proportion to revenue growth, we expect our cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses to decline as a percentage of revenue over time, although we expect each of them to grow in absolute dollars in connection to our growth. This is evident in the trends noted below in our discussion on our results of operations. However, for cost of revenues, this trend may periodically be impacted when a large expansion project opens and before it starts generating any meaningful revenue. Results of Operations Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 include the operations of Virtu from February 5, 2008 to December 31, 2008. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 include the operations of IXEurope from September 14, 2007 to December 31, 2007, but do not include the operations of Virtu. 35 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, Change 2008 % 2007 % $ % U.S: Recurring revenues $ 425,964 61 % $ 311,776 74 % $ 114,188 37 % Non-recurring revenues 16,839 2 % 13,102 3 % 3,737 29 % 442,803 63 % 324,878 77 % 117,925 36 % Europe: Recurring revenues 165,931 23 % 35,309 9 % 130,622 370 % Non-recurring revenues 11,571 2 % 2,181 0 % 9,390 431 % 177,502 25 % 37,490 9 % 140,012 373 % Asia-Pacific: Recurring revenues $ 78,192 11 % $ 52,571 13 % $ 25,621 49 % Non-recurring revenues 6,183 1 % 4,503 1 % 1,680 37 % 84,375 12 % 57,074 14 % 27,301 48 % Total: Recurring revenues 670,087 95 % 399,656 95 % 270,431 68 % Non-recurring revenues 34,593 5 % 19,786 5 % 14,807 75 % $ 704,680 100 % $ 419,442 100 % $ 285,238 68 % U.S. Revenues. The period over period growth in recurring revenues was primarily the result of an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX centers, as well as selective price increases in each of our IBX markets. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $30.6 million of revenue generated from our newly-opened IBX centers or IBX center expansions in the Chicago, New York, Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. metro areas. We expect that our U.S. revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in these newly-opened IBX centers and additional expansions currently taking place in the Los Angeles and New York metro areas, both of which are expected to open during mid-2009. Europe Revenues. Our revenues from the United Kingdom, the largest revenue contributor in the Europe region, represented approximately 38% and 37%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Our Europe revenues have increased over the course of 2008 as this region has grown due to our expansion efforts and we expect our Europe revenues to continue to grow in future periods, as a result of our newly-opened IBX center expansions in the Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris metro areas and additional expansions currently taking place in the Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris metro areas, all of which are expected to open during the first half of 2009, with the exception of the current London expansion which is expected to open during the first half of 2010. Asia-Pacific Revenues. Our revenues from Singapore, the largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, represented approximately 36% and 35%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. As in the U.S., Asia-Pacific revenue growth was due to an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX centers, as well as selective price increases in each of our IBX markets. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $12.5 million of revenue generated from our IBX center expansions in the Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo metro areas. We 36 Table of Contents expect that our Asia-Pacific revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in these newly-opened IBX center expansions and additional expansions currently taking place in the Sydney metro area, which is expected to open during the first half of 2009, and the Hong Kong and Singapore metro areas which are expected to open during the second half of 2009. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, Change 2008 % 2007 % $ % U.S. $ 238,443 57 % $ 198,432 75 % $ 40,011 20 % Europe 122,658 30 % 30,245 12 % 92,413 306 % Asia-Pacific 53,558 13 % 35,068 13 % 18,490 53 % Total $ 414,659 100 % $ 263,745 100 % $ 150,914 57 % Years endedDecember 31, 2008 2007 Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues: U.S. 54 % 61 % Europe 69 % 81 % Asia-Pacific 63 % 61 % Total 59 % 63 % U.S. Cost of Revenues. U.S. cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 included $91.8 million and $73.6 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was due to our IBX center expansion activity. Excluding depreciation, the increase in U.S. cost of revenues was primarily due to overall growth related to our revenue growth and costs associated with our expansion projects, including (i) an increase of $15.7 million in utility costs as a result of increased customer installations, (ii) $6.0 million in higher compensation costs and (iii) an increase of $2.3 million in repair and maintenance costs, partially offset by a decrease of $3.0 million in rent and facility costs as a result of certain property acquisitions in 2007 and 2008. We anticipate that our U.S. cost of revenues will continue to increase in the foreseeable future to the extent that the occupancy levels in our U.S. IBX centers increase and as our newly-opened IBX centers or IBX center expansions commence operations more fully during 2009 and from our additional expansion activity currently taking place in the Los Angeles and New York metro areas. We expect U.S. cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business. Europe Cost of Revenues. Europe cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 included $33.5 million and $7.6 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Our Europe cost of revenues have increased over the course of 2008 as this region has grown due to our expansion efforts and we anticipate our Europe cost of revenues will continue to increase in future periods, as we sell out the available space in our existing data centers, as our newly-opened IBX centers or IBX center expansions commence operations more fully during 2009 and from our additional expansion activity currently taking place in the Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris metro areas. We expect Europe cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 included $17.6 million and $9.3 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was due to our IBX center expansion activity. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily the result of costs associated with our expansion projects and overall growth in connection with revenue growth, such as $4.2 million of higher utility costs arising from increased customer installations and revenues attributed to customer growth, as well as $2.5 million of additional rent 37 Table of Contents expense associated with new leases in connection with our recently-opened IBX center expansions and with our additional expansion activity currently taking place in the Hong Kong, Singapore and Sydney metro areas. We expect Asia-Pacific cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business. Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, Change 2008 % 2007 % $ % U.S. $ 38,219 57 % $ 31,291 77 % $ 6,928 22 % Europe 19,331 29 % 2,987 7 % 16,344 547 % Asia-Pacific 9,363 14 % 6,441 16 % 2,922 45 % Total $ 66,913 100 % $ 40,719 100 % $ 26,194 64 % Years endedDecember 31, 2008 2007 Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues: U.S. 9 % 10 % Europe 11 % 8 % Asia-Pacific 11 % 11 % Total 9 % 10 % U.S. Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in U.S. sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to an increase of $3.3 million in sales compensation costs as a result of revenue growth and $2.6 million of higher expenditures related to our branding initiatives. We expect U.S. sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to grow our business and invest further in various branding initiatives; however, as a percentage of revenues, we expect them to decrease. Europe Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our Europe sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 included $6.0 million and $1.8 million of amortization expense related to customer contract intangible assets. Excluding amortization expense, our Europe sales and marketing expenses have grown over the course of 2008 as we grew this business and invested in various branding and integration initiatives. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we also recorded $1.3 million of bad debt expense in the Europe region due largely to integration of accounting policies in connection with internal control compliance initiatives. We expect Europe sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to grow our business; however, as a percentage of revenues, we expect them to decrease. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to an increase in sales compensation over the prior period associated with the overall growth in this region and with expenditures related to our branding initiatives. We expect Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to grow our business; however, as a percentage of revenues, we expect them to decrease. 38 Table of Contents General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, Change 2008 % 2007 % $ % U.S. $ 96,657 66 % $ 83,215 79 % $ 13,442 16 % Europe 34,071 23 % 8,292 7 % 25,779 311 % Asia-Pacific 15,836 11 % 14,287 14 % 1,549 11 % Total $ 146,564 100 % $ 105,794 100 % $ 40,770 39 % Years endedDecember 31, 2008 2007 General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues: U.S. 22 % 26 % Europe 19 % 22 % Asia-Pacific 19 % 25 % Total 21 % 25 % U.S. General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in U.S. general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $7.9 million of higher compensation costs, including increases in general salary, bonuses and stock-based compensation, and headcount growth (259 U.S. general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2008 versus 220 as of December 31, 2007), (ii) an increase of $2.6 million in professional fees related to various consulting projects to support our growth and (iii) an increase in depreciation expense as a result of our continued investment in information technology systems to support our growth. Going forward, we expect U.S. general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth; however, as a percentage of revenues, we expect them to decrease. Europe General and Administrative Expenses. Our Europe general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 included $7.8 million and $862,000, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, our Europe general and administrative expenses have increased over the course of 2008 in connection with our growth and integration initiatives. We expect our Europe general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth and in connection with various ongoing integration initiatives related to investments in systems and internal control compliance; however, as a percentage of revenues, we expect them to decrease. Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher compensation costs, including general salary increases and bonuses. Going forward, we expect Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth; however, as a percentage of revenues, we expect them to decrease. Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a restructuring charge adjustment of $3.1 million from revised sublease assumptions on our two excess space leases in the Los Angeles and New York metro areas as a result of new information becoming available. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a restructuring charge adjustment of $407,000 from revised sublease assumptions for the excess space lease in the Los Angeles metro area as a result of new information becoming available. The original restructuring charge for these two leases was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 and totaled $17.7 million. We are contractually committed to these two excess space leases through 2015. In February 2009, we decided to utilize the space we previously abandoned in order to expand our original Los Angeles IBX center. Accordingly, we will reverse the restructuring reserve during the three months ended March 31, 2009 associated with the Los Angeles lease (see Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial 39 Table of Contents Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). We estimate that this restructuring reserve reversal is approximately $5.7 million, which will be reflected in our financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2009. Our excess space lease in the New York metro area will remain abandoned and continue to carry a restructuring charge. Gains on Asset Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a $1.3 million gain in connection with the sale of our Equinix mail service offering, which we sold for $1.7 million in gross cash proceeds. No gains on asset sales were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2008. Interest Income. Interest income decreased to $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Interest income decreased primarily due to lower yields on invested balances and lower average cash balances. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 2.77% versus 5.08% for the year ended December 31, 2007. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded realized losses from our investment portfolio, including a $1.5 million loss on one of our money market accounts as more fully described in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We expect our interest income to decrease for the foreseeable future due primarily to lower yields on our investment portfolio and lower average cash balances. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to new financings entered into during 2007 and 2008 consisting of (i) our $110.0 million Chicago IBX financing, which was drawn down during the construction period of the Chicago metro area IBX expansion project and which became fully drawn in March 2008, with an approximate interest rate of 4.19% per annum; (ii) our $250.0 million 2.50% convertible subordinated notes offering in March 2007; (iii) our approximately $91.0 million Asia-Pacific financing, of which approximately $63.2 million was drawn during 2008 and, which was fully drawn as of December 31, 2008, with an approximate blended interest rate of 3.69% per annum; (iv) our $396.0 million 3.00% convertible subordinated notes offering in September 2007; (v) our approximately $131.0 million European financing, of which approximately $72.7 million was drawn during 2008 leaving only approximately $2.9 million remaining available to draw, with an approximate blended interest rate of 4.39% per annum and (vi) our Netherlands financing of approximately $6.5 million, acquired as a result of the Virtu acquisition, with an approximate interest rate of 4.18% per annum. This increase was partially offset by the partial conversion of $13.1 million of our 2.50% convertible subordinated debentures in November 2008 that resulted in a decrease in interest expense. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we capitalized $6.0 million and $7.7 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. Going forward, we expect to incur higher interest expense as we fully utilize or recognize the full impact of our existing financings to fund our expansion efforts and as we complete expansion efforts and cease to capitalize interest expense. In addition, commencing in 2009, interest expense will increase due to a new accounting pronouncement, FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion.” For further information, refer to “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other Income (Expense). For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $1.3 million of other income, primarily attributable to foreign currency exchange gains during the year. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded $3.0 million of other income, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains including a foreign exchange gain of $1.5 million as a result of hedging a portion of the IXEurope acquisition purchase price with forward contracts. Loss on Conversion and Extinguishment of Debt. In March 2007, we retired $54.0 million of our convertible subordinated debentures in exchange for approximately 1.4 million newly issued shares of our common stock. As a result, we recorded a $3.4 million loss on debt conversion in accordance with FASB No. 84, “Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt,” due to the inducement fee paid. In September 2007, a senior bridge loan was terminated unused and, as a result, we recorded a $2.5 million loss on debt extinguishment reflecting 40 Table of Contents the immediate write-off of capitalized debt issuance costs to secure the senior bridge loan. As a result of these two events, during the year ended December 31, 2007 we recognized a total of $5.9 million of loss on debt conversion and extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we did not record any loss on conversion or extinguishment of debt in our statements of operations. Income Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $104.5 million of income tax benefits primarily due to recognition of deferred tax assets of $101.9 million and $6.1 million associated with our U.S. and Australian operations, respectively, partially offset by tax provisions from other jurisdictions. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded $473,000 of income tax expense primarily attributable to our foreign operations. As of December 31, 2008, we had a total valuation allowance of $40.3 million against our deferred tax assets, which is attributable to certain of our foreign operations. Once we release this remaining valuation allowance, it will impact our results of operations in the periods such a determination is made. We have not paid any significant cash income taxes since inception and we do not expect to pay any significant cash income taxes during 2009. Going forward, primarily as a result of the recognition of our U.S. deferred tax assets, we will commence the recording of income tax expense at the expected effective blended tax rates. As of December 31, 2008, we had total net deferred tax assets of $98.6 million consisting primarily of favorable temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards, the majority of which are attributable to our U.S. operations. Approximately $195.0 million of future pretax earnings for financial reporting purposes would need to be generated to realize these favorable temporary differences associated with our U.S. operations. In addition, approximately $54.0 million of future taxable income would need to be generated in future years to realize these net operating loss carryforwards associated with our U.S. operations. We believe it is achievable based on our current level of pretax earnings and our profitability forecast for future years. Historically, the difference between the pretax earnings for financial reporting purposes and the taxable income for income tax purposes in our U.S. operations has primarily included temporary adjustments such as depreciation expense, stock-based compensation and capital lease expenses. The temporary differences either increase or decrease the pretax earnings for financial reporting purposes to arrive at the taxable income for income tax purposes. However, it is expected that these temporary differences will generally increase the taxable income in the foreseeable future. The majority of the net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes in our U.S. operations does not start to expire until 2023. 41 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, Change 2007 % 2006 % $ % U.S: Recurring revenues $ 311,776 74 % $ 235,363 82 % $ 76,413 32 % Non-recurring revenues 13,102 3 % 10,703 4 % 2,399 22 % 324,878 77 % 246,066 86 % 78,812 32 % Asia-Pacific: Recurring revenues 52,571 13 % 37,797 13 % 14,774 39 % Non-recurring revenues 4,503 1 % 3,052 1 % 1,451 48 % 57,074 14 % 40,849 14 % 16,225 40 % Europe: Recurring revenues 35,309 9 % — — 35,309 100 % Non-recurring revenues 2,181 0 % — — 2,181 100 % 37,490 9 % — — 37,490 100 % Total: Recurring revenues 399,656 95 % 273,160 95 % 126,496 46 % Non-recurring revenues 19,786 5 % 13,755 5 % 6,031 44 % $ 419,442 100 % $ 286,915 100 % $ 132,527 46 % U.S. Revenues. The period over period growth in recurring revenues was primarily the result of an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX centers, as well as selective price increases in each of our IBX markets. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded $15.3 million of revenues generated from our newly-opened IBX centers in the Chicago, New York, and Washington, D.C. metro areas. Asia-Pacific Revenues. Our revenues from Singapore, the largest revenue contributor in this region, represented approximately 35% and 39%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. As in the U.S., Asia-Pacific revenue growth was due to an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX centers, as well as selective price increases in each of our IBX markets. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded $1.7 million of revenues generated from our new IBX center in Tokyo, which we acquired in December 2006, and $1.2 million from our IBX center expansion in Singapore. Europe Revenues. Our revenues from the United Kingdom, the largest revenue contributor in this region, represented approximately 37% of the regional revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007. 42 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, Change 2007 % 2006 % $ % U.S. $ 198,432 75 % $ 165,413 88 % $ 33,019 20 % Asia-Pacific 35,068 13 % 22,966 11 % 12,102 53 % Europe 30,245 12 % — — 30,245 100 % Total $ 263,745 100 % $ 188,379 100 % $ 75,366 40 % Years endedDecember 31, 2007 2006 Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues: U.S. 61 % 67 % Asia-Pacific 61 % 56 % Europe 81 % — Total 63 % 66 % U.S. Cost of Revenues. U.S. cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 included $73.6 million and $65.0 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was due to our IBX center expansion activity. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in U.S. cost of revenues was primarily due to overall growth related to our revenue growth and costs associated with our expansion projects, including (i) $6.0 million of higher compensation costs, (ii) $5.0 million of higher rent and facility costs as a result of IBX center expansion activity and (iii) an increase of $10.3 million in utility costs from increasing customer installations. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 included $9.3 million and $3.5 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was due to our IBX center expansion activity. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily the result of costs associated with our expansion projects and overall growth in connection with revenue growth, such as higher compensation costs, an increase in rent and facility costs and increasing utility and bandwidth costs in line with increasing customer installations and revenues attributed to customer growth. Europe Cost of Revenues. Europe cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $7.6 million of depreciation expense. Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, Change 2007 % 2006 % $ % U.S. $ 31,291 77 % $ 28,052 86 % $ 3,239 12 % Asia-Pacific 6,441 16 % 4,567 14 % 1,874 41 % Europe 2,987 7 % — — 2,987 100 % Total $ 40,719 100 % $ 32,619 100 % $ 8,100 25 % 43 Table of Contents Years endedDecember 31, 2007 2006 Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues: U.S. 10 % 11 % Asia-Pacific 11 % 11 % Europe 8 % — Total 10 % 11 % U.S. Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in U.S. sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to increased sales compensation as a result of revenue growth, including increases in salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to increased sales compensation as a result of revenue growth, including increases in salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation. Europe Sales and Marketing Expenses. Europe sales and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2007 included $1.8 million of intangible asset amortization expense. General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, Change 2007 % 2006 % $ % U.S. $ 83,215 79 % $ 60,645 84 % $ 22,570 37 % Asia-Pacific 14,287 14 % 11,478 16 % 2,809 24 % Europe 8,292 7 % — — 8,292 100 % Total $ 105,794 100 % $ 72,123 100 % $ 33,671 47 % Years endedDecember 31, 2007 2006 General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues: U.S. 26 % 25 % Asia-Pacific 25 % 28 % Europe 22 % — Total 25 % 25 % U.S. General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in U.S. general and administrative expenses was primarily due to $13.4 million of higher compensation costs, including increases in general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (220 U.S. general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2007 versus 175 as of December 31, 2006), an increase of $3.8 million in depreciation expense as a result of our continued investment in information technology systems to support our growth and an increase in professional services due to an increase in various consulting projects in connection with our growth strategies. Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher compensation costs, including increases in general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation. Europe General and Administrative Expenses. Europe general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2007 included $1.1 million of stock-based compensation and depreciation expense. 44 Table of Contents Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a restructuring charge adjustment of $407,000 as a result of revised sublease assumptions for our excess space lease in the Los Angeles metro area as a result of new information becoming available. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a restructuring charge adjustment of $1.5 million as a result of revised sublease assumptions on two of our excess space leases in the New York and Los Angeles metro areas as a result of new information becoming available. The original restructuring charge for these two leases was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 and totaled $17.7 million. We are contractually committed to these two leases through 2015. Gains on Asset Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a $1.3 million gain in connection with the sale of our Equinix mail service offering, which we sold for $1.7 million in gross cash proceeds. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a $9.6 million gain in connection with the sale of our Honolulu IBX center. We sold this IBX center for $9.8 million in gross cash proceeds. Interest Income. Interest income increased to $15.4 million from $6.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Interest income increased due to higher invested balances during these periods, as well as higher yields on those balances due to increased interest rates. The average annualized yield for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 5.08% versus 4.53% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $27.3 million from $14.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to new financings entered into during 2007 and 2006: (i) an additional financing of $40.0 million under the Ashburn campus mortgage payable during the three months ended December 31, 2006, which bears interest at 8.0% per annum, (ii) our $110.0 million Chicago IBX financing, which was drawn down during the construction period of the Chicago metro area IBX expansion project, of which $105.6 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2007 with an approximate interest rate of 8.375% per annum, (iii) our $250.0 million 2.50% convertible subordinated notes offering in March 2007, (iv) our approximately $40.0 million Asia-Pacific financing, of which approximately $25.9 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2007, with an approximate blended interest rate of 3.65% per annum, (v) our $396.0 million 3.00% convertible subordinated notes offering in September 2007 and (vi) our approximately $162.9 million European financing, of which $83.5 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2007 with an approximate blended interest rate of 7.74% per annum. This increase was partially offset by the $54.0 million partial conversion of our 2.50% convertible subordinated debentures in March 2007 that resulted in a decrease in interest expense. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we capitalized $7.7 million and $1.6 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. Other Income (Expense). For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded $3.0 million of other income, primarily consisting of a foreign exchange gain of $1.5 million as a result of hedging a portion of the IXEurope acquisition purchase price with forward contracts and a $621,000 foreign exchange gain related to the liquidation of a wholly-owned subsidiary in the Netherlands. As a result, this historical foreign exchange gain of $621,000, accumulated within other comprehensive income associated with this dormant subsidiary, was recognized in our results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $245,000 of other expense, which was primarily attributable to foreign currency losses during the period. Loss on Conversion and Extinguishment of Debt. In March 2007, we retired $54.0 million of our convertible subordinated debentures in exchange for approximately 1.4 million newly issued shares of our common stock. As a result, we recorded a $3.4 million loss on debt conversion in accordance with FASB No. 84, “Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt,” due to the inducement fee paid. In September 2007, a senior bridge loan was terminated unused and, as a result, we recorded a $2.5 million loss on debt extinguishment reflecting the immediate write-off of capitalized debt issuance costs to secure the senior bridge loan. As a result of these two events, during the year ended December 31, 2007 we recognized a total of $5.9 million of loss on debt conversion and extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we did not record any loss on conversion or extinguishment of debt in our statements of operations. 45 Table of Contents Income Taxes. During 2007, we recorded $473,000 of income tax expense primarily attributable to our foreign operations. During 2006, we recorded $439,000 of income tax expense primarily representing U.S. alternative minimum tax and a net tax benefit from our operations in Singapore, which resulted from the release of the valuation allowance in that jurisdiction. Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle. As a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” during the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a reduction of expense totaling $376,000, which is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on our statement of operations for this period. This amount reflects the application of an estimated forfeiture rate to partially vested employee equity awards as of January 1, 2006 that we accounted for under APB 25, which was primarily for restricted stock awards to our executive officers that were granted during the three months ended March 31, 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2007 no cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was recorded in our statement of operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2008, our total indebtedness was comprised of (i) convertible debt totaling $665.1 million from our convertible subordinated debentures, our 2.50% convertible subordinated notes and our 3.00% convertible subordinated notes and (ii) non-convertible debt and financing obligations totaling $576.0 million from our Washington D.C. metro area IBX capital lease, San Jose IBX equipment and fiber financing, Chicago IBX equipment financing, Los Angeles IBX financing, Paris metro area IBX capital lease, Ashburn campus mortgage payable, Chicago IBX financing, Asia-Pacific financing, European financing, Netherlands financing and other financing obligations. We believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of our current portion of debt due, and complete our publicly announced expansion projects for at least the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2008, we had $307.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded an impairment loss of $1.5 million on our investment in the Reserve Primary Fund, which is referred to as the Reserve, as more fully described in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If the current capital market conditions continue to deteriorate, we may suffer further losses on our investment portfolio, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Besides our investment portfolio and any financing activities we may pursue, customer collections are our primary source of cash. While we believe we have a well diversified customer base with no concentration of credit risk with any single customer, we have a number of large customers in the financial services sector. Further, while we believe we have a strong customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past, if the current market conditions continue to deteriorate our customers may have difficulty paying us, we may experience increased churn in our customer base, and there may be reductions in their commitments to us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. As of December 31, 2008, we had a total of $2.9 million of additional liquidity available to us under the European financing for general working capital and expansion projects in France, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, which we believe we will utilize. In addition, in February 2009, we entered into a $25.0 million one-year revolving credit facility with Bank of America, which will be used to fund our working capital and will enable us to issue letters of credit under the Bank of America credit line (see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). We refer to this transaction as the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line. Our indebtedness as of December 31, 2008, as noted above, consisted of $576.0 million of non-convertible senior debt, of which $251.7 million of this amount was held by a single lender. Although these are committed facilities, most of which are fully drawn or advanced for which we are amortizing debt repayments of either principal and/or interest only, and we are in full compliance with all covenants related to them effective December 31, 2008 (we amended certain provisions in connection with one of our financings related to certain financial covenants effective December 31, 2008), deteriorating market and liquidity conditions may give rise to issues which may impact the lenders’ ability to hold these debt commitments to their full term. 46 Table of Contents While we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our current operating requirements and to complete our publicly-announced IBX expansion plans, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build-out of new IBX centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year. While we will be able to fund some of these expansion plans with our existing resources, additional financing, either debt or equity, may be required to pursue certain of these additional expansion plans. However, if current market conditions continue to persist, or deteriorate further, we may be unable to secure additional financing or any such additional financing may be available to us on unfavorable terms. An inability to pursue additional expansion opportunities will have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our desired level of revenue growth in future periods. Sources and Uses of Cash Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 267,558 $ 120,020 $ 75,412 Net cash used in investing activities (478,040 ) (1,054,725 ) (158,470 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 145,106 1,145,013 46,107 Operating Activities The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to improved operating results as discussed above, strong collections of accounts receivable, management of vendor payments and growth in customer installations, which increases deferred installation revenue. We expect that we will continue to generate cash from our operating activities throughout 2009 and beyond. Investing Activities The significant increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2007 compared to 2008 and 2006 included (i) $541.8 million spent to acquire IXEurope, net of cash acquired, and (ii) $120.5 million spent to acquire real estate properties in San Jose and Los Angeles, California. Excluding these unique and significant events, the changes in our investing activities over the past three years is primarily related to our capital expenditure investment in property, plant and equipment for our IBX center expansion activity, which has increased each year during this three-year period. During the three years ended December 31, 2008, these capital expenditures were $471.1 million, $416.8 million and $162.3 million, respectively. We expect that our IBX expansion activity will decrease during 2009 as we carefully manage investing activities during the current turbulent economy. Financing Activities The significant increase in net cash provided by financing activities during 2007 compared to 2008 and 2006 included approximately $967.0 million of net proceeds raised in a common stock offering and two convertible debt offerings, the majority of which was used to fund the IXEurope acquisition and our IBX center expansion activities. Excluding this significant amount of fundraising in 2007, the changes in our financing activities primarily relate to the net proceeds from our mortgage and notes payable and credit line totaling $123.1 million, $147.5 million and $8.9 million, respectively, for the three years ended December 31, 2008. We expect that, unless we are successful in obtaining new financing, our financing activities will decrease in 2009. In February 2009, we entered into the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line to fund our working capital and enable us to issue letters of credit. 47 Table of Contents Debt Obligations—Convertible Debt Convertible Subordinated Debentures. During February 2004, we sold $86.3 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.50% convertible subordinated debentures due 2024, convertible into 2.2 million shares of our common stock, to qualified institutional buyers. The interest on the convertible subordinated debentures is payable semi-annually every February 15th and August 15th, and commenced in August 2004. The convertible subordinated debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock. Each $1,000 principal amount of convertible subordinated debentures is convertible into 25.3165 shares of our common stock. This represents an initial conversion price of approximately $39.50 per share of common stock. In March 2007, we entered into agreements with the holders of $54.0 million of these convertible subordinated debentures to exchange an aggregate of 1.4 million newly issued shares of our common stock for such holders’ convertible subordinated debentures. The number of shares of common stock issued equals the amount issuable upon conversion of the convertible subordinated debentures in accordance with their original terms. In addition, each holder received cash consideration equal to accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date totaling $110,000, as well as the present value of future interest due through February 15, 2009 and an incremental fee, totaling $3.4 million, as an inducement fee. In November 2008, certain holders of these convertible subordinated debentures converted $13.1 million principal amount of their convertible subordinated debentures into 331,644 newly issued shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2008, a total of $19.2 million convertible subordinated debentures remained outstanding and were convertible into 484,813 shares of our common stock. Holders of the convertible subordinated debentures had the right to require us to purchase all or a portion of these remaining convertible subordinated debentures totaling $19.2 million on February 15, 2009; however, none of them did so. In addition, in December 2008, due to a combination of factors, including the fact that the small number of convertible subordinated debentures remaining outstanding has resulted in small and infrequent trades of the convertible subordinated debentures creating an illiquid market and the depressed price of our common stock during this period, the parity provision clause (see “Convertible Subordinated Debentures” in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) was triggered. As a result, as of December 31, 2008, holders of the convertible subordinated debentures have the right to convert their individual debentures into shares of our common stock at any time. Therefore, we have reclassified the remaining convertible subordinated debentures as a current liability as of December 31, 2008. 2.50% Convertible Subordinated Notes. In March 2007, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.50% convertible subordinated notes due 2012. The interest on the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes is payable semi-annually every April 15th and October 15th, and commenced in October 2007. The initial conversion rate is 8.9259 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. This represents an initial conversion price of approximately $112.03 per share of common stock or 2.2 million shares of our common stock. Upon conversion, holders will receive, at our election, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. Holders of the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes may convert their notes under certain defined circumstances, including during any fiscal quarter (and only during that fiscal quarter) ending after June 30, 2007, if the sale price of our common stock, for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter, is greater than 130% of the conversion price per share of common stock on such last trading day, which was $145.64 per share as of December 31, 2008. In addition, holders of the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes may convert their individual notes at any time on or after March 15, 2012. We may redeem all or a portion of the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes at any time after April 16, 2010 for cash but only if the closing sale price of our common stock for at least 20 of the 30 consecutive trading days immediately prior to the day we give notice of redemption is greater than 130% of the applicable conversion price per share of common stock on the date of the notice, which was $145.64 per share as of December 31, 2008. The redemption price will equal 100% of the principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. 48 Table of Contents Upon conversion, due to the conversion formulas associated with the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes, if our stock is trading at levels exceeding 130% of the conversion price per share of common stock, and if we elect to pay any portion of the consideration in cash, additional consideration beyond the $250.0 million of gross proceeds received would be required. However, in no event would the total number of shares issuable upon conversion of the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes exceed 11.6036 per $1,000 principal amount of convertible subordinated notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, or the equivalent of $86.18 per share of common stock or a total of 2.9 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2008, the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes were convertible into 2.2 million shares of our common stock. The 2.50% convertible subordinated notes fall under the scope of a new accounting pronouncement, FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, “Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion,” applicable to us commencing in 2009. For further information, refer to “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 3.00% Convertible Subordinated Notes. In September 2007, we issued $396.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Convertible Subordinated Notes due October 15, 2014. Interest is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, and commenced in April 2008. Holders of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes may convert their notes at their option on any day up to and including the business day immediately preceding the maturity date into shares of our common stock. The base conversion rate is 7.436 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. This represents a base conversion price of approximately $134.48 per share of common stock. If, at the time of conversion, the applicable stock price of our common stock exceeds the base conversion price, the conversion rate will be determined pursuant to a formula resulting in the receipt of up to 4.4616 additional shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. However, in no event would the total number of shares issuable upon conversion of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes exceed 11.8976 per $1,000 principal amount of 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, or the equivalent of $84.05 per share of our common stock or a total of 4.7 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2008, the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes were convertible into 2.9 million shares of our common stock. Debt Obligations—Non-Convertible Debt Capital Lease and Other Financing Obligations Washington D.C. Metro Area IBX Capital Lease. In April 2004, we entered into a long-term lease for a 95,000 square foot data center in the Washington, D.C. metro area. The center is adjacent to our existing Washington D.C. metro area IBX center. This lease, which includes the leasing of all of the IBX plant and machinery equipment located in the building, is a capital lease. We took possession of this property during the fourth quarter of 2004, and as a result, recorded property, plant and equipment assets, as well as a capital lease obligation, totaling $35.3 million. Payments under this lease will be made monthly through October 2019 at an effective interest rate of 8.50% per annum. As of December 31, 2008, principal of $31.5 million remained outstanding under this capital lease. San Jose IBX Equipment and Fiber Financing. In December 2004, we entered into a long-term lease for a 103,000 square foot data center in San Jose, and at the same time entered into separate agreements to purchase the equipment located within this new IBX center and to interconnect all three of our Silicon Valley area IBX centers to each other through redundant dark fiber links. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, these three separate agreements were considered to be a single arrangement. Furthermore, while the building component of this transaction is classified as a long-term operating lease, the equipment and fiber portions of the transaction were classified as financed assets. We took possession of this property during the first quarter of 2005, and as a result, recorded property, plant and equipment and prepaid fiber assets, as well as a financing 49 Table of Contents obligation, totaling $18.7 million. Payments under this financing obligation will be made monthly through May 2020 at an effective interest rate of 8.50% per annum. As of December 31, 2008, principal of $14.2 million remained outstanding under this financing obligation. Chicago IBX Equipment Financing. In July 2005, we entered into a long-term sublease for a 107,000 square foot data center in Chicago, and at the same time entered into a separate agreement to purchase the equipment located within this IBX center. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, these two separate agreements were considered to be a single arrangement. Furthermore, while the building component of this transaction is classified as a long-term operating lease, the equipment portion of the transaction is classified as financed assets. We took possession of this property and title to the equipment assets in November 2005, and as a result, recorded IBX equipment assets, as well as a financing obligation, totaling $9.7 million at that time. Payments under this financing obligation will be made monthly through August 2015 at an effective interest rate of 7.50% per annum. As of December 31, 2008, principal of $6.9 million remained outstanding under this financing obligation. Los Angeles IBX Financing. In September 2005, we purchased a 107,000 square foot data center in the Los Angeles metro area for $34.7 million, which we paid for in full with cash in September 2005. In October 2005, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell this Los Angeles IBX for $38.7 million and to lease it back from the purchaser pursuant to a long-term lease, which closed in December 2005, and we received net proceeds from the sale of this property of $38.1 million. However, due to our continuing involvement concerning certain aspects of this property, the sale and leaseback of this property does not qualify as a sale-leaseback under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, but rather is accounted for as a financing of the property. We refer to this portion of the transaction as the Los Angeles IBX financing. Pursuant to the Los Angeles IBX financing, we recorded a financing obligation liability totaling $38.1 million in December 2005. Payments under the Los Angeles IBX financing will be made monthly through December 2025 at an effective interest rate of 7.75% per annum. As of December 31, 2008, principal of $37.7 million remained outstanding under this financing obligation. Paris Metro Area IBX Capital Lease. In September 2008, we entered into a long-term lease for 10,850 square meters of vacant space within a warehouse building in the Paris metro area. The center is adjacent to one of our existing Paris metro area IBX centers. This lease is a capital lease and commenced on October 1, 2008. We took possession of this property during the fourth quarter of 2008, and as a result, recorded property, plant and equipment assets, as well as a capital lease obligation, totaling $39.3 million. Monthly payments under this lease commencing in April 2009 will be made through September 2020 at an effective interest rate of 7.43% per annum. As of December 31, 2008, principal of $40.0 million remained outstanding under this capital lease. Other Capital Lease and Financing Obligations. We have various other capital leases and financing obligations under which principal of $7.2 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2008. Mortgage and Loans Payable Ashburn Campus Mortgage Payable. In December 2005, we completed the financing of our October 2005 purchase of the Ashburn campus property with a $60.0 million mortgage to be amortized over 20 years. Upon receipt of the $60.0 million of cash in December 2005, we recorded a $60.0 million mortgage payable. Payments under the Ashburn campus mortgage payable will be made monthly through January 2026 at an effective interest rate of 8.1% per annum. In December 2006, we obtained an additional financing of $40.0 million under the Ashburn campus mortgage payable, which increased the total amount financed under the Ashburn campus mortgage payable to $100.0 million, on the same terms as the initial mortgage payable. As of December 31, 2008, principal of $94.4 million remained outstanding under this mortgage payable. Chicago IBX Financing. In February 2007, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries obtained a loan of up to $110.0 million to finance up to 60% of the development and construction costs of the Chicago metro area IBX 50 Table of Contents expansion project, which we refer to as the Chicago IBX financing. Funds were advanced at up to 60% of project costs incurred. As of December 31, 2008, we had received advances representing a final loan payable totaling $110.0 million. The loan payable has an initial maturity date of January 31, 2010, with options to extend for up to an additional two years, in one-year increments, upon satisfaction of certain extension conditions. The loan payable bears interest at a floating rate (one, three or six month LIBOR plus 2.75%) with interest payable monthly, which commenced in March 2007. As of December 31, 2008, the loan payable had an approximate interest rate of 4.19% per annum. The Chicago IBX financing has no specific financial covenants, contains a limited parent company guaranty and is collateralized by the assets of one of our Chicago IBX centers. In May 2008, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with one counterparty to hedge the interest payments on principal of $105.0 million of the Chicago IBX financing, which will mature in February 2011. Under the terms of the interest rate swap transaction, we receive interest payments based on rolling one-month LIBOR terms and pay interest at the fixed interest rate of 6.34% (swap rate of 3.59% plus borrowing margin of 2.75%). Asia-Pacific Financing. In August 2007, two of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, located in Singapore and Tokyo, Japan, entered into an approximately $48.4 million multi-currency credit facility agreement (using the exchange rates as of December 31, 2008), which is comprised of 23.0 million Singapore dollars and 2.9 billion Japanese yen, respectively. In January 2008, the Asia-Pacific financing was amended to enable our subsidiary in Australia to borrow up to 32.0 million Australian dollars, or approximately $22.5 million (using the exchange rate as of December 31, 2008), under the same general terms, amending the Asia-Pacific financing into an approximately $70.9 million multi-currency credit facility agreement. In June 2008, the Asia-Pacific financing was further amended to enable our subsidiary in Hong Kong to borrow up to 156.0 million Hong Kong dollars, or approximately $20.1 million (using the exchange rate as of December 31, 2008), under the same general terms, amending the Asia-Pacific financing into an approximately $91.0 million multi-currency credit facility agreement. The Asia-Pacific financing has a four-year term that allows these four subsidiaries to borrow up to their credit limits during the first 12-month period with repayment to occur over the remaining three years in 12 equal quarterly installments. The Asia-Pacific financing bears interest at a floating rate (the relevant three-month local cost of funds), as applicable, plus 1.85%-2.50% depending on the ratio of our senior indebtedness to our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, with interest payable quarterly. Loans payable under the Asia-Pacific financing have a final maturity date of June 2012. The Asia-Pacific financing may be used by these four subsidiaries to fund capital expenditures on leasehold improvements, equipment, and other installation costs related to expansion plans in Singapore, Tokyo, Sydney and Hong Kong. The Asia-Pacific financing is guaranteed by the parent company and is secured by the assets of these four subsidiaries, including a pledge of their shares, and has several financial covenants specific to our Asia-Pacific operations with which we must comply quarterly. As of December 31, 2008, we had fully drawn the Asia-Pacific financing and a total of $87.0 million was outstanding under the Asia-Pacific financing at an approximate blended interest rate of 3.69%. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in connection with the Asia-Pacific financing. European Financing. In September 2007, as a result of the IXEurope acquisition, our wholly-owned subsidiary acquired a senior facilities agreement totaling approximately 82.0 million British pounds, or approximately $135.5 million (using the exchange rate as of December 31, 2008). The European financing is comprised of three facilities: (i) Facility A, which was available to draw upon through March 2008, provides for a term loan of up to approximately 40.0 million British pounds and bears a floating interest rate per annum of between 0.875% and 2.25% above LIBOR or EURIBOR; (ii) Facility B, which was available to draw upon through June 2010, provides for a term loan of up to approximately 40.0 million British pounds and bears a floating interest rate per annum of between 0.875% and 2.25% above LIBOR or EURIBOR and (iii) Facility C, which is available to draw upon through May 2014, provides for a revolving credit facility of up to approximately 2.0 million British pounds and bears a floating interest rate per annum of between 0.875% and 2.125% above LIBOR or EURIBOR. The European financing has a final maturity date of June 30, 2014 and interest is payable in periods of one, two, three or six months at our election. Facility A will be repaid in 13 semi- 51 Table of Contents annual installments, which commenced June 30, 2008. Facility B will be repaid in nine semi-annual installments commencing June 30, 2010. Facility C will be repaid at the final maturity date. The European financing is available to fund our subsidiary’s current or future operations in Europe, including capital expenditures, for certain approved subsidiaries in Europe, and amounts can be drawn in British pounds, Euros or Swiss francs. The European financing is collateralized by certain of our assets in Europe and contains several financial covenants specific to our European operations with which we must comply quarterly. In January 2009, we amended certain provisions of the European financing related to certain financial covenants and acknowledgment of the appointment of an executive officer in Europe, which were effective December 31, 2008. As a result of this amendment, we are in compliance with all financial covenants in connection with the European financing. Upon a written request from us at any time after December 31, 2007 and through the final maturity date, and upon approval by the lenders, an additional term loan of up to 15.0 million British pounds, or approximately $21.9 million, may be made available to us. The European financing requires us to hedge the floating interest rates inherent in the European financing (on just a portion of the total amounts outstanding). As of December 31, 2008, approximately $131.0 million was outstanding under the European financing at an approximate blended interest rate of 4.39% per annum as we had fully utilized Facility A and Facility B, leaving 2.0 million British pounds of Facility C, or approximately $2.9 million, available to borrow under the European financing. In May 2008, we entered into three interest rate swap agreements and re-designated two older ineffective interest rate swap agreements with a total of two counterparties to hedge the interest payments on the equivalent principal of $101.0 million of the European financing, which will mature in August 2009 and May 2011. Under the terms of the interest rate swap transactions, we receive interest payments based on rolling one-month EURIBOR and LIBOR terms and pay fixed interest rates ranging from 5.97% to 8.16% (swap rates ranging from 3.72% to 5.91% plus borrowing margin). Netherlands Financing. In February 2008, as a result of the Virtu acquisition, our wholly-owned subsidiary assumed senior credit facilities totaling approximately 5.5 million Euros, which are callable by the lender and bear interest at a floating rate (three month EURIBOR plus 1.25%). As of December 31, 2008, a total of 4.6 million Euros, or approximately $6.5 million, was outstanding under the Netherlands financing with an approximate blended interest rate of 4.18% per annum. The Netherlands financing is collateralized by substantially all of our operations in the Netherlands. The Netherlands financing contains several financial covenants specific to our operations in the Netherlands, which must be complied with on an annual basis. As of December 31, 2008, our wholly-owned subsidiary in the Netherlands was not in compliance with certain of the financial covenants; however, the lender agreed to waive such non-compliance while we renegotiate the entire Netherlands financing, which should be completed by April 2009. If we are unable to renegotiate the Netherlands financing by April 2009, the financial covenants in their original form will go back into effect. Although the Netherlands financing has a payment schedule with a final payment date in January 2016, as of December 31, 2008, we had reflected the total amount outstanding of $6.5 million under the Netherlands financing as a current liability within the current portion of mortgage and loans payable on the accompanying balance sheet as it is not currently a committed facility (it is callable by the lender). Other Note Payable. The other note payable arises from a 2005 lease restructuring and is a non-interest bearing note with an imputed interest rate of 6.14% per annum. Payments under the other note payable, which originally totaled $20.0 million, are payable quarterly and will be payable through the fourth quarter of 2009. As of December 31, 2008, $9.7 million was outstanding under the other note payable. 52 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrrangements We lease a majority of our IBX centers and certain equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements expiring through 2027. The following represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 (in thousands): 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 andthereafter Total Convertible debt (1) $ 19,150 $ — $ — $ 250,000 $ $ 395,986 $ 665,136 Chicago IBX financing (1) — 109,991 (5) — — — — 109,991 Asia-Pacific financing (1) 25,121 30,348 26,312 5,228 — — 87,009 European financing (1) 8,170 14,895 16,530 19,892 23,977 47,517 130,981 Netherlands financing (1) 6,485 — — — — — 6,485 Interest (2) 31,530 25,447 23,305 17,538 14,772 10,458 123,050 Mortgage payable (3) 10,164 10,164 10,164 10,165 10,165 123,338 174,160 Other note payable (3) 10,000 — — — — — 10,000 Capital lease and other financing obligations (3) 15,242 16,562 16,810 16,695 16,785 138,595 220,689 Operating leases under accrued restructuring charges (3) 4,779 4,871 5,024 5,296 5,397 8,346 33,713 Operating leases (4) 52,077 49,578 45,598 44,583 44,391 197,434 433,661 Other contractual commitments (4) 228,586 23,467 5,375 2,201 2,200 29,376 291,205 $ 411,304 $ 285,323 $ 149,118 $ 371,598 $ 117,687 $ 951,050 $ 2,286,080 (1) Represents principal only.

(3) Represents principal and interest. (4) Represents off-balance sheet arrangements. Other contractual commitments are described below. (5) The loan payable under the Chicago IBX financing has an initial maturity date of January 31, 2010, with options to extend for up to an additional two years, in one-year increments, upon satisfaction of certain extension conditions. Given the current market climate, we intend to extend the maturity of the loan payable under the Chicago IBX financing. Primarily as a result of our various IBX expansion projects, as of December 31, 2008, we were contractually committed for $174.9 million of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for IBX equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided, in connection with the work necessary to open these IBX centers prior to making them available to customers for installation. This amount, which is expected to be paid during 2009 and 2010, is reflected in the table above as “other contractual commitments.” We have other, non-capital purchase commitments in place as of December 31, 2008, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations, primarily in the U.S., Singapore and the United Kingdom, through 2009 and thereafter, and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods or services to be delivered or provided during 2009. Such other purchase commitments as of December 31, 2008, which total $80.0 million, are also reflected in the table above as “other contractual commitments.” Additionally, in October 2008, we entered into an agreement for lease for a property located in the London metro area, which is currently being developed by the landlord. Upon completion of the property development, which is expected to occur in November 2009, we will enter into a lease for this property for 20 years. This commitment to lease, which totals approximately $36.3 million, is also reflected in the table above as “other contractual commitments.” 53 Table of Contents In addition, although we are not contractually obligated to do so, we expect to incur additional capital expenditures beyond the $174.9 million contractually committed as of December 31, 2008 in our various IBX expansion projects during 2009 and thereafter of approximately $100.0 million to $150.0 million in order to complete the work needed to open these IBX centers. These non-contractual capital expenditures are not reflected in the table above. Other Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements We have various guarantor arrangements with both our directors and officers and third parties, including customers, vendors and business partners (see “Guarantor Arrangements” in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). As of December 31, 2008, there were no liabilities recorded for these arrangements. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following critical accounting estimates, among others, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require significant judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain: • Accounting for income taxes; • Accounting for impairment of goodwill; and • Accounting for property, plant and equipment. 54 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid. SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined by SFAS No. 109 as a likelihood of more than 50 percent) such assets will not be realized. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future events. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. If, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account a number of types of evidence, including the following: 1) the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, 2) sources of future taxable income and 3) tax planning strategies. As of December 31, 2008, we had total net deferred tax assets of $98.6 million. As of December 31, 2007, we had total net deferred tax liabilities of $19.6 million. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had a total valuation allowance of $40.3 million and $163.1 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we decided to release our valuation allowances associated with our U.S. and Australian operations, which resulted in an income tax benefit of $101.9 million and $6.1 million, respectively, in our results of operations for this period. We believe that both our U.S. and Australian operations have achieved a sufficient level of profitability and will sustain a sufficient level of profitability in 2009 and beyond to support the release of these valuation allowances based on current facts and circumstances. However, if our assumptions on the future performance of these regions prove not to be correct and these regions are not able to sustain a sufficient level of profitability to support the associated deferred tax assets on our balance sheet, we will have to impair our deferred tax assets through an additional valuation allowance, which would impact our financial position and results of operations in the period such a determination is made. Our remaining valuation allowance as of December 31, 2008 relates to certain of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. Once we release our remaining valuation allowance, it will have an impact to our financial position and results of operations in the periods such a determination is made. We will continue to assess the need for our valuation allowances, by country or location, in the future. 55 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Accounting for Impairment of Goodwill In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” we perform goodwill impairment reviews annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we completed annual goodwill impairment reviews of both the Europe reporting unit and the Asia-Pacific reporting unit and concluded that there was no impairment as the fair value of both reporting units exceeded their carrying value. We use both the income and market approach in step one of our goodwill impairment reviews and weight the results of both equally. Under the income approach, we develop a five-year cash flow forecast and use our weighted-average cost of capital applicable to our reporting units as discount rates. This requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. These assumptions require significant management judgment and are inherently subject to uncertainties. Future events, changing market conditions and any changes in key assumptions may result in an impairment charge. While we have never recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill to date, the development of adverse business conditions in our Asia-Pacific or European reporting units, such as higher than anticipated customer churn or significantly increased operating costs, or significant deterioration of our market comparables that we use in the market approach, could result in an impairment charge in future periods. As of December 31, 2008, goodwill attributable to the Asia-Pacific reporting unit and the Europe reporting unit was $18.2 million and $325.0 million, respectively. Any potential impairment charge against our goodwill would not exceed the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. 56 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Accounting for Property, Plant and Equipment We have a substantial amount of property, plant and equipment recorded on our balance sheet. The vast majority of our property, plant and equipment represent the costs incurred to build out or acquire our IBX centers around the world. Our IBX centers are long-lived assets. The majority of our IBX centers are in properties that are leased. We depreciate our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (subject to the term of the lease in the case of leased assets or leasehold improvements). Accounting for property, plant and equipment involves a number of accounting issues including determining the appropriate period in which to depreciate such assets, making assessments for leased properties to determine whether they are capital or operating leases, capitalizing interest during periods of construction and assessing the initial asset retirement obligations required for certain leased properties that require us to return the leased properties back to their original condition at the time we decide to exit a leased property. While there are numerous judgments and uncertainties involved in accounting for property, plant and equipment that are significant, arriving at the estimated useful life of an asset requires the most critical judgment for us and changes to these estimates would have the most significant impact to our financial position and results of operations. In many cases, we arrived at these estimates during 1999 when we opened our first three IBX centers. When we lease a property for our IBX centers, we generally enter into long-term arrangements with initial lease terms of at least 8-10 years and with renewal options available to us. During the next several years, a number of leases for our IBX centers will start to come up for renewal. As we start approaching the ends of these initial lease terms, we will need to reassess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment. In addition, we may find that our estimates for the useful lives of non-leased assets may also need to be revised. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had property, plant and equipment of $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, and for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recorded depreciation expense of $152.8 million, $97.9 million and $71.7 million, respectively. A change in our estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment could have a significant impact to our results of operations. For example, in the U.S. alone, if we extended by five years the estimated remaining useful lives of just our leasehold improvements and IBX plant and machinery, the two largest sub-components of our property, plant and equipment, it would have resulted in approximately $22.6 million less of depreciation expense during 2008. This is presented simply as an example of how a change in an estimated useful life assumption could impact our results of operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk The following discussion about market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to impairments of our investment portfolio, changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity. 57 Table of Contents We currently employ interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging certain specifically-identified exposures. The use of these financial instruments is intended to mitigate some of the risks associated with either fluctuations in interest rates or currency exchange rates, but does not eliminate such risks. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Investment Portfolio Risk All of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale and are therefore recorded at fair market value on our consolidated balance sheets with the unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income or loss. We consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge for our securities, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. As more fully described in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in September 2008, we incurred a realized loss from our investment portfolio (consisting of a single money market account) totaling $1.5 million. If market conditions continue to deteriorate and liquidity constraints become even more pronounced, we could sustain more losses from our investment portfolio. As our securities mature, we have been increasing our holdings in U.S. government securities, such as Treasury bills and Treasury notes of a short-term duration and lower yield. As a result, we expect our interest income to decrease in future periods. As of December 31, 2008, our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market fund investments, commercial paper, corporate bonds, asset backed securities, certificates of deposit and U.S government and agency obligations. Excluding the U.S. government holdings which carry a lower risk and lower return in comparison to other securities in the portfolio, the remaining amount in our investment portfolio that could be more susceptible to market risk totaled $176.9 million. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and variable-rate financings in place in the U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific. The fair market value of our marketable securities could be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, but we do not believe such impact would be material. Securities with longer maturities are subject to a greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities and as of December 31, 2008 our portfolio maturity was relatively short. If current interest rates were to increase or decrease by 10% from their position as of December 31, 2008, the fair market value of our investment portfolio could increase or decrease by approximately $93,000. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates from their position as of December 31, 2008 would not have a material impact on our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of the majority of our debt obligations. However, the interest expense associated with our Chicago IBX financing, Asia-Pacific financing, European financing and Netherlands financing, which bear interest at variable rates tied to local cost of funds or LIBOR/SIBOR/EURIBOR, could be affected. For every 100 basis point change in interest rates, our annual interest expense could increase or decrease by a total of approximately $3.3 million based on the total balance of our borrowings under the Chicago IBX financing, Asia-Pacific financing, European financing and Netherlands financing as of December 31, 2008. To mitigate the risk of fluctuations in floating rates, we utilize interest rate swaps (receive floating/pay fixed). As of December 31, 2008, we had entered into a total of six swap agreements with maturity dates of less than three years, comprised of five swap agreements for the European financing with an aggregate notional amount of 38.3 million British pounds and 32.3 million Euros, or approximately $101.0 million, and one swap agreement for the Chicago IBX financing with an aggregate notional amount of $105.0 million. Under the five swap agreements for the European financing, we pay fixed interest rates ranging from 5.97% to 8.16% (swap rates ranging from 3.72% to 5.91% plus borrowing margin) on the notional amount and the counterparty pays us rates of interest on the notional amount based on LIBOR/EURIBOR. Under the swap agreement for the Chicago IBX financing, we pay a fixed interest rate of 6.34% (swap rate of 3.59% plus 58 Table of Contents borrowing margin of 2.75%) on the notional amount and the counterparty pays us rates of interest on the notional amount based on one-month LIBOR. The fair values or changes in fair value of these swaps are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. The fair value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate changes may affect the fair value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair value of our convertible subordinated debentures and convertible subordinated notes is based on quoted market prices. The following represents the estimated fair value of our convertible debt as of December 31, 2008 (in thousands): CarryingValue Fair Value Convertible subordinated debentures $ 19,150 $ 19,290 2.50% convertible subordinated notes 250,000 175,000 3.00% convertible subordinated notes 395,986 251,451 We may enter into additional interest rate hedging agreements in the future to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk. Foreign Currency Risk The majority of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, generated mostly from customers in the U.S. However, approximately 37% of our revenues and 41% of our operating costs are attributable to the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions and a large portion of those revenues and costs are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound, Euro, Swiss franc, Singapore dollar, Japanese yen and Hong Kong and Australian dollars. As a result, our operating results and cash flows are impacted by currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. To protect against certain reductions in value caused by changes in currency exchange rates, we have established a risk management program to offset some of the risk of carrying assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency. As a result, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Our risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements and its impact to the statements of operations. As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of one year or less. For the foreseeable future, we anticipate that approximately 35-45% of our revenues and operating costs will continue to be generated and incurred outside of the U.S. in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. While we hedge certain of our balance sheet foreign currency assets and liabilities, we do not hedge revenue. During fiscal 2007 and the first half of 2008, the U.S. dollar had been generally weaker relative to the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate. This overall weakness of the U.S. dollar had a positive impact on our consolidated results of operations because the foreign denominations translated into more U.S. dollars. However, during the last several months of 2008, the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate. This has significantly impacted our consolidated financial position and results of operations as amounts in foreign currencies are generally translating into less U.S. dollars. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens further, this will continue to have a significant impact to our consolidated financial position and results of operations including the amount of revenue that we report in future periods. For example, while our European operations incurred revenue growth in local currencies during the fourth quarter of 2008, as compared to the third quarter of 2008, of approximately 11%, when translated to U.S. dollars, our European operations reported a quarter to quarter decline in revenues of 4%. We may enter into additional hedging activities in the future to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency risk as our exposure to foreign currency risk continues to increase due to our growing foreign operations; however, we do not currently intend to eliminate all foreign currency transaction exposure. 59 Table of Contents Commodity Price Risk Certain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of price changes are electricity, supplies and equipment used in our IBX centers. We closely monitor the cost of electricity at all of our locations. We have entered into several power contracts to purchase power at fixed prices during 2009 and beyond in certain locations in the U.S., as well as Australia, Germany, Singapore and the United Kingdom. In addition, as we are building new, “greenfield” IBX centers, we are subject to commodity price risk for building materials related to the construction of these IBX centers, such as steel and copper. In addition, the lead-time to procure certain pieces of equipment, such as generators, is substantial. Any delays in procuring the necessary pieces of equipment for the construction of our IBX centers could delay the anticipated openings of these new IBX centers and, as a result, increase the cost of these projects. We do not currently employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to address commodity price risk other than the power contracts discussed above.",2023-12-30 20:28:04.057862
1101239,EQIX,EQUINIX INC,2010,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information in this discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements are based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. For example, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist readers in understanding our financial information from our management’s perspective and is presented as follows: • Overview • Results of Operations • Non-GAAP Financial Measures • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements • Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates • Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2009, we adopted a FASB standard for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) and a FASB standard for instruments granted in share-based payment transactions that are considered participating securities and, therefore, should be included in the calculation of earnings per share, or EPS. These FASB standards were applied retrospectively; as a result, we adjusted our previously issued comparative consolidated financial statements. See “Adoption of Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Adjusted Consolidated Financial Statements” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we assessed and changed the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment. This change is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis effective July 1, 2009. See “Property, Plant and Equipment” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In October 2009, as more fully described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire Switch and Data, which operates 34 data centers in the U.S. and Canada. We refer to this transaction as the Switch and Data acquisition. The Switch and Data acquisition, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2010, subject to regulatory approval, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as amended, as well as the satisfaction or waiver of closing conditions, will have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 35 Table of Contents Overview Equinix provides global data center services that protect and connect the word’s most valued information assets. Global enterprises, financial services companies, and content and network service providers rely upon Equinix’s leading insight and our 49 data centers in 18 markets around the world for the safeguarding of their critical IT equipment and the ability to directly connect to the networks that enable today’s information-driven economy. Equinix offers the following data center services: premium data center colocation, interconnection and exchange services, and outsourced IT infrastructure services. As of December 31, 2009, we operated IBX data centers in the Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. metro areas in the United States; France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom in Europe; and Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore in Asia-Pacific. We entered Europe in September 2007 through our acquisition of IXEurope Plc, or IXEurope, headquartered in London, U.K. We refer to this transaction as the IXEurope acquisition. In February 2008, we acquired Virtu Secure Webservices B.V., or Virtu, based in the Netherlands, to supplement our European operations. We refer to this transaction as the Virtu acquisition. In July 2009, we acquired Upminster GmbH, or Upminster, based in Germany, to further supplement our European operations. We refer to this transaction as the Upminster acquisition. We leverage our global data centers in 18 markets around the world as a global service delivery platform which serves more than 90% of the world’s Internet routes and allows our customers to increase information and application delivery performance while significantly reducing costs. Based on our global delivery platform and the quality of our IBX data centers, we believe we have established a critical mass of customers. As more customers locate in our IBX data centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate as well in order to gain the full economic and performance benefits of our services. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a “marketplace” for their services. Our global delivery platform enables scalable, reliable and cost-effective colocation, interconnection and traffic exchange thus lowering overall cost and increasing flexibility. Our focused business model is based on our critical mass of customers and the resulting “marketplace” effect. This global delivery platform, combined with our strong financial position, continues to drive new customer growth and bookings as we drive scale into our global business. Historically, our market has been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled their telecommunications products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center services market landscape has evolved to include cloud computing/utility providers, application hosting providers and systems integrators, managed infrastructure hosting providers and colocation providers with over 350 companies providing data center services in the United States alone. Each of these data center services providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network services, and outsourced IT infrastructure services. We are able to offer our customers a global platform that supports global reach to 10 countries, proven operational reliability, improved application performance and network choice, and a highly scalable set of services. Our customer count increased to 2,612 as of December 31, 2009 versus 2,272 as of December 31, 2008, an increase of 15%. Our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus net sellable cabinet space available taking into account power limitations. Our utilization rate decreased to 79% as of December 31, 2009 versus approximately 81% as of December 31, 2008; however, excluding the impact of our IBX data center expansion projects that have opened during the last 12 months, our utilization rate would have increased to approximately 85% as of December 31, 2009. Our utilization rate varies from market to market among our IBX data centers across the U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific regions. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain of our high power demand customers. This increased power consumption has driven the requirement to build out our new IBX data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX data centers. We could face power limitations in our centers 36 Table of Contents even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific IBX data center. This could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows. Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and service offerings such as our recent announcement of our agreement to acquire Switch and Data. As was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors such as demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to break-even and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. Depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements, in order to bring these properties up to Equinix standards. Property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant. Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation, interconnection and managed infrastructure services. We consider these services recurring as our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years and during the past three years, in any given quarter, greater than half of our monthly recurring revenue bookings come from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer’s initial deployment and professional services that we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring as they are billed typically once and upon completion of the installation or professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. However, revenues from installation services are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the term of the related contract or expected life of the services. As a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future. Our U.S. revenues are derived primarily from colocation and interconnection services while our Europe and Asia-Pacific revenues are derived primarily from colocation and managed infrastructure services. The largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX data centers, utility costs, including electricity and bandwidth, IBX data center employees’ salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment and security services. A substantial majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing IBX data centers or open or acquire new IBX data centers. However, there are certain costs which are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies, that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. We expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will increase in the future on a per-unit or fixed basis in addition to the variable increase related to the growth of consumption by the customer. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months as compared to other times of the year. To the extent we incur increased electricity costs as a result of either climate change policies or the physical effects of climate change, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer contract intangible assets. 37 Table of Contents General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees, and other general corporate expenses such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and some depreciation expense. Due to our recurring revenue model, and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature and generally does not grow in proportion to revenue growth, we expect our cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses to decline as a percentage of revenue over time, although we expect each of them to grow in absolute dollars in connection with our growth. This is evident in the trends noted below in our discussion on our results of operations. However, for cost of revenues, this trend may periodically be impacted when a large expansion project opens or is acquired and before it starts generating any meaningful revenue. Furthermore, in relation to cost of revenues, we note that the U.S. region has a lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue than either Europe or Asia-Pacific. This is due to both the increased scale and maturity of the U.S. region compared to either Europe or Asia-Pacific, as well as a higher cost structure outside of the U.S., particularly in Europe. While we expect all three regions to continue to see lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in future periods, we expect the trend of the U.S. having the lowest cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue and Europe having the highest to continue. As a result, to the extent that revenue growth outside the U.S. grows in greater proportion than revenue growth in the U.S., our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may increase slightly in future periods. Results of Operations Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 include the operations of IXEurope from September 14, 2007 to December 31, 2007. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 include the operations of Virtu from February 5, 2008 to December 31, 2008. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 include the operations of Upminster from July 22, 2009 to December 31, 2009. Years Ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, Change 2009 % 2008 % $ % U.S: Recurring revenues $ 515,780 59 % $ 423,940 60 % $ 91,840 22 % Non-recurring revenues 19,709 2 % 18,863 3 % 846 4 % 535,489 61 % 442,803 63 % 92,686 21 % Europe: Recurring revenues 212,635 24 % 165,669 24 % 46,966 28 % Non-recurring revenues 15,501 2 % 11,833 1 % 3,668 31 % 228,136 26 % 177,502 25 % 50,634 29 % Asia-Pacific: Recurring revenues 113,434 12 % 77,554 11 % 35,880 46 % Non-recurring revenues 5,450 1 % 6,821 1 % (1,371 ) (20 )% 118,884 13 % 84,375 12 % 34,509 41 % Total: Recurring revenues 841,849 95 % 667,163 95 % 174,686 26 % Non-recurring revenues 40,660 5 % 37,517 5 % 3,143 8 % $ 882,509 100 % $ 704,680 100 % $ 177,829 25 % 38 Table of Contents U.S. Revenues. The period over period growth in recurring revenues was primarily the result of an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers, as well as selective price increases in each of our IBX markets. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded $67.7 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Chicago, Los Angeles and New York metro areas. We expect that our U.S. revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in these recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions and additional expansions currently taking place in the Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. metro areas, which are expected to open during 2010. Europe Revenues. Our revenues from the United Kingdom, the largest revenue contributor in the Europe region, represented approximately 36% and 38%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. As in the U.S., Europe revenue growth was due to an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded approximately $49.4 million of revenue from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris metro areas. We expect that our Europe revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions and additional expansions currently taking place in the Geneva, London, Paris and Zurich metro areas, which are expected to open during the first half of 2010. Asia-Pacific Revenues. Our revenues from Singapore, the largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, represented approximately 36% and 38%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. As in the U.S., Asia-Pacific revenue growth was due to an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers, as well as selective price increases in each of our IBX markets. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded approximately $25.7 million of revenue generated from our IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Hong Kong, Singapore and Sydney metro areas. The decrease in Asia-Pacific non-recurring revenue was primarily due to higher revenue from equipment resales in 2008. We expect that our Asia-Pacific revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in these recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, Change 2009 % 2008 % $ % U.S. $ 269,242 56 % $ 238,583 57 % $ 30,659 13 % Europe 144,875 30 % 122,658 30 % 22,217 18 % Asia-Pacific 69,303 14 % 53,558 13 % 15,745 29 % Total $ 483,420 100 % $ 414,799 100 % $ 68,621 17 % Years endedDecember 31, 2009 2008 Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues: U.S. 50 % 54 % Europe 64 % 69 % Asia-Pacific 58 % 63 % Total 55 % 59 % 39 Table of Contents U.S. Cost of Revenues. U.S. cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 included $99.3 million and $91.9 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense of $14.5 million was due to our IBX data center expansion activity; however, this growth was partially offset by a $7.1 million decrease in depreciation expense as we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2009. Excluding depreciation, the increase in U.S. cost of revenues was primarily due to overall growth related to our revenue growth and costs associated with our expansion projects, including (i) an increase of $9.8 million in rent and facility costs, (ii) an increase of $7.9 million in utility costs as a result of increased customer installations and (iii) $5.7 million in higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (308 U.S. employees as of December 31, 2009 versus 289 as of December 31, 2008). We expect U.S. cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business. Europe Cost of Revenues. Europe cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 included $37.1 million and $33.5 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense of $4.1 million was primarily due to our IBX center expansion activity; however, this growth was partially offset by a $523,000 decrease in depreciation expense as we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded a $4.2 million decrease in depreciation expense as an out-of-period adjustment related to incorrectly depreciating certain assets. This $4.2 million out-of-period adjustment represents the correction of errors attributable to the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, which we have concluded were not material to any previously-reported historical quarterly periods or results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and to any previously-reported historical annual or quarterly periods for the years ended December 31, 2008 or 2007. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in Europe cost of revenues was primarily the result of costs associated with our expansion projects and overall growth in costs to support our revenue growth, such as (i) an increase of $11.0 million of utility costs arising from increased customer installations and revenues attributed to customer growth and (ii) $3.4 million of higher rent and facility costs. We expect Europe cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 included $24.4 million and $17.6 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense of $11.2 million was primarily due to our IBX data center expansion activity; however, this growth was partially offset by a $4.4 million decrease in depreciation expense as we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2009. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily the result of costs associated with our expansion projects and overall growth in costs to support our revenue growth, including (i) $3.9 million of higher utility costs as a result of increased customer installations and (ii) $2.2 million of higher rent and facility costs. We expect Asia-Pacific cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business. Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, Change 2009 % 2008 % $ % U.S. $ 35,900 56 % $ 38,219 57 % $ (2,319 ) (6 )% Europe 17,755 28 % 19,331 29 % (1,576 ) (8 )% Asia-Pacific 9,929 16 % 9,363 14 % 566 6 % Total $ 63,584 100 % $ 66,913 100 % $ (3,329 ) (5 )% 40 Table of Contents Years endedDecember 31, 2009 2008 Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues: U.S. 7 % 9 % Europe 8 % 11 % Asia-Pacific 8 % 11 % Total 7 % 9 % U.S. Sales and Marketing Expenses. The decrease in our U.S. sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $1.6 million of higher expenditures related to our branding initiatives in 2008. While we experienced an overall reduction in sales and marketing costs year over year, we generally expect U.S. sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to grow our business and invest further in various branding initiatives; however, as a percentage of revenues, we expect them to decrease. Europe Sales and Marketing Expenses. The decrease in our Europe sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $1.5 million of lower bad debt expense. While we experienced an overall reduction in sales and marketing costs year over year, we generally expect Europe sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to grow our business; however, as a percentage of revenues, we expect them to decrease. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense. We expect Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to grow our business; however, as a percentage of revenues, we expect them to decrease. General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, Change 2009 % 2008 % $ % U.S. $ 104,141 67 % $ 96,657 66 % $ 7,484 8 % Europe 33,240 21 % 34,071 23 % (831 ) (2 )% Asia-Pacific 17,943 12 % 15,836 11 % 2,107 13 % Total $ 155,324 100 % $ 146,564 100 % $ 8,760 6 % Years endedDecember 31, 2009 2008 General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues: U.S. 19 % 22 % Europe 15 % 19 % Asia-Pacific 15 % 19 % Total 18 % 21 % U.S. General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our U.S. general and administrative expenses was primarily due to $8.5 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (298 U.S. general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2009 versus 259 as of December 31, 2008). Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending given the current economic environment, we expect U.S. general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth; however, as a percentage of revenues, we expect them to decrease. Europe General and Administrative Expenses. The decrease in our Europe general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a $3.1 million one-time stock-based compensation charge due to equity award modifications related to the resignation of two senior officers in Europe during the year ended December 31, 41 Table of Contents 2008, partially offset by higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (109 Europe general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2009 versus 80 as of December 31, 2008). Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending given the current economic environment, we expect our Europe general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth; however, as a percentage of revenues, we expect them to decrease. Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was primarily due to $1.2 million of higher professional fees including legal fees. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending given the current economic environment, we expect Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth; however, as a percentage of revenues, we expect them to decrease. Acquisition Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $5.2 million, primarily related to the Upminster acquisition and the agreement to acquire Switch and Data. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we did not expense direct acquisition costs pursuant to the accounting standard applicable to that period. We expect our acquisition costs to increase significantly in 2010 as we incur additional expenses to complete the Switch and Data acquisition. Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded reductions of restructuring charges totaling $6.1 million, primarily due to a reversal of a restructuring charge accrual of $5.8 million for our excess space in the Los Angeles metro area as a result of our decision to utilize this space to expand our original Los Angeles IBX data center. Our excess space lease in the New York metro area remains abandoned and continues to carry a restructuring charge. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a restructuring charge adjustment of $3.1 million from revised sublease assumptions on the two excess space leases in the Los Angeles and New York metro areas as a result of new information becoming available. We are contractually committed to the lease of excess space in the New York metro area through 2015. Interest Income. Interest income decreased to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Interest income decreased primarily due to lower yields on invested balances. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 0.58% versus 2.77% for the year ended December 31, 2008. We expect our interest income to remain at these low levels for the foreseeable future due to a low interest rate environment and as we continue to utilize our cash to finance our expansion activities. Interest Expense. Interest expense was $74.2 million and $61.7 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher loan balances as a result of loan drawdowns and new financings entered into during 2008 and 2009 consisting of (i) our $373.8 million 4.75% convertible subordinated notes offering in June 2009, (ii) our Netherlands financing, of which $9.3 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2009 with an approximate interest rate of 4.31% per annum as compared to $6.5 million outstanding as of December 31, 2008 with an approximate interest rate of 4.18% per annum and (iii) our Singapore financing, which we obtained in September 2009, of which $24.6 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2009 with an approximate interest rate of 4.20% per annum. The increase was partially offset by higher capitalized interest expense, repayment of some loans and the partial conversions of certain of our convertible subordinated debentures in November 2008 and June 2009. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we capitalized $12.9 million and $7.9 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. Going forward, we expect to incur higher interest expense as we fully utilize or recognize the full impact of our existing financings, including the $373.8 million 4.75% convertible subordinated notes offering and the Singapore financing, although this will be partially offset by capitalized interest, which we expect to increase in 2010 as we intend to embark on more expansion projects than in prior years. We may also incur additional indebtedness to support our growth, resulting in further interest expense. Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Loss On Investments. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we recorded $2.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively, of other-than-temporary impairment losses on one 42 Table of Contents of our money market accounts as more fully described in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Additionally, in January 2010, we received an additional distribution of $3.4 million from this same money market account, which will be recorded as a recovery of other-than-temporary impairment losses in the first quarter of 2010. Other Income (Expense). For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we recorded $2.4 million and $1.3 million of other income, respectively, primarily attributable to foreign currency exchange gains during the periods. Income Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded $39.6 million of income tax expense. The tax expense recorded in the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily a result of applying the effective statutory tax rates to the operating income adjusted for permanent tax adjustments for the period, partially offset by income tax benefits due to the release of valuation allowances of $3.1 million and $5.2 million associated with our Hong Kong and U.K. operations, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $87.6 million of income tax benefits primarily due to recognition of deferred tax assets of $85.1 million and $6.1 million associated with our U.S. and Australian operations, respectively, partially offset by tax provisions from other jurisdictions. Going forward, we expect the effective blended tax rates to be consistent with 2009. As of December 31, 2009, we had total net deferred tax assets of $25.2 million consisting primarily of favorable temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards, the majority of which are attributable to our U.S. operations. Approximately $71.0 million of future pre-tax earnings for financial reporting purposes would need to be generated to realize these favorable temporary differences associated with our U.S. operations, which we believe is achievable based on our current level of pre-tax earnings and our profitability forecast for future years. Historically, the difference between the pretax earnings for financial reporting purposes and the taxable income for income tax purposes in our U.S. operations has primarily included temporary adjustments such as depreciation expense, stock-based compensation and capital lease expenses. The temporary differences either increase or decrease the pre-tax earnings for financial reporting purposes to arrive at the taxable income for income tax purposes. However, it is expected that these temporary differences will generally increase the taxable income in the foreseeable future. The majority of the net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes in our U.S. operations do not start to expire until 2023. For further information on our income taxes, refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 43 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, Change 2008 % 2007 % $ % U.S: Recurring revenues $ 423,940 60 % $ 311,188 74 % $ 112,752 36 % Non-recurring revenues 18,863 3 % 13,690 3 % 5,173 38 % 442,803 63 % 324,878 77 % 117,925 36 % Europe: Recurring revenues 165,669 24 % 35,309 9 % 130,360 369 % Non-recurring revenues 11,833 1 % 2,181 0 % 9,652 443 % 177,502 25 % 37,490 9 % 140,012 373 % Asia-Pacific: Recurring revenues 77,554 11 % 52,668 13 % 24,886 47 % Non-recurring revenues 6,821 1 % 4,406 1 % 2,415 55 % 84,375 12 % 57,074 14 % 27,301 48 % Total: Recurring revenues 667,163 95 % 399,165 95 % 267,998 67 % Non-recurring revenues 37,517 5 % 20,277 5 % 17,240 85 % $ 704,680 100 % $ 419,442 100 % $ 285,238 68 % U.S. Revenues. The period over period growth in recurring revenues was primarily the result of an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers, as well as selective price increases in each of our IBX markets. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $30.6 million of revenue generated from our newly-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Chicago, New York, Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. metro areas. Europe Revenues. Our revenues from the United Kingdom, the largest revenue contributor in the Europe region, represented approximately 38% and 37%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Our Europe revenues increased over the course of 2008 as this region had grown due to our expansion efforts. Asia-Pacific Revenues. Our revenues from Singapore, the largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, represented approximately 36% and 35%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. As in the U.S., Asia-Pacific revenue growth was due to an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers, as well as selective price increases in each of our IBX markets. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $12.5 million of revenue generated from our IBX data center expansions in the Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo metro areas. 44 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, Change 2008 % 2007 % $ % U.S. $ 238,583 57 % $ 198,455 75 % $ 40,128 20 % Europe 122,658 30 % 30,245 12 % 92,413 306 % Asia-Pacific 53,558 13 % 35,068 13 % 18,490 53 % Total $ 414,799 100 % $ 263,768 100 % $ 151,031 57 % Years endedDecember 31, 2008 2007 Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues: U.S. 54 % 61 % Europe 69 % 81 % Asia-Pacific 63 % 61 % Total 59 % 63 % U.S. Cost of Revenues. U.S. cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 included $91.9 million and $73.6 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was due to our IBX data center expansion activity. Excluding depreciation, the increase in U.S. cost of revenues was primarily due to overall growth related to our revenue growth and costs associated with our expansion projects, including (i) an increase of $15.7 million in utility costs as a result of increased customer installations, (ii) $6.0 million in higher compensation costs and (iii) an increase of $2.3 million in repair and maintenance costs, partially offset by a decrease of $3.0 million in rent and facility costs as a result of certain property acquisitions in 2007 and 2008. Europe Cost of Revenues. Europe cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 included $33.5 million and $7.6 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Our Europe cost of revenues increased over the course of 2008 as this region grew due to our expansion efforts. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 included $17.6 million and $9.3 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was due to our IBX data center expansion activity. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily the result of costs associated with our expansion projects and overall growth in connection with revenue growth, such as $4.2 million of higher utility costs arising from increased customer installations and revenues attributed to customer growth, as well as $2.5 million of additional rent expense associated with new leases in connection with our expansion activity. Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, Change 2008 % 2007 % $ % U.S. $ 38,219 57 % $ 31,291 77 % $ 6,928 22 % Europe 19,331 29 % 2,987 7 % 16,344 547 % Asia-Pacific 9,363 14 % 6,441 16 % 2,922 45 % Total $ 66,913 100 % $ 40,719 100 % $ 26,194 64 % 45 Table of Contents Years endedDecember 31, 2008 2007 Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues: U.S. 9 % 10 % Europe 11 % 8 % Asia-Pacific 11 % 11 % Total 9 % 10 % U.S. Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in U.S. sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to an increase of $3.3 million in sales compensation costs as a result of revenue growth and $2.6 million of higher expenditures related to our branding initiatives. Europe Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our Europe sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 included $6.0 million and $1.8 million of amortization expense related to customer contract intangible assets. Excluding amortization expense, our Europe sales and marketing expenses have grown over the course of 2008 as we grew this business and invested in various branding and integration initiatives. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we also recorded $1.3 million of bad debt expense. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to an increase in sales compensation over the prior period associated with the overall growth in this region and with expenditures related to our branding initiatives. General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, Change 2008 % 2007 % $ % U.S. $ 96,657 66 % $ 83,215 79 % $ 13,442 16 % Europe 34,071 23 % 8,292 7 % 25,779 311 % Asia-Pacific 15,836 11 % 14,287 14 % 1,549 11 % Total $ 146,564 100 % $ 105,794 100 % $ 40,770 39 % Years endedDecember 31, 2008 2007 General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues: U.S. 22 % 26 % Europe 19 % 22 % Asia-Pacific 19 % 25 % Total 21 % 25 % U.S. General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in U.S. general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $7.9 million of higher compensation costs, including increases in general salary, bonuses and stock-based compensation, and headcount growth (259 U.S. general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2008 versus 240 as of December 31, 2007), (ii) an increase of $2.6 million in professional fees related to various consulting projects to support our growth and (iii) an increase of $919,000 in depreciation expense as a result of our continued investment in information technology systems to support our growth. Europe General and Administrative Expenses. Our Europe general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 included $7.8 million and $862,000, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, our Europe general and administrative expenses had increased over the course of 2008 in connection with our growth and integration initiatives. 46 Table of Contents Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher compensation costs, including general salary increases and bonuses. Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a restructuring charge adjustment of $3.1 million from revised sublease assumptions on our two excess space leases in the Los Angeles and New York metro areas as a result of new information becoming available. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a restructuring charge adjustment of $407,000 from revised sublease assumptions for the excess space lease in the Los Angeles metro area as a result of new information becoming available. The original restructuring charge for these two leases was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 and totaled $17.7 million. We are contractually committed to these two space leases through 2015 (although we reversed our position on one of these leases in 2009, as discussed above). Gains on Asset Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a $1.3 million gain in connection with the sale of our Equinix mail service offering, which we sold for $1.7 million in gross cash proceeds. No gains on asset sales were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2008. Interest Income. Interest income decreased to $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Interest income decreased primarily due to lower yields on invested balances and lower average cash balances. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 2.77% versus 5.08% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $61.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to new financings entered into during 2007 and 2008 consisting of (i) our $110.0 million Chicago IBX financing, which was drawn down during the construction period of the Chicago metro area IBX expansion project and which became fully drawn in March 2008, with an approximate interest rate of 4.19% per annum; (ii) our $250.0 million 2.50% convertible subordinated notes offering in March 2007; (iii) our approximately $91.0 million Asia-Pacific financing, of which approximately $63.2 million was drawn during 2008 and, which was fully drawn as of December 31, 2008, with an approximate blended interest rate of 3.69% per annum; (iv) our $396.0 million 3.00% convertible subordinated notes offering in September 2007; (v) our approximately $131.0 million European financing, of which approximately $72.7 million was drawn during 2008 leaving only approximately $2.9 million remaining available to draw, with an approximate blended interest rate of 4.39% per annum and (vi) our Netherlands financing of approximately $6.5 million, acquired as a result of the Virtu acquisition, with an approximate interest rate of 4.18% per annum. This increase was partially offset by the partial conversion of $13.1 million of our 2.50% convertible subordinated debentures in November 2008 that resulted in a decrease in interest expense. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we capitalized $7.9 million and $10.4 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Loss On Investments. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $1.5 million of other-than-temporary impairment losses on one of our money market accounts as more fully described in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we did not record any other-than-temporary impairment loss on investments. Other Income (Expense). For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $1.3 million of other income, primarily attributable to foreign currency exchange gains during the year. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded $3.0 million of other income, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains, including a foreign exchange gain of $1.5 million as a result of hedging a portion of the IXEurope acquisition purchase price with forward contracts. Loss on Conversion and Extinguishment of Debt. In March 2007, we retired $54.0 million of our convertible subordinated debentures in exchange for approximately 1.4 million newly issued shares of our common stock. As a result, we recorded a $3.4 million loss on debt conversion in accordance with the accounting 47 Table of Contents standard for induced conversions of convertible debt due to the inducement fee paid. In September 2007, a senior bridge loan was terminated unused and, as a result, we recorded a $2.5 million loss on debt extinguishment reflecting the immediate write-off of capitalized debt issuance costs to secure the senior bridge loan. As a result of these two events, during the year ended December 31, 2007 we recognized a total of $5.9 million of loss on debt conversion and extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we did not record any loss on conversion or extinguishment of debt. Income Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $87.6 million of income tax benefits primarily due to recognition of deferred tax assets of $85.1 million and $6.1 million associated with our U.S. and Australian operations, respectively, partially offset by tax provisions from other jurisdictions. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded $473,000 of income tax expense primarily attributable to our foreign operations. As of December 31, 2008, we had a total valuation allowance of $40.3 million against our deferred tax assets, which is attributable to certain of our foreign operations. As of December 31, 2008, we had total net deferred tax assets of $81.7 million consisting primarily of favorable temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards, the majority of which are attributable to our U.S. operations. Approximately $155.0 million of future pretax earnings for financial reporting purposes would need to be generated to realize these favorable temporary differences associated with our U.S. operations. In addition, approximately $54.0 million of future taxable income would need to be generated in future years to realize these net operating loss carryforwards associated with our U.S. operations. For further information on our income taxes, refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We provide all information required in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but we believe that evaluating our ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, we use non-GAAP financial measures, primarily adjusted EBITDA, to evaluate our operations. In presenting this non-GAAP financial measure, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future operating performance. These items are depreciation, amortization, accretion of asset retirement obligations and accrued restructuring charges, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, acquisition costs and gains on asset sales. Legislative and regulatory requirements encourage use of and emphasis on GAAP financial metrics and require companies to explain why non-GAAP financial metrics are relevant to management and investors. We exclude these items in order for our lenders, investors, and industry analysts, who review and report on us, to better evaluate our operating performance and cash spending levels relative to our industry sector and competitors. We exclude depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of our IBX data centers and do not reflect our current or future cash spending levels to support our business. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets, and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of our IBX data centers do not recur and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to our initial investment. This is a trend we expect to continue. In addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of our IBX data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historic costs incurred to build out our IBX data centers, and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. Therefore, we exclude depreciation from our operating results when evaluating our operations. In addition, in presenting the non-GAAP financial measures, we exclude amortization expense related to certain intangible assets, as it represents a cost that may not recur and is not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance. We exclude accretion expense, both as it relates to asset retirement obligations as well as accrued restructuring charge liabilities, as these expenses represent costs, which we believe are not meaningful in evaluating our current operations. We exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense as it represents expense attributed to equity awards that have no current or future cash obligations. As such, we, and many investors and analysts, exclude this stock-based compensation expense when assessing the cash generating 48 Table of Contents performance of our operations. We also exclude restructuring charges from our non-GAAP financial measures. The restructuring charges relate to our decisions to exit leases for excess space adjacent to several of our IBX data centers, which we did not intend to build out, or our decision to reverse such restructuring charges. We also exclude acquisition costs from our non-GAAP financial measures. The acquisition costs relate to costs we incur in connection with business combinations. With respect to 2007 results, we exclude the gain from the sale of our Equinix mail service offering located in Singapore, which is referred to as the EMS sale. The gain on the EMS sale represents a unique transaction for us and future sales of other service offerings are not expected. Management believes such items as restructuring charges, acquisition costs and gains on asset sales are non-core transactions, however; these types of costs will or may occur in future periods. Our management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. However, we have presented such non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. We believe that the inclusion of this non-GAAP financial measure provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and its ability to perform in subsequent periods. We believe that if we did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze Equinix effectively. Investors should note, however, that the non-GAAP financial measures used by Equinix may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as that of other companies. In addition, whenever we use non-GAAP financial measures, we provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, acquisition costs and gains on asset sales as presented below (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Income from operations $ 181,079 $ 73,262 $ 10,092 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 175,371 160,987 103,498 Stock-based compensation expense 53,056 55,085 42,731 Restructuring charges (6,053 ) 3,142 407 Acquisitions costs 5,155 — — Gains on asset sales — — (1,338 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 408,608 $ 292,476 $ 155,390 49 Table of Contents The geographic split of our adjusted EBITDA is presented below (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 U.S.: Income from operations $ 128,168 $ 66,202 $ 11,510 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 106,207 101,414 83,893 Stock-based compensation expense 40,082 40,993 36,552 Restructuring charges (6,053 ) 3,142 407 Acquisitions costs 4,091 — — Adjusted EBITDA $ 272,495 $ 211,751 $ 132,362 Europe: Income (loss) from operations $ 31,202 $ 1,442 $ (4,034 ) Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 43,744 41,208 9,837 Stock-based compensation expense 5,843 8,473 899 Acquisitions costs 1,064 — — Adjusted EBITDA $ 81,853 $ 51,123 $ 6,702 Asia-Pacific: Income from operations $ 21,709 $ 5,618 $ 2,616 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 25,420 18,365 9,768 Stock-based compensation expense 7,131 5,619 5,280 Gains on asset sales — — (1,338 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 54,260 $ 29,602 $ 16,326 Our adjusted EBITDA results have improved each year and in each region due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in “Results of Operations”, as well as the nature of our business model consisting of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature that is also discussed earlier in “Overview”. We believe that our adjusted EBITDA results will continue to improve in future periods as we continue to grow our business. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2009, our total indebtedness was comprised of (i) convertible debt principal totaling $1.0 billion from our 2.50% convertible subordinated notes (gross of discount), our 3.00% convertible subordinated notes and our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes (gross of discount) and (ii) non-convertible debt and financing obligations totaling $591.3 million of principal from our Washington D.C. metro area IBX capital lease, San Jose IBX equipment and fiber financing, Chicago IBX equipment financing, Los Angeles IBX financing, Paris IBX capital lease, Zurich IBX financing, London IBX financing, Ashburn campus mortgage payable, Chicago IBX financing, Asia-Pacific financing, European financing, Netherlands financing, Singapore financing and other financing obligations. We believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of our current portion of debt due, and to complete our publicly-announced expansion projects, as well as the Switch and Data acquisition, of which 20% of the total purchase price is payable in cash, for at least the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2009, we had $604.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments; however, of this amount, a total of $67.2 million resides in certain European subsidiaries where the use of such cash is currently limited to the general working capital needs of these certain European subsidiaries or repaying the European financing. Besides our investment portfolio and any financing activities we may pursue, customer collections are our primary source of cash. While we believe we have a strong customer base and have continued to experience relatively strong 50 Table of Contents collections, if the current market conditions were to deteriorate further, some of our customers may have difficulty paying us and we may experience increased churn in our customer base, including reductions in their commitments to us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. As of December 31, 2009, we had a total of approximately $13.3 million of additional liquidity available to us, which consists of (i) $8.3 million under the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line, which we amended in February 2010 to extend the maturity date to February 2011 (see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K); (ii) $3.2 million under the European financing for general working capital purposes and (iii) $1.8 million under the Singapore financing. Our indebtedness as of December 31, 2009, as noted above, included $591.3 million of non-convertible senior debt. Although these are committed facilities, most of which are fully drawn or utilized and for which we are amortizing debt repayments of either principal and/or interest only, and we are in full compliance with all covenants related to them effective December 31, 2009, deteriorating market and liquidity conditions may give rise to issues which may impact the lenders’ ability to hold these debt commitments to their full term. While we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our current operating requirements and to complete our publicly-announced IBX expansion plans and the Switch and Data acquisition, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build-out of new IBX data centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as potential acquisitions. While we will be able to fund some of these expansion plans with our existing resources, additional financing, either debt or equity, may be required to pursue certain of these additional expansion plans. However, if current market conditions were to deteriorate further, we may be unable to secure additional financing or any such additional financing may be available to us on unfavorable terms. An inability to pursue additional expansion opportunities will have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our desired level of revenue growth in future periods. Sources and Uses of Cash Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 355,492 $ 267,558 $ 120,020 Net cash used in investing activities (558,178 ) (478,040 ) (1,054,725 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 323,598 145,106 1,145,013 Operating Activities The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to improved operating results as discussed above, strong collections of accounts receivable, management of vendor payments and growth in customer installations, which increases deferred installation revenue. We expect that we will continue to generate cash from our operating activities throughout 2010 and beyond. Investing Activities The significant increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2007 compared to 2009 and 2008 included (i) $541.8 million spent to acquire IXEurope, net of cash acquired, and (ii) $120.5 million spent to acquire real estate properties in San Jose and Los Angeles, California. Excluding these unique and significant events, the changes in our investing activities over the past three years is primarily related to our capital expenditures in property, plant and equipment for our IBX data center expansion activity. During the three years ended December 31, 2009, these capital expenditures were $369.5 million, $447.0 million and $376.8 million, respectively. We expect that our IBX expansion construction activity will be at consistent levels when compared to the past three years. However, if the opportunity to expand is greater than planned and we have sufficient funding to increase the expansion opportunities available to us, we may increase the level of capital expenditures to support this growth. 51 Table of Contents Financing Activities The significant increase in net cash provided by financing activities during 2007 compared to 2009 and 2008 included approximately $967.0 million of net proceeds raised in a common stock offering and two convertible debt offerings, the majority of which was used to fund the IXEurope acquisition and our IBX data center expansion activities. Excluding this significant amount of fundraising in 2007, the changes in our financing activities primarily relate to the net proceeds from a convertible debt offering of $373.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and the proceeds from our mortgage and notes payable and credit line totaling $29.5 million, $142.4 million and $149.6 million, respectively, for the three years ended December 31, 2009. We expect that our financing activities will consist primarily of repayment of our debt during 2010 although this will be offset by the proceeds of any financings we may undertake during 2010. Debt Obligations—Convertible Debt 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes. In June 2009, we issued $373.8 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% convertible subordinated notes due June 15, 2016. Interest is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2009. The initial conversion rate is 11.8599 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. This represents an initial conversion price of approximately $84.32 per share of common stock. Upon conversion, holders will receive, at our election, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2009, the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes were convertible into 4.4 million shares of our common stock. Holders of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes may convert their notes under certain defined circumstances, including during any fiscal quarter (and only during that fiscal quarter) ending after December 31, 2009, if the sale price of our common stock, for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter, is greater than 130% of the conversion price per share of common stock on such last trading day, which was $109.62 per share, or at any time on or after March 15, 2016. Upon conversion, if we elected to pay a sufficiently large portion of the conversion obligation in cash, additional consideration beyond the $373.8 million of gross proceeds received would be required. However, to minimize the impact of potential dilution upon conversion of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, we entered into capped call transactions, which are referred to as the capped call, separate from the issuance of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, for which we paid a premium of $49.7 million. The capped call covers a total of approximately 4.4 million shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment. Under the capped call, we effectively raised the conversion price of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes from $84.32 to $114.82. Depending upon our stock price at the time the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes are converted, the capped call will return up to 1.2 million shares of our common stock to us; however, we will receive no benefit from the capped call if our stock price is $84.32 or lower at the time of conversion and will receive less shares for share prices in excess of $114.82 at the time of conversion than we would have received at a share price of $114.82 (our benefit from the capped call is capped at $114.82 and no additional benefit is received beyond this price). We do not have the right to redeem the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes at our option. We separately accounted for the liability and equity components of our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes in accordance with a FASB standard for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement). See “4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes” in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 3.00% Convertible Subordinated Notes. In September 2007, we issued $396.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Convertible Subordinated Notes due October 15, 2014. Interest is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, and commenced in April 2008. 52 Table of Contents Holders of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes may convert their notes at their option on any day up to and including the business day immediately preceding the maturity date into shares of our common stock. The base conversion rate is 7.436 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. This represents a base conversion price of approximately $134.48 per share of common stock. If, at the time of conversion, the applicable stock price of our common stock exceeds the base conversion price, the conversion rate will be determined pursuant to a formula resulting in the receipt of up to 4.4616 additional shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. However, in no event would the total number of shares issuable upon conversion of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes exceed 11.8976 per $1,000 principal amount of 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, or the equivalent of $84.05 per share of our common stock or a total of 4.7 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2009, the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes were convertible into 2.9 million shares of our common stock. We do not have the right to redeem the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes at our option. 2.50% Convertible Subordinated Notes. In March 2007, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.50% convertible subordinated notes due 2012. The interest on the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes is payable semi-annually every April 15th and October 15th, and commenced in October 2007. The initial conversion rate is 8.9259 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. This represents an initial conversion price of approximately $112.03 per share of common stock or 2.2 million shares of our common stock. Upon conversion, holders will receive, at our election, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. Holders of the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes may convert their notes under certain defined circumstances, including during any fiscal quarter (and only during that fiscal quarter) ending after June 30, 2007, if the sale price of our common stock, for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter, is greater than 130% of the conversion price per share of common stock on such last trading day, which was $145.64 per share, or at any time on or after March 15, 2012. We may only redeem all or a portion of the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes at any time after April 16, 2010 for cash but only if the closing sale price of our common stock for at least 20 of the 30 consecutive trading days immediately prior to the day we give notice of redemption is greater than 130% of the applicable conversion price per share of common stock on the date of the notice, which was $145.64 per share as of December 31, 2009. The redemption price will equal 100% of the principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Upon conversion, due to the conversion formulas associated with the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes, if our stock is trading at levels exceeding 130% of the conversion price per share of common stock, and if we elect to pay any portion of the consideration in cash, additional consideration beyond the $250.0 million of gross proceeds received would be required. However, in no event would the total number of shares issuable upon conversion of the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes exceed 11.6036 per $1,000 principal amount of convertible subordinated notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, or the equivalent of $86.18 per share of common stock or a total of 2.9 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2009, the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes were convertible into 2.2 million shares of our common stock. We separately accounted for the liability and equity components of our 2.50% convertible subordinated notes in accordance with a FASB standard for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement). See “2.50% Convertible Subordinated Notes” in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 53 Table of Contents Debt Obligations—Non-Convertible Debt Capital Lease and Other Financing Obligations Washington D.C. Metro Area IBX Capital Lease. In April 2004, we entered into a long-term lease for a 95,000 square foot data center in the Washington, D.C. metro area. The center is adjacent to our existing Washington D.C. metro area IBX data center. This lease, which includes the leasing of all of the IBX plant and machinery equipment located in the building, is a capital lease. We took possession of this property during the fourth quarter of 2004, and as a result, recorded property, plant and equipment assets, as well as a capital lease obligation, totaling $35.3 million. Payments under this lease will be made monthly through October 2019 at an effective interest rate of 8.50% per annum. As of December 31, 2009, principal of $30.1 million remained outstanding under this capital lease. San Jose IBX Equipment and Fiber Financing. In December 2004, we entered into a long-term lease for a 103,000 square foot data center in San Jose, and at the same time entered into separate agreements to purchase the equipment located within this new IBX data center and to interconnect all three of our Silicon Valley area IBX data centers to each other through redundant dark fiber links. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, these three separate agreements were considered to be a single arrangement. Furthermore, while the building component of this transaction is classified as a long-term operating lease, the equipment and fiber portions of the transaction were classified as financed assets. We took possession of this property during the first quarter of 2005, and as a result, recorded property, plant and equipment and prepaid fiber assets, as well as a financing obligation, totaling $18.7 million. Payments under this financing obligation will be made monthly through May 2020 at an effective interest rate of 8.50% per annum. As of December 31, 2009, principal of $13.7 million remained outstanding under this financing obligation. Chicago IBX Equipment Financing. In July 2005, we entered into a long-term sublease for a 107,000 square foot data center in Chicago, and at the same time entered into a separate agreement to purchase the equipment located within this IBX data center. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, these two separate agreements were considered to be a single arrangement. Furthermore, while the building component of this transaction is classified as a long-term operating lease, the equipment portion of the transaction is classified as financed assets. We took possession of this property and title to the equipment assets in November 2005, and as a result, recorded IBX equipment assets, as well as a financing obligation, totaling $9.7 million at that time. Payments under this financing obligation will be made monthly through August 2015 at an effective interest rate of 7.50% per annum. As of December 31, 2009, principal of $6.2 million remained outstanding under this financing obligation. Los Angeles IBX Financing. In September 2005, we purchased a 107,000 square foot data center in the Los Angeles metro area for $34.7 million, which we paid for in full with cash. In October 2005, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell this Los Angeles IBX for $38.7 million and to lease it back from the purchaser pursuant to a long-term lease, which closed in December 2005, and we received net proceeds from the sale of this property of $38.1 million. However, due to our continuing involvement concerning certain aspects of this property, the sale and leaseback of this property does not qualify as a sale-leaseback under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, but rather is accounted for as a financing of the property. We refer to this portion of the transaction as the Los Angeles IBX financing. Pursuant to the Los Angeles IBX financing, we recorded a financing obligation liability totaling $38.1 million in December 2005. Payments under the Los Angeles IBX financing will be made monthly through December 2025 at an effective interest rate of 7.75% per annum. As of December 31, 2009, principal of $37.4 million remained outstanding under this financing obligation. Paris IBX Capital Lease. In September 2008, we entered into a long-term lease for 10,850 square meters of vacant space within a warehouse building in the Paris, France metro area. The center is adjacent to one of our existing Paris metro area IBX data centers. This lease is a capital lease and commenced on October 1, 2008. We took possession of this property during the fourth quarter of 2008, and as a result, recorded property, plant and equipment assets, as well as a capital lease obligation, totaling 28.1 million Euros. Monthly payments under this 54 Table of Contents lease commencing in April 2009 will be made through September 2020 at an effective interest rate of 7.43% per annum. As of December 31, 2009, principal of $40.6 million remained outstanding under this capital lease. London IBX Financing. In October 2008, we entered into an agreement for lease for property and a warehouse building to be constructed for us in the London, England metro area. This agreement provides for the completion of a warehouse building within a specified time and the entry into a definitive lease upon its completion, which is referred to as the lease. As of December 31, 2009, principal of $14.0 million was outstanding under this financing obligation. See “London IBX Expansion Project” in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Zurich IBX Financing. In July 2009, we entered into a long-term lease for building space within a multi-floor, multi-tenant building in the Zurich, Switzerland metro area. This lease has a fixed term of 10 years, with options to extend for up to an additional 10 years, in five-year increments. Cumulative minimum payments under the Zurich Lease total 9.0 million Swiss Francs over the Zurich Lease term, which does not include any rent obligation for the extension periods. Pursuant to the accounting standards for lessee’s involvement in asset construction and for leasing transactions involving special-purpose entities, we are considered the owner of the leased building space during the construction phase due to some specific provisions contained in this lease. Monthly payments under the Zurich IBX Financing commenced in July 2009 and will be made through June 2019 at an effective interest rate of 5.20% per annum. As of December 31, 2009, principal of $11.5 million remained outstanding under this capital lease. Other Capital Lease and Financing Obligations. We have various other capital leases and financing obligations under which principal of $7.6 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2009. Mortgage and Loans Payable Ashburn Campus Mortgage Payable. In December 2005, we completed the financing of our October 2005 purchase of the Ashburn campus property with a $60.0 million mortgage to be amortized over 20 years. Upon receipt of the $60.0 million of cash in December 2005, we recorded a $60.0 million mortgage payable. Payments under the Ashburn campus mortgage payable will be made monthly through January 2026 at an effective interest rate of 8.1% per annum. In December 2006, we obtained an additional financing of $40.0 million under the Ashburn campus mortgage payable, which increased the total amount financed under the Ashburn campus mortgage payable to $100.0 million, on the same terms as the initial mortgage payable. As of December 31, 2009, principal of $91.8 million remained outstanding under this mortgage payable. Chicago IBX Financing. In February 2007, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries obtained a loan of up to $110.0 million to finance up to 60% of the development and construction costs of the Chicago metro area IBX expansion project, which we refer to as the Chicago IBX financing. Funds were advanced at up to 60% of project costs incurred. As of December 31, 2008, we had received advances representing a final loan payable totaling $110.0 million. The loan payable has an initial maturity date of January 31, 2010, with options to extend for up to an additional two years, in one-year increments, upon satisfaction of certain extension conditions. In January 2010, we utilized one of the options to extend the loan payable under the Chicago IBX financing for one year, which is set to expire on January 31, 2011. As a result of this extension, the loan payable is repaid in monthly installments beginning in February 2010. The loan payable bears interest at a floating rate (one, three or six month LIBOR plus 2.75%) with interest payable monthly, which commenced in March 2007. As of December 31, 2009, the loan payable had an approximate interest rate of 3.00% per annum. The Chicago IBX financing has no specific financial covenants, contains a limited parent company guaranty and is collateralized by the assets of one of our Chicago IBX data centers. In May 2008, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with one counterparty to hedge the interest payments on principal of $105.0 million of the Chicago IBX financing, which will mature in February 2011. Under the terms of the interest rate swap transaction, we receive interest payments based on rolling one-month LIBOR terms and pay interest at the fixed interest rate of 6.34% (swap rate of 3.59% plus borrowing margin of 2.75%). 55 Table of Contents Asia-Pacific Financing. In August 2007, two of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, located in Singapore and Tokyo, Japan, entered into an approximately $47.9 million multi-currency credit facility agreement (using the exchange rates as of December 31, 2009), which is comprised of 23.0 million Singapore dollars and 2.9 billion Japanese yen, respectively, which we refer to as the Asia-Pacific financing. In 2008, the Asia-Pacific financing was amended to enable our subsidiaries in Australia and Hong Kong to borrow up to 32.0 million Australian dollars and 156.0 million Hong Kong dollars, respectively, under the same general terms, amending the Asia-Pacific financing into an approximately $96.7 million multi-currency credit facility agreement. The Asia-Pacific financing has a four-year term that allows these four subsidiaries to borrow up to their credit limits during the first 12-month period with repayment to occur over the remaining three years in 12 equal quarterly installments. The Asia-Pacific financing bears interest at a floating rate (the relevant three-month local cost of funds), as applicable, plus 1.85%-2.50% depending on the ratio of our senior indebtedness to our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, with interest payable quarterly. Loans payable under the Asia-Pacific financing have a final maturity date of March 2012. The Asia-Pacific financing was used by these four subsidiaries to fund capital expenditures on leasehold improvements, equipment, and other installation costs related to expansion plans in Singapore, Tokyo, Sydney and Hong Kong. The Asia-Pacific financing is guaranteed by the parent company and is secured by the assets of these four subsidiaries, including a pledge of their shares, and has several financial covenants specific to our Asia-Pacific operations with which we must comply quarterly. As of December 31, 2009, a total of $64.6 million was outstanding under the Asia-Pacific financing at an approximate blended interest rate of 3.45%. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in connection with the Asia-Pacific financing. European Financing. In September 2007, as a result of the IXEurope acquisition, our wholly-owned subsidiary assumed a senior facilities agreement totaling approximately 82.0 million British pounds, or approximately $132.6 million (using the exchange rate as of December 31, 2009), which we refer to as the European financing. The European financing is comprised of three facilities: (i) Facility A, which was available to draw upon through March 2008, provides for a term loan of up to approximately 40.0 million British pounds and bears a floating interest rate per annum of between 0.875% and 2.25% above LIBOR or EURIBOR; (ii) Facility B, which was available to draw upon through June 2010, provides for a term loan of up to approximately 40.0 million British pounds and bears a floating interest rate per annum of between 0.875% and 2.25% above LIBOR or EURIBOR and (iii) Facility C, which is available to draw upon through May 2014, provides for a revolving credit facility of up to approximately 2.0 million British pounds and bears a floating interest rate per annum of between 0.875% and 2.125% above LIBOR or EURIBOR. As of December 31, 2009, we had fully utilized Facility A and Facility B under the European financing. The European financing has a final maturity date of June 30, 2014 and interest is payable in periods of one, two, three or six months at our election. Facility A will be repaid in 13 semi-annual installments, which commenced June 30, 2008. Facility B will be repaid in nine semi-annual installments commencing June 30, 2010. Facility C will be repaid at the final maturity date. The European financing is available to fund our current or future operations in Europe, including capital expenditures, for certain subsidiaries in Europe, and amounts can be drawn in British pounds, Euros or Swiss francs. The European financing is collateralized by certain of our assets in Europe and contains several financial covenants specific to our European operations with which we must comply quarterly. In January 2009, we amended certain provisions of the European financing related to certain financial covenants and acknowledgment of the appointment of an executive officer in Europe. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in connection with the European financing. Upon a written request from us at any time after December 31, 2007 and through the final maturity date, and upon approval by the lenders, an additional term loan of up to 15.0 million British pounds, or approximately $21.9 million, may be made available to us. The European financing requires us to hedge the floating interest rates inherent in the European financing (on just a portion of the total amounts outstanding). As of December 31, 2009, approximately $130.1 million was outstanding under the European financing at an approximate blended interest rate of 1.62% per annum. 56 Table of Contents In May 2008, we entered into three interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest payments on the equivalent principal of $89.1 million of the European financing, which will mature in May 2011. Under the terms of the interest rate swap transactions, we receive interest payments based on rolling one-month EURIBOR and LIBOR terms and pay fixed interest rates ranging from 5.59% to 7.03% (swap rates ranging from 4.46% to 5.91% plus borrowing margin). Singapore Financing. In September 2009, our wholly-owned subsidiary in Singapore entered into a 37.0 million Singapore dollar, or approximately $26.3 million (using the exchange rate as of December 31, 2009) credit facility agreement, which is referred to as the Singapore financing. The Singapore financing is comprised of two tranches: (i) Facility A, which is available for drawing upon through March 18, 2010, provides a term loan of up to 34.5 million Singapore dollars and (ii) Facility B, which is available for drawing upon through September 12, 2010, provides a term loan of up to 2.5 million Singapore dollars. As of December 31, 2009, we had fully utilized Facility A under the Singapore financing. Facility A will be repaid in nine semi-annual installments beginning August 2010 and Facility B will be repaid in eight semi-annual installments beginning February 2011. The loans payable under the Singapore financing bear interest at a floating rate (swap offer rate plus 3.65% per annum). The Singapore financing has a final maturity date of August 31, 2014 and interest is payable in periods of one, three or six months at the election of our Singaporean subsidiary. The Singapore financing is guaranteed by the parent, Equinix, and is secured by the assets of our second IBX data center in Singapore. The Singapore financing has several financial covenants specific to our operations in Singapore, with which we must comply periodically commencing in the second quarter of 2010. As of December 31, 2009, we had borrowings under the Facility A tranche of 34.5 million Singapore dollars, or approximately $24.6 million, at an approximate interest rate per annum of 4.20%, leaving 2.5 million Singapore dollars, or approximately $1.8 million, available for future borrowings under the Singapore financing. Netherlands Financing. In February 2008, as a result of the Virtu acquisition, our wholly-owned subsidiary in the Netherlands assumed senior credit facilities totaling approximately 5.5 million Euros, which are callable by the lender and bear interest at a floating rate (three month EURIBOR plus 1.25%), which is referred to as the Netherlands financing. In June 2009, we amended the Netherlands financing by entering into a 7.0 million Euro term loan to replace the previously outstanding senior credit facilities. The Netherlands financing contains several financial covenants, which we must comply with annually, is guaranteed by us and is collateralized by substantially all of our operations in the Netherlands. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in connection with the Netherlands financing. The Netherlands financing has a final maturity date of June 30, 2016 with repayment to occur over the remaining seven years in 28 equal quarterly installments, which commenced in September 2009. The Netherlands financing bears interest at a floating rate (three month EURIBOR plus 3.60% per annum). As of December 31, 2009, a total of 6.5 million Euros, or approximately $9.3 million, was outstanding under the Netherlands financing with an approximate interest rate per annum of 4.31%. $25.0 Million Bank of America Revolving Credit Line. In February 2009, we entered into a $25.0 million one-year revolving credit facility with Bank of America, which is referred to as the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line. The $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line will be used primarily to fund our working capital and to enable us to issue letters of credit. The effect of issuing letters of credit under the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line reduces the amount available for borrowing under the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line. We may borrow, repay and reborrow under the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line at either the prime rate or at a borrowing margin of 2.75% over one, three or six month LIBOR, subject to a minimum borrowing cost of 3.00%. The $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line contains three financial covenants, which we must comply with quarterly, consisting of a tangible net worth ratio, a debt service ratio and a senior leverage ratio and is collateralized by our domestic accounts receivable balances. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in connection with the Bank of America revolving credit line. The $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line is available for renewal subject to mutual agreement by both parties. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we entered into 17 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $16.7 million under the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line, which resulted in our release of restricted cash to 57 Table of Contents unrestricted cash. As a result, the amount available to borrow was $8.3 million as of December 31, 2009. In February 2010, we amended the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line to extend the maturity date to February 2011 (see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements We lease a majority of our IBX data centers and certain equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements expiring through 2027.

(3) Represents principal and interest. (4) Represents minimum operating lease payments, excluding potential lease renewals. (5) Represents off-balance sheet arrangements. Other contractual commitments are described below. (6) Represents liability, net of future accretion expense. (7) The loan payable under the Chicago IBX financing had an initial maturity date of January 31, 2010, with options to extend for up to an additional two years, in one-year increments, upon satisfaction of certain extension conditions. In January 2010, we extended the maturity of the loan payable under the Chicago IBX financing for a year and we intend to extend the maturity of the loan payable under the Chicago IBX financing for another year in 2011. In connection with six of our IBX leases, we entered into 17 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $16.7 million with Bank of America. These letters of credit were provided in lieu of cash deposits under the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line and automatically renew in successive one-year periods until the final lease expiration date. If the landlords for these IBX leases decide to drawdown on these letters of credit triggered by an event of default under the lease, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowing under the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line. These contingent commitments are not reflected in the table above. 58 Table of Contents Primarily as a result of our various IBX expansion projects, as of December 31, 2009, we were contractually committed for $151.7 million of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for IBX equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided, in connection with the work necessary to complete construction and open these IBX data centers prior to making them available to customers for installation. This amount, which is expected to be paid during 2010 and 2011, is reflected in the table above as “other contractual commitments.” We have other non-capital purchase commitments in place as of December 31, 2009, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations, primarily in the U.S., Australia, Germany, Singapore, Tokyo and the United Kingdom, through 2010 and thereafter, and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods or services to be delivered or provided during 2010 and beyond. Such other purchase commitments as of December 31, 2009, which total $107.2 million, are also reflected in the table above as “other contractual commitments.” In addition, although we are not contractually obligated to do so, we expect to incur additional capital expenditures of approximately $100 million to $150 million, in addition to the $151.7 million in contractual commitments discussed above as of December 31, 2009, in our various IBX expansion projects during 2010 in order to complete the work needed to open these IBX data centers. These non-contractual capital expenditures are not reflected in the table above. If we so choose, whether due to economic factors or other considerations, we could delay these non-contractual capital expenditure commitments to preserve liquidity. Other Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements We have various guarantor arrangements with both our directors and officers and third parties, including customers, vendors and business partners (see “Guarantor Arrangements” in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). As of December 31, 2009, there were no significant liabilities recorded for these arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates, among others, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require significant judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain: • Accounting for income taxes; • Accounting for impairment of goodwill; and • Accounting for property, plant and equipment. 59 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid. The accounting standard for income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined by the accounting standard as a likelihood of more than 50 percent) such assets will not be realized. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future events. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. If, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account a number of types of evidence, including the following: 1) the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, 2) sources of future taxable income and 3) tax planning strategies. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had total net deferred tax assets of $25.2 million and $81.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had a total valuation allowance of $34.4 million and $40.3 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we decided to release our valuation allowance associated with Hong Kong operations and one of our U.K. operations, which resulted in an income tax benefit of $3.1 million and $5.2 million, respectively, in our results of operations. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we decided to release our valuation allowances associated with our U.S. and Australian operations, which resulted in an income tax benefit of $85.1 million and $6.1 million, respectively, in our results of operations for this period. Our decisions to release our valuation allowances associated with Australian, Hong Kong, U.K. and U.S. operations were based on our belief that the operations of these regions have achieved a sufficient level of profitability and will sustain a sufficient level of profitability in the future to support the release of these valuation allowances based on relevant facts and circumstances. However, if our assumptions on the future performance of these jurisdictions prove not to be correct and these jurisdictions are not able to sustain a sufficient level of profitability to support the associated deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet, we will have to impair our deferred tax assets through an additional valuation allowance, which would impact our financial position and results of operations in the period such a determination is made. 60 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Our remaining valuation allowances as of December 31, 2009 relates to certain of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. If and when we release our remaining valuation allowances, it will have an impact to our financial position and results of operations in the periods such determinations are made. We will continue to assess the need for our valuation allowances, by country or location, in the future. Accounting for Impairment of Goodwill In accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform goodwill impairment reviews annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we completed annual goodwill impairment reviews of both the Europe reporting unit and the Asia-Pacific reporting unit and concluded that there was no impairment as the fair value of these reporting units exceeded their carrying value. We use both the income and market approach in step one of our goodwill impairment reviews and weight the results of both equally. Under the income approach, we develop a five-year cash flow forecast and use our weighted-average cost of capital applicable to our reporting units as discount rates. This requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. These assumptions require significant management judgment and are inherently subject to uncertainties. Future events, changing market conditions and any changes in key assumptions may result in an impairment charge. While we have never recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill to date, the development of adverse business conditions in our Asia-Pacific or European reporting units, such as higher than anticipated customer churn or significantly increased operating costs, or significant deterioration of our market comparables that we use in the market approach, could result in an impairment charge in future periods. As of December 31, 2009, goodwill attributable to the Asia-Pacific reporting unit and the Europe reporting unit was $18.5 million and $362.6 million, respectively. Any potential impairment charge against our goodwill would not exceed the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. 61 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Accounting for Property, Plant and Equipment We have a substantial amount of property, plant and equipment recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The vast majority of our property, plant and equipment represent the costs incurred to build out or acquire our IBX data centers around the world. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets. The majority of our IBX data centers are in properties that are leased. We depreciate our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (subject to the term of the lease in the case of leased assets or leasehold improvements). Accounting for property, plant and equipment involves a number of accounting issues including determining the appropriate period in which to depreciate such assets, making assessments for leased properties to determine whether they are capital or operating leases, capitalizing interest during periods of construction and assessing the asset retirement obligations required for certain leased properties that require us to return the leased properties back to their original condition at the time we decide to exit a leased property. While there are numerous judgments and uncertainties involved in accounting for property, plant and equipment that are significant, arriving at the estimated useful life of an asset requires the most critical judgment for us and changes to these estimates would have the most significant impact to our financial position and results of operations. When we lease a property for our IBX data centers, we generally enter into long-term arrangements with initial lease terms of at least 8-10 years and with renewal options available to us. During the next several years, a number of leases for our IBX data centers will start to come up for renewal. As we start approaching the ends of these initial lease terms, we will need to reassess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment. In addition, we may find that our estimates for the useful lives of non-leased assets may also need to be revised periodically. In many cases, we arrived at these estimates during 1999 when we opened our first three IBX data centers. We reassessed the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment during the third quarter of 2009 and we expect we will continue to periodically review such estimates and further changes in the future are possible. During the third quarter of 2009, we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment. As a result, we recorded $12.0 million of lower depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 due to extending the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment. We undertook this review due to our determination that we were generally using certain of our existing assets longer than originally anticipated and, therefore, the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment has been lengthened. This change was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis effective July 1, 2009 under the accounting standard for change in accounting estimates. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded a $4.2 million decrease in depreciation expense as an out-of-period adjustment related to incorrectly depreciating certain assets. This $4.2 million out-of-period adjustment represents the correction of errors attributable to the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, which we have concluded were not material to any previously-reported historical quarterly periods or results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and to any previously-reported historical annual or quarterly periods for the years ended December 31, 2008 or 2007. 62 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had property, plant and equipment of $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, and for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded depreciation expense of $168.0 million, $152.4 million and $97.9 million, respectively. Further changes in our estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment could have a significant impact to our results of operations.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk The following discussion about market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to impairments of our investment portfolio, changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity. We currently employ interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging certain specifically-identified exposures. The use of these financial instruments is intended to mitigate some of the risks associated with either fluctuations in interest rates or currency exchange rates, but does not eliminate such risks. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Investment Portfolio Risk All of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale and are therefore recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets with the unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income or loss. We consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge for our securities, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. As more fully described in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we incurred an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $2.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively, from our investment portfolio (consisting of a single money market account), of which $3.4 million was recovered in January 2010. If market conditions continue to deteriorate and liquidity constraints become even more pronounced, we could sustain more losses from our investment portfolio. As our securities mature, we have been increasing our holdings in U.S. government securities, such as Treasury bills and Treasury notes of a short-term duration and lower yield. As a result, we expect our interest income to remain low in the forseeable future. As of December 31, 2009, our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market fund investments, commercial paper, corporate bonds, asset backed securities, certificates of deposit and U.S government and agency obligations. Excluding the U.S. government holdings which carry a 63 Table of Contents lower risk and lower return in comparison to other securities in the portfolio, the remaining amount in our investment portfolio that could be more susceptible to market risk totaled $136.6 million. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and variable-rate financings in place in the U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific. The fair value of our marketable securities could be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, but we do not believe such impact would be material. Securities with longer maturities are subject to a greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities and as of December 31, 2009 our portfolio maturity was relatively short. If current interest rates were to increase or decrease by 10% from their position as of December 31, 2009, the fair value of our investment portfolio could increase or decrease by approximately $52,000. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates from their position as of December 31, 2009 would not have a material impact on our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of the majority of our debt obligations. However, the interest expense associated with our Chicago IBX financing, Asia-Pacific financing, European financing and Netherlands financing, which bear interest at variable rates tied to local cost of funds or LIBOR/SIBOR/EURIBOR, could be affected. For every 100 basis point change in interest rates, our annual interest expense could increase or decrease by a total of approximately $3.4 million based on the total balance of our borrowings under the Chicago IBX financing, Asia-Pacific financing, European financing, Singapore financing and Netherlands financing as of December 31, 2009. To mitigate the risk of fluctuations in floating rates, we utilize interest rate swaps (receive floating/pay fixed). As of December 31, 2009, we had a total of four swap agreements outstanding with maturity dates of less than two years, comprised of three swap agreements for the European financing with an aggregate notional amount of 32.5 million British pounds and 25.5 million Euros, or approximately $89.1 million, and one swap agreement for the Chicago IBX financing with an aggregate notional amount of $105.0 million. Under the three swap agreements for the European financing, we pay fixed interest rates ranging from 5.59% to 7.03% (swap rates ranging from 4.46% to 5.91% plus borrowing margin) on the notional amount and the counterparty pays us rates of interest on the notional amount based on LIBOR/EURIBOR. Under the swap agreement for the Chicago IBX financing, we pay a fixed interest rate of 6.34% (swap rate of 3.59% plus borrowing margin of 2.75%) on the notional amount and the counterparty pays us rates of interest on the notional amount based on one-month LIBOR. The fair values or changes in fair value of these swaps are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. As of December 31, 2009, we had an accumulated loss of $8.4 million associated with our interest rate swaps, which is included in the consolidated balance sheet within accumulated other comprehensive loss. 64 Table of Contents The fair value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate changes may affect the fair value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair value of the Company’s convertible debt, which is traded in the market, is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of the Company’s mortgage and loans payable, which are not traded in the market, is estimated by considering the Company’s credit rating, current rates available to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities and the terms of the debt. The following represents the estimated fair value of our convertible debt and mortgage and loans payable as of December 31, 2009 (in thousands): December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 CarryingValue Fair Value CarryingValue Fair Value Convertible Debt: Convertible subordinated debentures $ — $ — $ 19,150 $ 19,290 2.50% convertible subordinated notes(1) 222,943 228,935 212,524 128,552 3.00% convertible subordinated notes 395,986 461,324 395,986 251,451 4.75% convertible subordinated notes(2) 274,777 307,248 — — $ 893,706 $ 997,507 $ 627,660 $ 399,293 Mortgage and Loans Payable: Mortgage payable $ 91,756 $ 83,406 $ 94,362 $ 58,682 Chicago IBX financing 109,991 109,700 109,991 101,665 Asia-Pacific financing 64,559 60,827 87,009 77,030 European financing 130,058 111,375 130,981 93,577 Netherlands financing 9,311 7,941 6,485 6,485 Other note payable — — 9,672 9,672 Singapore financing 24,559 21,739 — — $ 430,234 $ 394,988 $ 438,500 $ 347,111 (1) Total debt principal is $250.0 million, which is subject to a FASB standard for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement). See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (2) Total debt principal is $373.8 million, which is subject to a FASB standard for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement). See Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may enter into additional interest rate hedging agreements in the future to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk. Foreign Currency Risk The majority of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, generated mostly from customers in the U.S. However, approximately 39% of our revenues and 42% of our operating costs are attributable to the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions and a large portion of those revenues and costs are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound, Euro, Swiss franc, Singapore dollar, Japanese yen and Hong Kong and Australian dollars. As a result, our operating results and cash flows are impacted by currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. To protect against certain reductions in value caused by changes in currency exchange rates, we have established a risk management program to offset some of the risk of carrying assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Our risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements and its impact on the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2009, the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of less than one year. 65 Table of Contents For the foreseeable future, excluding the pending Switch and Data acquisition and any other potential acquisitions, we anticipate that approximately 35-45% of our revenues and operating costs will continue to be generated and incurred outside of the U.S. in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. While we hedge certain of our balance sheet foreign currency assets and liabilities, we do not hedge revenue. During fiscal 2007 and the first half of 2008, the U.S. dollar had been generally weaker relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate. This overall weakness of the U.S. dollar had a positive impact on our consolidated results of operations because the foreign denominations translated into more U.S. dollars. However, during the second half of 2008 and through the first quarter of 2009, the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate. This significantly impacted our consolidated financial position and results of operations as amounts in foreign currencies translated into less U.S. dollars. During the last nine months of 2009, the U.S. dollar weakened again relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate, which had a positive impact to our results of operations. In future periods, the volatility of the U.S. dollar as compared to the other currencies in which we do business could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations including the amount of revenue that we report in future periods. We may enter into additional hedging activities in the future to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency risk as our exposure to foreign currency risk continues to increase due to our growing foreign operations; however, we do not currently intend to eliminate all foreign currency transaction exposure. Commodity Price Risk Certain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of price changes are electricity, supplies and equipment used in our IBX data centers. We closely monitor the cost of electricity at all of our locations. We have entered into several power contracts to purchase power at fixed prices during 2010 and beyond in certain locations in the U.S., as well as Australia, Germany, Singapore and the United Kingdom. In addition, as we are building new, “greenfield” IBX data centers, we are subject to commodity price risk for building materials related to the construction of these IBX data centers, such as steel and copper. In addition, the lead-time to procure certain pieces of equipment, such as generators, is substantial. Any delays in procuring the necessary pieces of equipment for the construction of our IBX data centers could delay the anticipated openings of these new IBX data centers and, as a result, increase the cost of these projects. We do not currently employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to address commodity price risk other than the power contracts discussed above.",2023-12-30 20:28:03.630479

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information in this discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements are based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. For example, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist readers in understanding our financial information from our management’s perspective and is presented as follows: • Overview • Results of Operations • Non-GAAP Financial Measures • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements • Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates • Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2010, we issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% senior notes due March 1, 2018 which we refer to as the senior notes offering. On April 30, 2010, as more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed the acquisition of Switch & Data Facilities Company, Inc., referred to as Switch and Data, a publicly-held company headquartered in Tampa, Florida. We refer to this transaction as the Switch and Data acquisition. Switch and Data operated 34 data centers in the U.S. and Canada. The combined company operates under the Equinix name. Overview Equinix provides global data center services that protect and connect the world’s most valued information assets. Global enterprises, financial services companies, and content and network service providers rely upon Equinix’s leading insight and 92 data centers in 35 markets around the world for the safeguarding of their critical IT equipment and the ability to directly connect to the networks that enable today’s information-driven economy. Equinix offers the following data center services: premium data center colocation, interconnection and exchange services, and outsourced IT infrastructure services. As of December 31, 2010, we operated or had partner IBX data centers in the Atlanta, Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Seattle, Silicon Valley, St. Louis, Tampa, Toronto and Washington, D.C. metro areas in North America; France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom in Europe; and Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Shanghai and Singapore in Asia-Pacific. 35 Table of Contents We leverage our global data centers in 35 markets around the world as a global service delivery platform which serves more than 90% of the world’s Internet routes and allows our customers to increase information and application delivery performance while significantly reducing costs. Based on our global delivery platform and the quality of our IBX data centers, we believe we have established a critical mass of customers. As more customers locate in our IBX data centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate as well in order to gain the full economic and performance benefits of our services. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a “marketplace” for their services. Our global delivery platform enables scalable, reliable and cost-effective colocation, interconnection and traffic exchange thus lowering overall cost and increasing flexibility. Our focused business model is based on our critical mass of customers and the resulting “marketplace” effect. This global delivery platform, combined with our strong financial position, continues to drive new customer growth and bookings as we drive scale into our global business. Historically, our market has been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled their telecommunications products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center services market landscape has evolved to include cloud computing/utility providers, application hosting providers and systems integrators, managed infrastructure hosting providers and colocation providers with over 350 companies providing data center services in the United States alone. Each of these data center services providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network services, and outsourced IT infrastructure services. We are able to offer our customers a global platform that supports global reach to 12 countries, proven operational reliability, improved application performance and network choice, and a highly scalable set of services. Our customer count increased to 3,916 as of December 31, 2010 versus 2,612 as of December 31, 2009, an increase of 50%. This increase was due both to the Switch and Data acquisition in April 2010 and organic growth in our business. Our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus net sellable cabinet space available taking into account power limitations. Excluding the impact of the Switch and Data acquisition, our utilization rate decreased to 76% as of December 31, 2010 versus approximately 79% as of December 31, 2009; however, excluding the impact of our IBX data center expansion projects that have opened during the last 12 months, our utilization rate would have increased to approximately 84% as of December 31, 2010. Including the impact of the Switch and Data acquisition, our utilization rate was 74% as of December 31, 2010. Our utilization rate varies from market to market among our IBX data centers across the North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific regions. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain of our high power demand customers. This increased power consumption has driven the requirement to build out our new IBX data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX data centers. We could face power limitations in our centers even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific IBX data center. This could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows. Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and service offerings. As was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors such as demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to break-even and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. Depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements, in order to bring these properties up to 36 Table of Contents Equinix standards. Property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant. Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation, interconnection and managed infrastructure services. We consider these services recurring as our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. In addition, during the past three years, in any given quarter, greater than half of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer’s initial deployment and professional services that we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring as they are billed typically once and upon completion of the installation or professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. However, revenues from installation services are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the term of the related contract or expected life of the services. As a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future. Our North America revenues are derived primarily from colocation and interconnection services while our Europe and Asia-Pacific revenues are derived primarily from colocation and managed infrastructure services. The largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX data centers, utility costs, including electricity and bandwidth, IBX data center employees’ salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment and security services. A substantial majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing IBX data centers or open or acquire new IBX data centers. However, there are certain costs which are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies, that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. We expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will increase in the future on a per-unit or fixed basis in addition to the variable increase related to the growth in consumption by the customer. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months as compared to other times of the year. To the extent we incur increased utility costs; such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, to the extent we incur increased electricity costs as a result of either climate change policies or the physical effects of climate change; such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer contract intangible assets. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees, and other general corporate expenses such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and some depreciation expense. Due to our recurring revenue model, and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature and generally does not grow in proportion to revenue growth, we expect our cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses to decline as a percentage of revenue over time, although we expect each of them to grow in absolute dollars in connection with our growth. This is evident in the trends noted below in our discussion on our results of operations. However, for cost of revenues, this trend may periodically be impacted when a large expansion project opens or is acquired and before it starts generating any meaningful 37 Table of Contents revenue. Furthermore, in relation to cost of revenues, we note that the North America region has a lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue than either Europe or Asia-Pacific. This is due to both the increased scale and maturity of the North America region compared to either Europe or Asia-Pacific, as well as a higher cost structure outside of North America, particularly in Europe. While we expect all three regions to continue to see lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in future periods, we expect the trend of North America having the lowest cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue and Europe having the highest to continue. As a result, to the extent that revenue growth outside North America grows in greater proportion than revenue growth in North America, our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may increase in future periods. Sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses may also periodically increase as a percentage of revenue as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth. Results of Operations Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 include the operations of Switch and Data from May 1, 2010. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 include the operations of Upminster from July 22, 2009. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 include the operations of Virtu from February 5, 2008. Constant Currency Presentation Our revenues and certain operating expenses (cost of revenues, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses) from our international operations have represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues and certain operating expenses. As a result, our revenues and certain operating expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. dollar against major international currencies such as the British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar. In order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present year-over-year percentage changes in our revenues and certain operating expenses on a constant currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, we have presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results. To present this information, our current and comparative prior period revenues and certain operating expenses from entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2009 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2010 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2010 with the year ended December 31, 2009 and average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2008 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2009 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2009 with the year ended December 31, 2008). For the year ended December 31, 2010, our North America operations consisted of the U.S. operations and Canadian operations which were added through the Switch and Data acquisition. 38 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2010 % 2009 % Actual Constantcurrency North America: Recurring revenues $ 748,648 61 % $ 515,780 59 % 45 % 45 % Non-recurring revenues 27,527 3 % 19,709 2 % 40 % 40 % 776,175 64 % 535,489 61 % 45 % 45 % Europe: Recurring revenues 256,570 21 % 212,635 24 % 21 % 25 % Non-recurring revenues 25,223 2 % 15,501 2 % 63 % 65 % 281,793 23 % 228,136 26 % 24 % 28 % Asia-Pacific: Recurring revenues 155,200 13 % 113,434 12 % 37 % 27 % Non-recurring revenues 7,166 0 % 5,450 1 % 31 % 21 % 162,366 13 % 118,884 13 % 37 % 27 % Total: Recurring revenues 1,160,418 95 % 841,849 95 % 38 % 37 % Non-recurring revenues 59,916 5 % 40,660 5 % 47 % 48 % $ 1,220,334 100 % $ 882,509 100 % 38 % 38 % North America Revenues. The increase in North America revenues was primarily due to the impact of the Switch and Data acquisition, which resulted in $153.0 million of additional revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010. The following table presents our North America revenues excluding the impact of the Switch and Data acquisition (dollars in thousands): Years endedDecember 31, Change 2010 2009 $ % North America: Recurring revenues $ 598,860 $ 515,780 $ 83,080 16 % Non-recurring revenues 24,355 19,709 4,646 24 % $ 623,215 $ 535,489 $ 87,726 16 % Excluding the impact of the Switch and Data acquisition, the period over period growth in revenues was primarily the result of an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded $33.0 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. metro areas. We expect that our North America revenues, including those of the acquired Switch and Data operations, will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in the recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions and additional expansions currently taking place in the Atlanta and Dallas metro areas, which are expected to open during the first half of 2011. Our estimates of future revenue growth take account of expected reductions in recurring revenues attributed to customer churn or changes or amendments to customers’ contracts. 39 Table of Contents Europe Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2010, our revenues from Germany, the largest revenue contributor in the Europe region for the period, represented approximately 36% of the regional revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2009, our revenues from the United Kingdom, the largest revenue contributor in the Europe region for the period, represented approximately 36% of the regional revenues. Our Europe revenue growth was due to an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded approximately $29.9 million of revenue from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Amsterdam, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, London, Munich, Paris and Zurich metro areas. Our Europe revenue growth includes a $4.2 million increase in equipment resales for the year ended December 31, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss franc than during the year ended December 31, 2009, resulting in approximately $9.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Europe revenues during the year ended December 31, 2010 when compared to average 2009 exchange rates. We expect that our Europe revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions and additional expansions currently taking place in the Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris metro areas, which are expected to open during 2011. Our estimates of future revenue growth take account of expected reductions in recurring revenues attributed to customer churn or changes or amendments to customers’ contracts. Asia-Pacific Revenues. Our revenues from Singapore, the largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, represented approximately 38% and 36%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Our Asia-Pacific revenue growth was due to an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded approximately $5.4 million of revenue generated from our IBX center expansions in the Hong Kong and Singapore metro areas. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Australian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar than during the year ended December 31, 2009, resulting in approximately $11.2 million of favorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific revenues during the year ended December 31, 2010 when compared to average 2009 exchange rates. We expect that our Asia-Pacific revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in these recently-opened IBX center expansions and additional expansions currently taking place in the Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo metro areas which are expected to open during 2011. Our estimates of future revenue growth take account of expected reductions in recurring revenues attributed to customer churn or changes or amendments to customers’ contracts. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2010 % 2009 % Actual Constantcurrency North America $ 408,769 61 % $ 269,242 56 % 52 % 52 % Europe 176,937 26 % 144,875 30 % 22 % 26 % Asia-Pacific 88,961 13 % 69,303 14 % 28 % 20 % Total $ 674,667 100 % $ 483,420 100 % 40 % 39 % Years endedDecember 31, 2010 2009 Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues: North America 53 % 50 % Europe 63 % 64 % Asia-Pacific 55 % 58 % Total 55 % 55 % 40 Table of Contents North America Cost of Revenues. The increase in our North America cost of revenues was primarily due to the impact of the Switch and Data acquisition, which resulted in $109.6 million of additional cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our North America cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 included $150.4 million and $99.3 million, respectively, of depreciation expense, including $39.6 million of depreciation expense from the impact of the Switch and Data acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2010. Excluding the impact of the Switch and Data acquisition, our North America cost of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2010 was $299.1 million, which represents an increase of 11% from the year ended December 31, 2009. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX center expansion activity. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment on a prospective basis effective July 1, 2009 resulting in a $7.1 million decrease in depreciation expense for the year then ended. Excluding depreciation, the increase was primarily due to overall growth related to our revenue growth and costs associated with our expansion projects, including (i) an increase of $7.2 million in rent and facility costs, (ii) an increase of $4.3 million in utility costs as a result of increased customer installations and (iii) a $3.0 million increase in property tax expense. We expect North America cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business. Europe Cost of Revenues. Europe cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 included $53.7 million and $37.1 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX center expansion activity. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment on a prospective basis effective July 1, 2009 resulting in a $523,000 decrease in depreciation expense for the year then ended and we recorded a $4.2 million decrease in depreciation expense for the year then ended as an out-of-period adjustment related to incorrectly depreciating certain assets. This $4.2 million out-of-period adjustment represents the correction of errors attributable to the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in Europe cost of revenues was primarily the result of costs associated with our expansion projects and overall growth in costs to support our revenue growth, such as (i) $4.2 million of higher compensation expense, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (253 Europe employees as of December 31, 2010 versus 184 as of December 31, 2009), (ii) $3.5 million of costs associated with equipment resales, (iii) an increase of $3.1 million in utility costs arising from increased customer installations and revenues attributed to customer growth, (iv) $2.1 million of higher repair and maintenance costs, (v) $1.3 million of higher rent and facility costs and (vi) $1.2 million of higher third-party services such as security and various consulting services. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss franc than during the year ended December 31, 2009, resulting in approximately $6.0 million of favorable foreign currency impact to our Europe cost of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2010 when compared to average 2009 exchange rates. We expect Europe cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 included $28.1 million and $24.4 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX center expansion activity. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment on a prospective basis effective July 1, 2009 resulting in a $4.4 million decrease in depreciation expense for the year then ended. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily the result of costs associated with our expansion projects and overall growth in costs to support our revenue growth, such as (i) $6.1 million in higher utility costs, (ii) an increase of $4.6 million of rent and facility costs and (iii) $2.1 million of higher compensation expense, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (104 Asia-Pacific employees as of December 31, 2010 versus 85 as of December 31, 2009). During the year ended December 31, 2010, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Australian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar than during the year ended December 31, 2009, resulting in 41 Table of Contents approximately $5.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2010 when compared to average 2009 exchange rates. We expect Asia-Pacific cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business. Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2010 % 2009 % Actual Constantcurrency North America $ 72,944 65 % $ 35,900 56 % 103 % 103 % Europe 24,071 22 % 17,755 28 % 36 % 40 % Asia-Pacific 14,089 13 % 9,929 16 % 42 % 35 % Total $ 111,104 100 % $ 63,584 100 % 75 % 75 % Years endedDecember 31, 2010 2009 Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues: North America 9 % 7 % Europe 9 % 8 % Asia-Pacific 9 % 8 % Total 9 % 7 % North America Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our North America sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to the impact of the Switch and Data acquisition, which resulted in $16.0 million of additional sales and marketing expenses, including $6.0 million of amortization expense for customer contracts, for the year ended December 31, 2010. Excluding the impact of the Switch and Data acquisition, our North America sales and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2010 were $56.9 million, which represents an increase of 59% from the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily due to (i) $14.3 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and headcount growth (147 North America sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2010 versus 112 as of December 31, 2009), (ii) $3.3 million of higher costs related to travel and marketing programs and (iii) $1.1 million of higher bad debt expense. We have been investing in our North America sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue and we anticipate this increased investment will continue over the next several years, including anticipated headcount growth and new product innovation efforts and, as a result, our North America sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues have increased and are expected to continue to increase. In the long-term, we generally expect North America sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to grow our business and invest further in various branding initiatives; however, as a percentage of revenues, we generally expect them to decrease. Europe Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our Europe sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $3.7 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and headcount growth (80 Europe sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2010 versus 55 as of December 31, 2009) and $1.1 million of higher costs related to travel and marketing programs. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Europe sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average 2009 exchange rates. We intend to invest further in our Europe sales and marketing initiatives over the next several years, including 42 Table of Contents anticipated headcount growth and new product innovation efforts and, as a result, we expect our Europe sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to increase accordingly. In the long-term, we generally expect Europe sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to grow our business and invest further in various branding initiatives; however, as a percentage of revenues, we generally expect them to decrease. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $2.7 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (51 Asia-Pacific sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2010 versus 44 as of December 31, 2009); however, our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 included the benefit of a $680,000 accrual reversal associated with adjusting the estimated costs of an annual sales recognition program which is an out-of-period adjustment. This $680,000 out-of-period adjustment represents the correction of errors attributable to the year ended December 31, 2009, which we have concluded was not material to any previously-reported historical annual or quarterly period for the year ended December 31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average 2009 exchange rates. We intend to invest further in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing initiatives over the next several years, including anticipated headcount growth and new product innovation efforts and, as a result, we expect our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to increase accordingly. In the long-term, we generally expect Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to grow our business and invest further in various branding initiatives; however, as a percentage of revenues, we generally expect them to decrease. General and Administrative Expenses.

The increase in our North America general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the impact of the Switch and Data acquisition, which resulted in $21.3 million of additional general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010. Excluding the impact of the Switch and Data acquisition, our North America general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2010 were $134.2 million, which represents an increase of 29% from the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase in our North America general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $20.8 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (396 North America general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2010 versus 298 as of December 31, 2009), (ii) $2.2 million of higher 43 Table of Contents depreciation expense as a result of our ongoing efforts to support our growth, such as investment in systems, (iii) an increase of $2.1 million in professional services related to various consulting projects and (iv) $1.9 million of higher costs related to our headquarters expansion to facilitate our growth. During 2010, we have been investing in our North America general and administrative functions, which has included taking on additional office space to accommodate the headcount growth, as a result of our ongoing efforts to scale this region effectively for growth. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending given the current economic environment, we expect North America general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth; however, as a percentage of revenues, we generally expect them to decrease. Europe General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Europe general and administrative expenses was primarily due to $5.9 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (149 Europe general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2010 versus 109 as of December 31, 2009) and $2.9 million of higher professional services related to various consulting projects to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss franc than during the year ended December 31, 2009, resulting in approximately $865,000 of favorable foreign currency impact to our Europe general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2010 when compared to average 2009 exchange rates. During 2010, we have been investing in our Europe general and administrative functions, which has included taking on additional office space to accommodate the headcount growth, as a result of our ongoing efforts to scale this region effectively for growth. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending given the current economic environment, we expect our Europe general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth; however, as a percentage of revenues, we generally expect them to decrease. Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was primarily due to $1.9 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (128 Asia-Pacific general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2010 versus 105 as of December 31, 2009). During the year ended December 31, 2010, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Australian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar than during the year ended December 31, 2009, resulting in approximately $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2010 when compared to average 2009 exchange rates. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending given the current economic environment, we expect Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth; however, as a percentage of revenues, we generally expect them to decrease. Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $6.7 million comprised of $5.3 million related to one-time termination benefits attributed to certain Switch and Data employees and $1.4 million related to revised sublease assumptions on our excess leased space in the New York metro area. For additional information, see “Restructuring Charges” in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We anticipate that we will incur additional restructuring charges in connection with the Switch and Data acquisition related to one-time termination benefits during 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded reductions of restructuring charges totaling $6.1 million, primarily due to a reversal of a restructuring charge accrual of $5.8 million for our excess space in the Los Angeles metro area as a result of our decision to utilize this space to expand our original Los Angeles IBX data center. Our excess space lease in the New York metro area remains abandoned and continues to carry a restructuring charge. Our restructuring charges all relate to our North America geographic region. 44 Table of Contents Acquisition Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $12.3 million primarily related to the Switch and Data acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $5.2 million, primarily related to the Upminster acquisition and the Switch and Data acquisition. Interest Income. Interest income decreased to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Interest income decreased primarily due to lower yields on invested balances. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 0.18% versus 0.58% for the year ended December 31, 2009. We expect our interest income to remain at these low levels for the foreseeable future due to the impact of a lower interest rate environment, a portfolio more weighted towards short-term U.S. treasuries and from the utilization of cash to finance our expansion activities. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $140.5 million for the year ended December 30, 2010 from $74.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase in interest expense was primarily due to additional financings entered into during 2009 and 2010 consisting of (i) our $750.0 million 8.125% senior notes offering in February 2010, (ii) our $373.8 million 4.75% convertible subordinated notes offering in June 2009 and (iii) our new Asia-Pacific financing in April 2010, of which $120.3 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2010 with an approximate interest rate of 4.86% per annum, which replaced both our previously-existing Asia-Pacific and Singapore financings. This increase was partially offset by our repayment of the Chicago IBX financing in March 2010, the European financing in April 2010 and the Netherlands financing in June 2010. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we capitalized $10.3 million and $12.9 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. Going forward, we expect to incur higher interest expense as we recognize the full impact of our $750.0 million 8.125% senior notes and our new Asia-Pacific financing, although this has been partially offset by repayment of debt, such as the European financing and mortgage payable. We may also incur additional indebtedness to support our growth, resulting in further interest expense. Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Recovery (Loss) On Investments. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a $3.6 million other-than-temporary impairment recovery on investments due to additional distributions from one of our money market accounts as more fully described in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded $2.6 million of other-than-temporary impairment losses on this same money market account. Other Income (Expense). For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we recorded $690,000 and $2.4 million of other income, respectively, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains during the years. Loss on debt extinguishment and interest rate swaps, net. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a $10.2 million loss on debt extinguishment and interest rate swaps, net. See “Loss on Debt Extinguishment and Interest Rate Swaps, Net” in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We did not record any loss on debt extinguishment and interest rate swaps, net, during the year ended December 31, 2009. Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded $13.0 million of income tax expense. The tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily a result of applying the effective statutory tax rates to our operating income adjusted for permanent tax adjustments for the period, partially offset by income tax benefits due to the release of valuation allowances of $5.2 million and $2.1 million associated with certain of our operating entities in Germany and Singapore, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded $39.6 million of income tax expense. The tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily a result of applying the effective statutory tax rates to our operating income adjusted for permanent tax adjustments for the period, partially offset by income tax benefits due to the release of valuation allowances of $3.1 million and $5.2 million associated with certain of our Hong Kong and U.K. operations, respectively. 45 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2009 % 2008 % Actual Constantcurrency North America: Recurring revenues $ 515,780 59 % $ 423,940 60 % 22 % N/A Non-recurring revenues 19,709 2 % 18,863 3 % 4 % N/A 535,489 61 % 442,803 63 % 21 % N/A Europe: Recurring revenues 212,635 24 % 165,669 24 % 28 % 41 % Non-recurring revenues 15,501 2 % 11,833 1 % 31 % 36 % 228,136 26 % 177,502 25 % 29 % 41 % Asia-Pacific: Recurring revenues 113,434 12 % 77,554 11 % 46 % 46 % Non-recurring revenues 5,450 1 % 6,821 1 % (20 %) (20 %) 118,884 13 % 84,375 12 % 41 % 41 % Total: Recurring revenues 841,849 95 % 667,163 95 % 26 % 29 % Non-recurring revenues 40,660 5 % 37,517 5 % 8 % 10 % $ 882,509 100 % $ 704,680 100 % 25 % 28 % North America Revenues. The period over period growth in recurring revenues was primarily the result of an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers, as well as selective price increases in each of our IBX markets. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded $67.7 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Chicago, Los Angeles and New York metro areas. Europe Revenues. Our revenues from the United Kingdom, the largest revenue contributor in the Europe region for the period, represented approximately 36% and 38%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. As in the U.S., Europe revenue growth was due to an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded approximately $49.4 million of revenue from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris metro areas. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss franc than during the year ended December 31, 2008, resulting in approximately $22.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Europe revenues during the year ended December 31, 2009 when compared to average 2008 exchange rates. Asia-Pacific Revenues. Our revenues from Singapore, the largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, represented approximately 36% and 38%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. As in the U.S., Asia-Pacific revenue growth was due to an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers, as well as selective price increases in each of our IBX markets. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded 46 Table of Contents approximately $25.7 million of revenue generated from our IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Hong Kong, Singapore and Sydney metro areas. The decrease in Asia-Pacific non-recurring revenue was primarily due to higher revenue from equipment resales in 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Asia-Pacific revenues was not significant when compared to average 2008 exchange rates. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2009 % 2008 % Actual Constantcurrency North America $ 269,242 56 % $ 238,583 57 % 13 % N/A Europe 144,875 30 % 122,658 30 % 18 % 28 % Asia-Pacific 69,303 14 % 53,558 13 % 29 % 28 % Total $ 483,420 100 % $ 414,799 100 % 17 % 19 % Years endedDecember 31, 2009 2008 Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues: North America 50 % 54 % Europe 64 % 69 % Asia-Pacific 58 % 63 % Total 55 % 59 % North America Cost of Revenues. North America cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 included $99.3 million and $91.9 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense of $14.5 million was due to our IBX data center expansion activity; however, this growth was partially offset by a $7.1 million decrease in depreciation expense as we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2009. Excluding depreciation, the increase in North America cost of revenues was primarily due to overall growth related to our revenue growth and costs associated with our expansion projects, including (i) an increase of $9.8 million in rent and facility costs, (ii) an increase of $7.9 million in utility costs as a result of increased customer installations and (iii) $5.7 million in higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (308 North America employees as of December 31, 2009 versus 289 as of December 31, 2008). Europe Cost of Revenues. Europe cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 included $37.1 million and $33.5 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense of $4.1 million was primarily due to our IBX center expansion activity; however, this growth was partially offset by a $523,000 decrease in depreciation expense as we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded a $4.2 million decrease in depreciation expense as an out-of-period adjustment related to incorrectly depreciating certain assets. This $4.2 million out-of-period adjustment represents the correction of errors attributable to the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, which we have concluded were not material to any previously-reported historical quarterly periods or results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and to any previously-reported historical annual or quarterly periods for the years ended December 31, 2008 or 2007. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in Europe cost of revenues was primarily the result of costs associated with our expansion projects and overall growth in costs to support our revenue growth, such as (i) an increase of $11.0 million of utility costs arising from increased customer installations and revenues attributed to customer growth and (ii) $3.4 million of higher rent and facility costs. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative 47 Table of Contents to the British pound, Euro and Swiss franc than during the year ended December 31, 2008, resulting in approximately $12.1 million of favorable foreign currency impact to our Europe cost of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2009 when compared to average 2008 exchange rates. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 included $24.4 million and $17.6 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense of $11.2 million was primarily due to our IBX data center expansion activity; however, this growth was partially offset by a $4.4 million decrease in depreciation expense as we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2009. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily the result of costs associated with our expansion projects and overall growth in costs to support our revenue growth, including (i) $3.9 million of higher utility costs as a result of increased customer installations and (ii) $2.2 million of higher rent and facility costs. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was not significant when compared to average 2008 exchange rates. Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2009 % 2008 % Actual Constantcurrency North America $ 35,900 56 % $ 38,219 57 % (6 %) N/A Europe 17,755 28 % 19,331 29 % (8 %) 4 % Asia-Pacific 9,929 16 % 9,363 14 % 6 % 6 % Total $ 63,584 100 % $ 66,913 100 % (5 %) (1 %) Years endedDecember 31, 2009 2008 Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues: North America 7 % 9 % Europe 8 % 11 % Asia-Pacific 8 % 11 % Total 7 % 9 % North America Sales and Marketing Expenses. The decrease in our North America sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $1.6 million of higher expenditures related to our branding initiatives in 2008. Europe Sales and Marketing Expenses. The decrease in our Europe sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $1.5 million of lower bad debt expense. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss franc than during the year ended December 31, 2008, resulting in approximately $2.4 million of favorable foreign currency impact to our Europe sales and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2009 when compared to average 2008 exchange rates. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average 2008 exchange rates. 48 Table of Contents General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2009 % 2008 % Actual Constantcurrency North America $ 104,141 67 % $ 96,657 66 % 8 % N/A Europe 33,240 21 % 34,071 23 % (2 %) 10 % Asia-Pacific 17,943 12 % 15,836 11 % 13 % 15 % Total $ 155,324 100 % $ 146,564 100 % 6 % 9 % Years endedDecember 31, 2009 2008 General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues: North America 19 % 22 % Europe 15 % 19 % Asia-Pacific 15 % 19 % Total 18 % 21 % North America General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our North America general and administrative expenses was primarily due to $8.5 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (298 North America general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2009 versus 259 as of December 31, 2008). Europe General and Administrative Expenses. The decrease in our Europe general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a $3.1 million one-time stock-based compensation charge due to equity award modifications related to the resignation of two senior officers in Europe during the year ended December 31, 2008, partially offset by $2.0 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (109 Europe general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2009 versus 80 as of December 31, 2008). During the year ended December 31, 2009, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss franc than during the year ended December 31, 2008, resulting in approximately $4.1 million of favorable foreign currency impact to our Europe general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2009 when compared to average 2008 exchange rates. Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was primarily due to $1.2 million of higher professional fees including legal fees. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average 2008 exchange rates. Acquisition Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $5.2 million, primarily related to the Upminster acquisition and the agreement to acquire Switch and Data. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we did not expense direct acquisition costs pursuant to the accounting standard applicable to that period. Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded reductions of restructuring charges totaling $6.1 million, primarily due to a reversal of a restructuring charge accrual of $5.8 million for our excess space in the Los Angeles metro area as a result of our decision to utilize this space to expand our original Los Angeles IBX data center. Our excess space lease in the New York metro area remains abandoned and continues to carry a restructuring charge. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a restructuring charge adjustment of $3.1 million from revised sublease assumptions on the two excess space leases in the Los Angeles and New York metro areas as a result of new information becoming available. We are contractually committed to the lease of excess space in the New York metro area through 2015. 49 Table of Contents Interest Income. Interest income decreased to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 from $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Interest income decreased primarily due to lower yields on invested balances. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 0.58% versus 2.77% for the year ended December 31, 2008. Interest Expense. Interest expense was $74.2 million and $61.7 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher loan balances as a result of loan drawdowns and new financings entered into during 2008 and 2009 consisting of (i) our $373.8 million 4.75% convertible subordinated notes offering in June 2009, (ii) our Netherlands financing, of which $9.3 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2009 with an approximate interest rate of 4.31% per annum as compared to $6.5 million outstanding as of December 31, 2008 with an approximate interest rate of 4.18% per annum and (iii) our Singapore financing, which we obtained in September 2009, of which $24.6 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2009 with an approximate interest rate of 4.20% per annum. The increase was partially offset by higher capitalized interest expense, repayment of some loans and the partial conversions of certain of our convertible subordinated debentures in November 2008 and June 2009. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we capitalized $12.9 million and $7.9 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Loss On Investments. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we recorded $2.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively, of other-than-temporary impairment losses on one of our money market accounts as more fully described in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Other Income (Expense). For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we recorded $2.4 million and $1.3 million of other income, respectively, primarily attributable to foreign currency exchange gains during the periods. Income Taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded $39.6 million of income tax expense. The tax expense recorded in the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily a result of applying the effective statutory tax rates to the operating income adjusted for permanent tax adjustments for the period, partially offset by income tax benefits due to the release of valuation allowances of $3.1 million and $5.2 million associated with our Hong Kong and U.K. operations, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $87.6 million of income tax benefits primarily due to recognition of deferred tax assets of $85.1 million and $6.1 million associated with our North America and Australian operations, respectively, partially offset by tax provisions from other jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2009, we had total net deferred tax assets of $25.2 million consisting primarily of favorable temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards, the majority of which are attributable to our North America operations. For further information on our income taxes, refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We provide all information required in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but we believe that evaluating our ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, we use non-GAAP financial measures, primarily adjusted EBITDA, to evaluate our operations. We also use adjusted EBITDA as a metric in the determination of employees’ annual bonuses and vesting of restricted stock units that have both a service and performance condition. In presenting adjusted EBITDA, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future operating performance. These items are depreciation, amortization, accretion of asset retirement obligations and accrued restructuring charges, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and acquisition costs. Legislative and regulatory requirements encourage the use of and emphasis on GAAP financial metrics and require companies to 50 Table of Contents explain why non-GAAP financial metrics are relevant to management and investors. We exclude these items in order for our lenders, investors, and industry analysts, who review and report on us, to better evaluate our operating performance and cash spending levels relative to our industry sector and competitors. For example, we exclude depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of our IBX data centers and do not reflect our current or future cash spending levels to support our business. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets, and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of our IBX data centers do not recur and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to our initial investment. This is a trend we expect to continue. In addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of our IBX data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs incurred to build out our IBX data centers, and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. Therefore, we exclude depreciation from our operating results when evaluating our operations. In addition, in presenting the non-GAAP financial measures, we exclude amortization expense related to certain intangible assets, as it represents a cost that may not recur and is not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance. We exclude accretion expense, both as it relates to asset retirement obligations as well as accrued restructuring charge liabilities, as these expenses represent costs which we believe are not meaningful in evaluating our current operations. We exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense as it represents expense attributed to equity awards that have no current or future cash obligations. As such, we, and many investors and analysts, exclude this stock-based compensation expense when assessing the cash generating performance of our operations. We also exclude restructuring charges from our non-GAAP financial measures. The restructuring charges relate to our decisions to exit leases for excess space adjacent to several of our IBX data centers, which we did not intend to build out, or our decision to reverse such restructuring charges or severance charges related to the Switch and Data acquisition. Finally, we also exclude acquisition costs from our non-GAAP financial measures. The acquisition costs relate to costs we incur in connection with business combinations. Management believes such items as restructuring charges and acquisition costs are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs will or may occur in future periods. Our management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. However, we have presented such non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. We believe that the inclusion of this non-GAAP financial measure provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and its ability to perform in subsequent periods. We believe that if we did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze Equinix effectively. Investors should note, however, that the non-GAAP financial measures used by us may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as that of other companies. In addition, whenever we use non-GAAP financial measures, we provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 51 Table of Contents We define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges and acquisition costs as presented below (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Income from operations $ 194,711 $ 181,079 $ 73,262 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 263,564 175,371 160,987 Stock-based compensation expense 67,489 53,056 55,085 Acquisition costs 12,337 5,155 — Restructuring charges 6,734 (6,053 ) 3,142 Adjusted EBITDA $ 544,835 $ 408,608 $ 292,476 The geographic split of our adjusted EBITDA is presented below (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 North America: Income from operations $ 121,118 $ 128,168 $ 66,202 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 173,811 106,207 101,414 Stock-based compensation expense 50,966 40,082 40,993 Acquisition costs 11,094 4,091 — Restructuring charges 6,734 (6,053 ) 3,142 Adjusted EBITDA $ 363,723 $ 272,495 $ 211,751 Europe: Income from operations $ 34,929 $ 31,202 $ 1,442 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 60,291 43,744 41,208 Stock-based compensation expense 9,397 5,843 8,473 Acquisition costs 1,065 1,064 — Adjusted EBITDA $ 105,682 $ 81,853 $ 51,123 Asia-Pacific: Income from operations $ 38,664 $ 21,709 $ 5,618 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 29,462 25,420 18,365 Stock-based compensation expense 7,126 7,131 5,619 Acquisition costs 178 — — Adjusted EBITDA $ 75,430 $ 54,260 $ 29,602 Our adjusted EBITDA results have improved each year and in each region due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in “Results of Operations”, as well as the nature of our business model consisting of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature that is also discussed earlier in “Overview”. We believe that our adjusted EBITDA results will continue to improve in future periods as we continue to grow our business. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2010, our total indebtedness was comprised of (i) convertible debt principal totaling $1.0 billion from our 2.50% convertible subordinated notes (gross of discount), our 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, and our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes (gross of discount) and (ii) non-convertible 52 Table of Contents debt and financing obligations totaling $1.1 billion consisting of (a) $750.0 million of principal from our senior notes, (b) $120.3 million of principal from our loans payable and (c) $261.9 million from our capital lease and other financing obligations. We believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of our current portion of debt due, and to complete our publicly-announced expansion projects. As of December 31, 2010, we had $592.8 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. Besides our investment portfolio and any financing activities we may pursue, customer collections are our primary source of cash. While we believe we have a strong customer base and have continued to experience relatively strong collections, if the current market conditions were to deteriorate, some of our customers may have difficulty paying us and we may experience increased churn in our customer base, including reductions in their commitments to us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. As of December 31, 2010, we had a total of approximately $99.1 million of additional liquidity available to us, consisting of (i) approximately $92.4 million under the new Asia-Pacific financing and (ii) $6.7 million under the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line. While we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our current operating requirements and to complete our publicly-announced IBX expansion plans, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build-out of new IBX data centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as potential acquisitions. While we will be able to fund these expansion plans with our existing resources, additional financing, either debt or equity, may be required to pursue certain of these additional expansion plans. However, if current market conditions were to deteriorate, we may be unable to secure additional financing or any such additional financing may only be available to us on unfavorable terms. An inability to pursue additional expansion opportunities will have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our desired level of revenue growth in future periods. Sources and Uses of Cash Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 392,872 $ 355,492 $ 267,558 Net cash used in investing activities (600,969 ) (558,178 ) (478,040 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 309,686 323,598 145,106 Operating Activities The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2010 compared to 2009 and 2008 was primarily due to improved operating results as discussed above, partially offset by growth in accounts receivable, higher interest paid in cash, payments related to the termination of several interest rate swaps totaling $17.3 million and restructuring charges and acquisition costs paid in connection with the Switch and Data acquisition. We expect that we will continue to generate cash from our operating activities throughout 2011 and beyond. Investing Activities The increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2010 compared to 2009 and 2008 was primarily due to higher capital expenditures as a result of expansion activity, the Switch and Data acquisition and the purchase of the Amsterdam IBX property. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, these capital expenditures were $579.4 million, $369.5 million and $447.0 million, respectively. During 2011, we expect that our IBX expansion construction activity will be similar to our 2010 spending levels. However, if the 53 Table of Contents opportunity to expand is greater than planned and we have sufficient funding to increase the expansion opportunities available to us, we may increase the level of capital expenditures to support this growth as well as pursue additional acquisitions or joint ventures. Financing Activities The net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily due to our $750.0 million 8.125% senior notes offering in February 2010 and approximately $63.4 million of incremental net proceeds from the new Asia-Pacific financing, which replaced our previously existing Asia-Pacific financing and Singapore financing, partially offset by repayment of our debt facilities, including the Chicago IBX financing, the European financing, the Singapore financing, the Netherlands financing and mortgage payable. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily the result of $373.8 million in gross proceeds from our 4.75% convertible notes offering, partially offset by payment of the associated capped call transaction. Going forward, we expect that our financing activities will consist primarily of drawdowns of our new Asia-Pacific financing offset by repayment of our debt for the foreseeable future. Depending on market conditions, we may pursue additional financings in the future. Debt Obligations—Convertible Debt 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes. In June 2009, we issued $373.8 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% convertible subordinated notes due June 15, 2016. Interest is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2009. The initial conversion rate is 11.8599 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. This represents an initial conversion price of approximately $84.32 per share of common stock. Upon conversion, holders will receive, at our election, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2010, the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes were convertible into 4.4 million shares of our common stock. Holders of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes may convert their notes under certain defined circumstances, including during any fiscal quarter (and only during that fiscal quarter) ending after December 31, 2009, if the sale price of our common stock, for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter, is greater than 130% of the conversion price per share of common stock, which was $109.62 per share, on such last trading day or at any time on or after March 15, 2016. Upon conversion, if we elected to pay a sufficiently large portion of the conversion obligation in cash, additional consideration beyond the $373.8 million of gross proceeds received would be required. However, to minimize the impact of potential dilution upon conversion of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, we entered into capped call transactions, which are referred to as the capped call, separate from the issuance of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, for which we paid a premium of $49.7 million. The capped call covers a total of approximately 4.4 million shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment. Under the capped call, we effectively raised the conversion price of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes from $84.32 to $114.82. Depending upon our stock price at the time the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes are converted, the capped call will return up to 1.2 million shares of our common stock to us; however, we will receive no benefit from the capped call if our stock price is $84.32 or lower at the time of conversion and will receive less shares for share prices in excess of $114.82 at the time of conversion than we would have received at a share price of $114.82 (our benefit from the capped call is capped at $114.82 and no additional benefit is received beyond this price). We do not have the right to redeem the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes at our option. We separately accounted for the liability and equity components of our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes in accordance with a FASB standard for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon 54 Table of Contents conversion (including partial cash settlement). See “4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes” in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 3.00% Convertible Subordinated Notes. In September 2007, we issued $396.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Convertible Subordinated Notes due October 15, 2014. Interest is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, and commenced in April 2008. Holders of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes may convert their notes at their option on any day up to and including the business day immediately preceding the maturity date into shares of our common stock. The base conversion rate is 7.436 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. This represents a base conversion price of approximately $134.48 per share of common stock. If, at the time of conversion, the applicable stock price of our common stock exceeds the base conversion price, the conversion rate will be determined pursuant to a formula resulting in the receipt of up to 4.4616 additional shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. However, in no event would the total number of shares issuable upon conversion of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes exceed 11.8976 per $1,000 principal amount of 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, or the equivalent of $84.05 per share of our common stock or a total of 4.7 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2010, the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes were convertible into 2.9 million shares of our common stock. We do not have the right to redeem the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes at our option. 2.50% Convertible Subordinated Notes. In March 2007, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.50% convertible subordinated notes due April 2012. The interest on the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes is payable semi-annually every April 15th and October 15th, and commenced in October 2007. The initial conversion rate is 8.9259 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. This represents an initial conversion price of approximately $112.03 per share of common stock or 2.2 million shares of our common stock. Upon conversion, holders will receive, at our election, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. We intend to repay the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes in cash, through our existing cash balances, refinancing, or a combination thereof. Holders of the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes may convert their notes under certain defined circumstances, including during any fiscal quarter (and only during that fiscal quarter) ending after June 30, 2007, if the sale price of our common stock, for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter, is greater than 130% of the conversion price per share of common stock on such last trading day, which was $145.64 per share, or at any time on or after March 15, 2012. We may only redeem all or a portion of the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes at any time after April 16, 2010 for cash but only if the closing sale price of our common stock for at least 20 of the 30 consecutive trading days immediately prior to the day we give notice of redemption is greater than 130% of the applicable conversion price per share of common stock on the date of the notice, which was $145.64 per share as of December 31, 2010. The redemption price will equal 100% of the principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Upon conversion, due to the conversion formulas associated with the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes, if our stock is trading at levels exceeding 130% of the conversion price per share of common stock, and if we elect to pay any portion of the consideration in cash, additional consideration beyond the $250.0 million of gross proceeds received would be required. However, in no event would the total number of shares issuable upon conversion of the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes exceed 11.6036 per $1,000 principal amount of convertible subordinated notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, or the equivalent of $86.18 per share of 55 Table of Contents common stock or a total of 2.9 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2010, the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes were convertible into 2.2 million shares of our common stock. We separately accounted for the liability and equity components of our 2.50% convertible subordinated notes in accordance with a FASB standard for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement). See “2.50% Convertible Subordinated Notes” in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Debt Obligations—Non-Convertible Debt Senior Notes In February 2010, we issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% senior notes due March 1, 2018, which are referred to as the senior notes. Interest is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2010. The senior notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to our existing or future senior debt and senior in right of payment to our existing and future subordinated debt. The senior notes will be effectively junior to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries. The senior notes are governed by an indenture which contains covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things: • incur additional debt; • pay dividends or make other restricted payments; • purchase, redeem or retire capital stock or subordinated debt; • make asset sales; • enter into transactions with affiliates; • incur liens; • enter into sale-leaseback transactions; • provide subsidiary guarantees; • make investments; and • merge or consolidate with any other person. At any time prior to March 1, 2013, we may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes outstanding at a redemption price equal to 108.125% of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings, provided that (i) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption and (ii) the redemption must occur within 90 days of the date of the closing of such equity offerings. On or after March 1, 2014, we may redeem all or a part of the 8.125% senior notes, on any one or more occasions, at the redemption prices set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the one-year period beginning on March 1 of the years indicated below: Redemption price of thesenior notes 2014 104.0625 % 2015 102.0313 % 2016 and thereafter 100.0000 % 56 Table of Contents In addition, at any time prior to March 1, 2014, we may also redeem all or a part of the senior notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus applicable premium plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption. Upon a change in control, we will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder’s senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. Capital Lease and Other Financing Obligations We have numerous capital lease and other financing obligations with maturity dates ranging from 2011 to 2030 under which a total principal balance of $261.9 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2010 with a weighted average effective interest rate of 8.03%. For further information on our capital leases and other financing obligations, see “Capital Leases and Other Financing Obligations” in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Loans Payable New Asia-Pacific Financing. In May 2010, our five wholly-owned subsidiaries, located in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore, completed a new multi-currency credit facility agreement for approximately $223.6 million, which is referred to as the new Asia-Pacific financing, comprising 79.2 million Australian dollars, 370.4 million Hong Kong dollars, 99.4 million Singapore dollars and 1.5 billion Japanese yen. The new Asia-Pacific financing replaced our previously existing Asia-Pacific financing and Singapore financing. The new Asia-Pacific financing has a five-year term with semi-annual principal payments and quarterly debt service and consists of two tranches: (i) Tranche A totaling approximately $90.8 million was available for immediate drawing upon satisfaction of certain conditions precedent and was used to refinance the existing Asia-Pacific financing and Singapore financing and (ii) Tranche B totaling approximately $132.8 million is available for drawing in Australian, Hong Kong and Singapore dollars only for up to 24 months following the effective date of the new Asia-Pacific financing. The new Asia Pacific financing bears an interest rate of 3.50% above the local borrowing rates for the first 12 months and interest rates between 2.50%-3.50% above the local borrowing rates thereafter, depending on the leverage ratio within our five subsidiaries. The new Asia-Pacific financing contains four financial covenants, which we must comply with quarterly, consisting of two leverage ratios, an interest coverage ratio and a debt service ratio. The new Asia-Pacific financing is guaranteed by us and is secured by most of our five subsidiaries’ assets and share pledges. During the year ended December 31, 2010, our five subsidiaries used part of the proceeds from the partially-drawn down Tranche A and Tranche B under the New Asia-Pacific Financing for the prepayment and termination of the existing Asia-Pacific financing and the Singapore financing. As of December 31, 2010, our five subsidiaries had fully utilized Tranche A and utilized approximately $40.4 million of Tranche B under the new Asia-Pacific financing. The loans payable under the new Asia-Pacific financing have a final maturity date of March 2015. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in connection with the new Asia- Pacific financing. As of December 31, 2010, approximately $120.3 million was outstanding under the new Asia-Pacific financing at an approximate blended interest rate of 4.86% per annum, leaving approximately $92.4 million available for future borrowings under the new Asia-Pacific financing. $25.0 Million Bank of America Revolving Credit Line. In February 2009, we entered into a $25.0 million revolving credit facility with Bank of America, which is referred to as the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line. In February 2011, we amended the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line and extended the maturity date to February 2012. The $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line is used primarily as a letter of credit issuing facility and to fund our working capital if so needed. The effect of issuing letters of credit under the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line reduces the amount available for borrowing under the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line. We may borrow, repay and reborrow under the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line at either the prime rate or at a borrowing margin of 2.75% over one, three or six month LIBOR, subject to a minimum borrowing cost of 57 Table of Contents 3.00%. The $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line contains three financial covenants, which we must comply with quarterly, consisting of a tangible net worth ratio, a debt service ratio and a senior leverage ratio and is unsecured. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in connection with the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line. The $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line has a one-year term and is renewed annually subject to mutual agreement by both parties. As of December 31, 2010, we had issued 13 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $18.3 million under the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line. As a result, the amount available to borrow was $6.7 million as of December 31, 2010. Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements We lease a majority of our IBX data centers and certain equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements expiring through 2035. The following represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 (in thousands): 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 andthereafter Total Convertible debt (1) $ — $ 250,000 $ $ 395,986 $ — $ 373,750 $ 1,019,736 Senior notes (1) — — — — — 750,000 750,000 New Asia-Pacific financing (1) 19,978 24,827 31,493 28,974 15,043 — 120,315 Interest (2) 101,557 97,376 92,940 89,204 78,791 161,390 621,258 Capital lease and other financing obligations (3) 27,959 28,435 28,948 29,660 30,431 237,711 383,144 Operating leases under accrued restructuring charges (4) 2,463 2,429 2,444 2,459 1,444 — 11,239 Operating leases (5) 112,126 116,749 117,158 112,112 94,493 538,357 1,090,995 Other contractual commitments (6) 240,040 75,391 2,044 83 — — 317,558 Asset retirement obligations (7) 445 — 962 1,394 5,437 38,529 46,767 $ 504,568 $ 595,207 $ 275,989 $ 659,872 $ 225,639 $ 2,099,737 $ 4,361,012 (1) Represents principal only. (2) Represents interest on convertible debt, senior notes and new Asia-Pacific financing based on their approximate interest rates as of December 31, 2010. (3) Represents principal and interest. (4) Excludes any subrental income. (5) Represents minimum operating lease payments, excluding potential lease renewals. (6) Represents off-balance sheet arrangements. Other contractual commitments are described below. (7) Represents liability, net of future accretion expense. We entered into 13 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $18.3 million with Bank of America. These letters of credit were provided in lieu of cash deposits under the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line and automatically renew in successive one-year periods until the final lease expiration date or termination of a utility agreement. If the landlords for these IBX leases or utility provider decides to draw down on these letters of credit triggered by an event of default under the agreement, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowing under the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line. These contingent commitments are not reflected in the table above. Primarily as a result of our various IBX expansion projects, as of December 31, 2010, we were contractually committed for $199.4 million of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for IBX equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided in connection with the work necessary to complete construction and open these IBX data centers prior to making them available to customers for installation. This amount, which is expected to be paid during 2011 and thereafter, is reflected in the table above as “other contractual commitments.” 58 Table of Contents We had other non-capital purchase commitments in place as of December 31, 2010, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods or services to be delivered or provided during 2011 and beyond. Such other purchase commitments as of December 31, 2010, which total $118.2 million, are also reflected in the table above as “other contractual commitments.” In addition, although we are not contractually obligated to do so, we expect to incur additional capital expenditures of approximately $200.0 million to $250.0 million, in addition to the $199.4 million in contractual commitments discussed above as of December 31, 2010, in our various IBX expansion projects during 2011 and thereafter in order to complete the work needed to open these IBX data centers. These non-contractual capital expenditures are not reflected in the table above. If we so choose, whether due to economic factors or other considerations, we could delay these non-contractual capital expenditure commitments to preserve liquidity. Other Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements We have various guarantor arrangements with both our directors and officers and third parties, including customers, vendors and business partners (see “Guarantor Arrangements” in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). As of December 31, 2010, there were no significant liabilities recorded for these arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates, among others, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require significant judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain: • Accounting for income taxes; • Accounting for business combinations; • Accounting for impairment of goodwill; and • Accounting for property, plant and equipment. 59 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid. The accounting standard for income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined by the accounting standard as a likelihood of more than 50 percent) such assets will not be realized. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future events. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. If, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account a number of types of evidence, including the following: 1) the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, 2) sources of future taxable income and 3) tax planning strategies. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had total net deferred tax liabilities of $49.1 million and net deferred tax assets of $25.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had a total valuation allowance of $42.0 million and $34.4 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we decided to release our valuation allowance associated with one entity each in Germany and Singapore, which resulted in an income tax benefit of $5.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively, in our results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we decided to release our valuation allowance associated with our Hong Kong operations and one entity in U.K. operations, which resulted in an income tax benefit of $3.1 million and $5.2 million, respectively, in our results of operations. Our decisions to release our valuation allowances were based on our belief that the operations of these regions had achieved a sufficient level of profitability and will sustain a sufficient level of profitability in the future to support the release of these valuation allowances based on relevant facts and circumstances. However, if our assumptions on the future performance of these jurisdictions prove not to be correct and these jurisdictions are not able to sustain a sufficient level of profitability to support the associated deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet, we will have to impair our deferred tax assets through an additional valuation allowance, which would impact our financial position and results of operations in the period such a determination is made. 60 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Our remaining valuation allowances as of December 31, 2010, totaling $42.0 million, primarily relates to certain of our subsidiaries outside of North America. If and when we release our remaining valuation allowances, it will have an impact to our financial position and results of operations in the periods such determinations are made. We will continue to assess the need for our valuation allowances, by country or location, in the future. Accounting for Business Combinations In accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as customer contracts, leases and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date if we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed. Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires assumptions and management’s judgment to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. During the last three years, we have completed several business combinations, the most significant of which was the Switch and Data acquisition for a purchase price of $700.0 million in April 2010. Subsequent to the acquisition, we adjusted the purchase price allocation due to changes in estimates and assumptions; however, in the aggregate, these adjustments had an insignificant impact to our financial statements as of and for the eight months ended December 31, 2010. As fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the purchase price allocation for the Switch and Data acquisition was completed in the fourth quarter of 2010. 61 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we used to complete the purchase price allocation and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, which would be recorded in our statements of operations commencing in 2011. Accounting for Impairment of Goodwill In accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform goodwill impairment reviews annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we completed annual goodwill impairment reviews of the North America reporting unit, the Europe reporting unit and the Asia-Pacific reporting unit and concluded that there was no impairment as the fair value of these reporting units exceeded their carrying value. We use both the income and market approach in step one of our goodwill impairment reviews and weight the results of both equally. Under the income approach, we develop a five-year cash flow forecast and use our weighted-average cost of capital applicable to our reporting units as discount rates. This requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. These assumptions require significant management judgment and are inherently subject to uncertainties. Future events, changing market conditions and any changes in key assumptions may result in an impairment charge. While we have never recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill to date, the development of adverse business conditions in our North America, European or Asia-Pacific reporting units, such as higher than anticipated customer churn or significantly increased operating costs, or significant deterioration of our market comparables that we use in the market approach, could result in an impairment charge in future periods. As of December 31, 2010, goodwill attributable to the North America reporting unit, the Europe reporting unit and the Asia-Pacific reporting unit was $408.7 million, $345.5 million and $20.1 million, respectively. Any potential impairment charge against our goodwill would not exceed the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. 62 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Accounting for Property, Plant and Equipment We have a substantial amount of property, plant and equipment recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The vast majority of our property, plant and equipment represent the costs incurred to build out or acquire our IBX data centers around the world. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets. The majority of our IBX data centers are in properties that are leased. We depreciate our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (subject to the term of the lease in the case of leased assets or leasehold improvements). Accounting for property, plant and equipment involves a number of accounting issues including determining the appropriate period in which to depreciate such assets, making assessments for leased properties to determine whether they are capital or operating leases, capitalizing interest during periods of construction and assessing the asset retirement obligations required for certain leased properties that require us to return the leased properties back to their original condition at the time we decide to exit a leased property. While there are numerous judgments and uncertainties involved in accounting for property, plant and equipment that are significant, arriving at the estimated useful life of an asset requires the most critical judgment for us and changes to these estimates would have the most significant impact to our financial position and results of operations. When we lease a property for our IBX data centers, we generally enter into long-term arrangements with initial lease terms of at least 8-10 years and with renewal options generally available to us. During the next several years, a number of leases for our IBX data centers will come up for renewal. As we start approaching the ends of these initial lease terms, we will need to reassess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment. In addition, we may find that our estimates for the useful lives of non-leased assets may also need to be revised periodically. In many cases, we arrived at these estimates during 1999 when we opened our first three IBX data centers. We reassessed the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment during the third quarter of 2009 and we expect we will continue to periodically review such estimates and further changes in the future are possible. During the third quarter of 2009, we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment. As a result, we recorded $12.0 million of lower depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 due to extending the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment. We undertook this review due to our determination that we were generally using certain of our existing assets longer than originally anticipated and, therefore, the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment has been lengthened. This change was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis effective July 1, 2009 under the accounting standard for change in accounting estimates. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded a $4.2 million decrease in depreciation expense as an out-of-period adjustment related to incorrectly depreciating certain assets. This $4.2 million out-of-period adjustment represents the correction of errors attributable to the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, which we have concluded were not material to any previously-reported historical quarterly periods or results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and to any previously-reported historical annual or quarterly periods for the years ended December 31, 2008 or 2007. 63 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Another area of judgment for us in connection with our property, plant and equipment is related to lease accounting. Most of our IBX data centers are leased. Each time we enter into a new lease or lease amendment for one of our IBX data centers, we analyze each lease or lease amendment for the proper accounting. This requires certain judgments on our part such as establishing the initial lease term to include in a lease test, establishing the remaining estimated useful life of the underlying property or equipment and estimating the fair value of the underlying property or equipment. All of these judgments are inherently uncertain. Different assumptions or estimates could result in a different accounting treatment for a lease. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had property, plant and equipment of $2.7 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recorded depreciation expense of $246.5 million, $168.0 million and $152.4 million, respectively. Further changes in our estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment could have a significant impact to our results of operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk The following discussion about market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to impairments of our investment portfolio, changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity. We currently employ foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging certain specifically-identified exposures. The use of these financial instruments is intended to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, but does not eliminate such risks. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Investment Portfolio Risk All of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale and are therefore recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets with the unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income or loss. We consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge for our securities, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for 64 Table of Contents any anticipated recovery. As more fully described in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we incurred an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $2.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively, from our investment portfolio (consisting of a single money market account), of which $3.6 million was recovered during the year ended December 31, 2010. If market conditions continue to deteriorate and liquidity constraints become even more pronounced, we could sustain more losses from our investment portfolio. As our securities mature, we have been increasing our holdings in U.S. government securities, such as Treasury bills and Treasury notes of a short-term duration and lower yield. As a result, we expect our interest income to remain low in the forseeable future. As of December 31, 2010, our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market fund investments, corporate bonds, asset backed securities and U.S government and agency obligations. Excluding the U.S. government holdings which carry a lower risk and lower return in comparison to other securities in the portfolio, the remaining amount in our investment portfolio that could be more susceptible to market risk totaled $200.9 million. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and a variable-rate financing in the Asia-Pacific region. The fair value of our marketable securities could be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, but we do not believe such impact would be material. Securities with longer maturities are subject to a greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities and as of December 31, 2010 the average duration of our portfolio was less than three months. If current interest rates were to increase or decrease by 10% from their position as of December 31, 2010, the fair value of our investment portfolio could increase or decrease by approximately $14,000. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates from their position as of December 31, 2010 would not have a material impact on our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of the majority of our debt obligations. However, the interest expense associated with our new Asia-Pacific financing, which bears interest at variable rates tied to local cost of funds, could be affected. For every 100 basis point change in interest rates, our annual interest expense could increase or decrease by a total of approximately $1.0 million based on the total balance of our borrowings under the new Asia-Pacific financing as of December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, we had no outstanding interest rate swaps. 65 Table of Contents The fair value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate changes may affect the fair value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair value of the Company’s convertible debt, which is traded in the market, is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of the Company’s mortgage and loans payable, which are not traded in the market, is estimated by considering the Company’s credit rating, current rates available to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities and the terms of the debt. The following represents the estimated fair value of our mortgage and loans payable, senior notes and convertible debt and as of (in thousands): December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 CarryingValue Fair Value CarryingValue Fair Value Mortgage and Loans Payable: New Asia-Pacific financing $ 120,315 $ 126,958 $ — $ — European financing — — 130,058 111,375 Chicago IBX financing — — 109,991 109,700 Mortgage payable — — 91,756 83,406 Asia-Pacific financing — — 64,559 60,827 Singapore financing — — 24,559 21,739 Netherlands financing — — 9,311 7,941 $ 120,315 $ 126,958 $ 430,234 $ 394,988 Senior Notes: Senior Notes $ 750,000 $ 816,270 $ — $ — Convertible Debt: 2.50% convertible subordinated notes (1) $ 234,185 $ 246,280 $ 222,943 $ 228,935 3.00% convertible subordinated notes 395,986 399,946 395,986 461,324 4.75% convertible subordinated notes (2) 286,166 348,786 274,777 307,248 $ 916,337 $ 995,012 $ 893,706 $ 997,507 (1) Total debt principal is $250.0 million, which is subject to a FASB standard for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement). See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (2) Total debt principal is $373.8 million, which is subject to a FASB standard for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement). See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may enter into interest rate hedging agreements in the future to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk. Foreign Currency Risk The majority of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, generated mostly from customers in the U.S. However, approximately 38% of both our revenues and operating costs are attributable to Canada and the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions and a large portion of those revenues and costs are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, Swiss franc, Singapore dollar, Japanese yen, Hong Kong dollar and Australian dollar. As a result, our operating results and cash flows are impacted by currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. To protect against certain reductions in value caused by changes in currency exchange rates, we have established a risk management program to offset some of the risk of carrying assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Our risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements and its impact on the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2010, the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of less than one year. 66 Table of Contents For the foreseeable future, we anticipate that approximately 35-45% of our revenues and operating costs will continue to be generated and incurred outside of the U.S. in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. While we hedge certain of our balance sheet foreign currency assets and liabilities, we do not hedge revenue. During the second half of 2008 and through the first quarter of 2009, the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate. This significantly impacted our consolidated financial position and results of operations as amounts in foreign currencies translated into less U.S. dollars. However, during the second half of 2009 and fiscal 2010, the U.S. dollar has been generally weaker relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate. This overall weakness of the U.S. dollar had a positive impact on our consolidated results of operations because the foreign denominations translated into more U.S. dollars. In future periods, the volatility of the U.S. dollar as compared to the other currencies in which we do business could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations including the amount of revenue that we report in future periods. We may enter into additional hedging activities in the future to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency risk as our exposure to foreign currency risk continues to increase due to our growing foreign operations; however, we do not currently intend to eliminate all foreign currency transaction exposure. Commodity Price Risk Certain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of price changes are electricity, supplies and equipment used in our IBX data centers. We closely monitor the cost of electricity at all of our locations. We have entered into several power contracts to purchase power at fixed prices during 2011 and beyond in certain locations in the U.S., Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom. In addition, as we are building new, or expanding existing, IBX data centers, we are subject to commodity price risk for building materials related to the construction of these IBX data centers, such as steel and copper. In addition, the lead-time to procure certain pieces of equipment, such as generators, is substantial. Any delays in procuring the necessary pieces of equipment for the construction of our IBX data centers could delay the anticipated openings of these new IBX data centers and, as a result, increase the cost of these projects. We do not currently employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to address commodity price risk other than the power contracts discussed above.",2023-12-30 20:28:19.753101

This transaction is referred to as the ALOG acquisition. In July 2011, we issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.00% senior notes due July 15, 2021, which is referred to as the 7.00% senior notes offering. We intend to use the net proceeds from the 7.00% senior notes offering for general corporate purposes, including the funding of our expansion activities, and the repayment of our 2.50% convertible subordinated notes due April 15, 2012. In November 2011, our board of directors, referred to as the board, approved a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $250.0 million in value of our common stock in the open market or private transactions through December 31, 2012, which is referred to as the share repurchase program. The share repurchase program was designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances. Overview Equinix provides global data center services that protect and connect the world’s most valued information assets. Global enterprises, financial services companies, and content and network service providers rely upon Equinix’s leading insight and data centers in 38 markets around the world for the safeguarding of their critical IT 36 Table of Contents equipment and the ability to directly connect to the networks that enable today’s information-driven economy. Equinix offers the following data center services: premium data center colocation, interconnection and exchange services, and outsourced IT infrastructure services. As of December 31, 2011, we operated or had partner IBX data centers in the Atlanta, Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Rio De Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Seattle, Silicon Valley, St. Louis, Tampa, Toronto and Washington, D.C. metro areas in the Americas region; France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom in the Europe, Middle East, Africa (EMEA) region; and Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, China and Singapore in the Asia-Pacific region. We leverage our global data centers in 38 markets around the world as a global service delivery platform which serves more than 90% of the world’s Internet routes and allows our customers to increase information and application delivery performance while significantly reducing costs. Based on our global delivery platform and the quality of our IBX data centers, we believe we have established a critical mass of customers. As more customers locate in our IBX data centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate as well in order to gain the full economic and performance benefits of our services. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a “marketplace” for their services. Our global delivery platform enables scalable, reliable and cost-effective colocation, interconnection and traffic exchange thus lowering overall cost and increasing flexibility. Our focused business model is based on our critical mass of customers and the resulting “marketplace” effect. This global delivery platform, combined with our strong financial position, continues to drive new customer growth and bookings as we drive scale into our global business. Historically, our market has been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled their telecommunications products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center services market landscape has evolved to include cloud computing/utility providers, application hosting providers and systems integrators, managed infrastructure hosting providers and colocation providers with over 350 companies providing data center services in the United States alone. Each of these data center services providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network services, and outsourced IT infrastructure services. We are able to offer our customers a global platform that supports global reach to 12 countries, proven operational reliability, improved application performance and network choice, and a highly scalable set of services. Excluding the ALOG acquisition, our customer count increased to 4,724 as of December 31, 2011 versus 4,300 as of December 31, 2010, an increase of 10%. This increase was due to organic growth in our business. Our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus net sellable cabinet space available taking into account power limitations. Excluding the impact of the ALOG acquisition, our utilization rate increased to approximately 80% as of December 31, 2011 versus approximately 74% as of December 31, 2010; however, excluding the impact of our IBX data center expansion projects that have been open for less than four full quarters, our utilization rate would have increased to approximately 85% as of December 31, 2011. Our utilization rate varies from market to market among our IBX data centers across the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain of our high power demand customers. This increased power consumption has driven the requirement to build out our new IBX data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX data centers. We could face power limitations in our centers even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific IBX data center. This could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows. 37 Table of Contents Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and service offerings. As was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors such as demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to break-even and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. Depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements, in order to bring these properties up to Equinix standards. Property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant. Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation, interconnection and managed infrastructure services. We consider these services recurring as our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. In addition, during the past three years, in any given quarter, greater than half of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer’s initial deployment and professional services that we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring as they are billed typically once and upon completion of the installation or professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. However, revenues from installation services are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the term of the related contract or expected life of the services. Additionally, revenue from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is generally recognized on a cash basis, when no remaining performance obligations exist, to the extent that the revenue has not previously been recognized. As a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future. Our Americas revenues are derived primarily from colocation and interconnection services while our EMEA and Asia-Pacific revenues are derived primarily from colocation and managed infrastructure services. The largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX data centers, utility costs, including electricity and bandwidth, IBX data center employees’ salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment and security services. A substantial majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing IBX data centers or open or acquire new IBX data centers. However, there are certain costs which are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies, that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. We expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will increase in the future on a per-unit or fixed basis in addition to the variable increase related to the growth in consumption by the customer. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months as compared to other times of the year. To the extent we incur increased utility costs, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, to the extent we incur increased electricity costs as a result of either climate change policies or the physical effects of climate change, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer contract intangible assets. 38 Table of Contents General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees, and other general corporate expenses such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and some depreciation expense. Due to our recurring revenue model, and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature and generally does not grow in proportion to revenue growth, we expect our cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses to decline as a percentage of revenue over time, although we expect each of them to grow in absolute dollars in connection with our growth. This is evident in the trends noted below in our discussion on our results of operations. However, for cost of revenues, this trend may periodically be impacted when a large expansion project opens or is acquired and before it starts generating any meaningful revenue. Furthermore, in relation to cost of revenues, we note that the Americas region has a lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue than either EMEA or Asia-Pacific. This is due to both the increased scale and maturity of the Americas region compared to either EMEA or Asia-Pacific, as well as a higher cost structure outside of the Americas, particularly in EMEA. While we expect all three regions to continue to see lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in future periods, we expect the trend of the Americas having the lowest cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue and EMEA having the highest to continue. As a result, to the extent that revenue growth outside the Americas grows in greater proportion than revenue growth in the Americas, our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may increase in future periods. Sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses may also periodically increase as a percentage of revenue as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth. Constant Currency Presentation Our revenues and certain operating expenses (cost of revenues, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses) from our international operations have represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues and certain operating expenses. As a result, our revenues and certain operating expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. dollar against major international currencies such as the Brazilian reais, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar. In order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present period-over-period percentage changes in our revenues and certain operating expenses on a constant currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, we have presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results. To present this information, our current and comparative prior period revenues and certain operating expenses from entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2010 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2011 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2011 with the year ended December 31, 2010 and average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2009 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2010 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2010 with the year ended December 31, 2009). Results of Operations Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 include the operations of ALOG from April 25, 2011. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 include the operations of Switch & Data Facilities Company, Inc., which is referred to as Switch and Data, from May 1, 2010. 39 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2011 % 2010 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas: Recurring revenues $ 996,015 62 % $ 748,648 61 % 33 % 33 % Non-recurring revenues 36,758 2 % 27,527 3 % 34 % 33 % 1,032,773 64 % 776,175 64 % 33 % 33 % EMEA: Recurring revenues 328,355 20 % 256,570 21 % 28 % 22 % Non-recurring revenues 29,867 2 % 25,223 2 % 18 % 13 % 358,222 22 % 281,793 23 % 27 % 21 % Asia-Pacific: Recurring revenues 204,152 13 % 155,200 13 % 32 % 24 % Non-recurring revenues 11,695 1 % 7,166 0 % 63 % 54 % 215,847 14 % 162,366 13 % 33 % 25 % Total: Recurring revenues 1,528,522 95 % 1,160,418 95 % 32 % 29 % Non-recurring revenues 78,320 5 % 59,916 5 % 31 % 27 % $ 1,606,842 100 % $ 1,220,334 100 % 32 % 29 % Americas Revenues. Growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to (i) additional revenues resulting from acquisitions, including $98.0 million of incremental revenue from Switch and Data ($251.0 million of full-year revenue contributions from Switch and Data during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $153.0 million of partial-year revenue contributions during the year ended December 31, 2010) and $46.9 million of additional revenue resulting from the ALOG acquisition, (ii) $8.9 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Chicago and Dallas metro areas and (iii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above. We expect that our Americas revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in the recently-opened IBX data center expansions and additional IBX data center expansions currently taking place in the Dallas, New York, Seattle and Washington, D.C. metro areas, which are expected to open during 2012 and 2013. Our estimates of future revenue growth take account of expected changes in recurring revenues attributable to customer bookings, customer churn or changes or amendments to customers’ contracts. The following table presents our Americas revenues excluding the impact of acquisitions (dollars in thousands): Years endedDecember 31, Change 2011 2010 $ % Americas: Recurring revenues $ 706,462 $ 598,860 $ 107,602 18 % Non-recurring revenues 28,430 24,355 4,075 17 % $ 734,892 $ 623,215 $ 111,677 18 % 40 Table of Contents EMEA Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2011, our revenues from the United Kingdom, the largest revenue contributor in the EMEA region for the period, represented approximately 36% of the regional revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2010, our revenues from Germany, the largest revenue contributor in the EMEA region for the period, represented approximately 36% of the regional revenues. Our EMEA revenue growth was due to (i) $30.0 million of revenue from our recently-opened IBX data center expansions in the Amsterdam, London and Paris metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss Franc than during the year ended December 31, 2010, resulting in approximately $17.3 million of favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA revenues during the year ended December 31, 2011 on a constant currency basis. We expect that our EMEA revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in the recently-opened IBX data center expansions and additional IBX data center expansions currently taking place in the Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris metro areas, which are expected to open during 2012. Our estimates of future revenue growth take into account expected changes in recurring revenues attributable to customer bookings, customer churn or changes or amendments to customers’ contracts. Asia-Pacific Revenues. Our revenues from Singapore, the largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, represented approximately 40% and 38%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Our Asia-Pacific revenue growth was due to an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded approximately $13.0 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX center expansions in the Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo metro areas. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Australian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar than during the year ended December 31, 2010, resulting in approximately $16.2 million of favorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific revenues during the year ended December 31, 2011 on a constant currency basis. We expect that our Asia-Pacific revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in these recently-opened IBX data center expansions and the additional IBX data center expansion currently taking place in the Singapore and Sydney metro areas which is expected to open during 2012. Our estimates of future revenue growth take into account expected changes in recurring revenues attributable to customer bookings, or changes or amendments to customers’ contracts. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2011 % 2010 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas $ 525,250 60 % $ 408,769 61 % 28 % 28 % EMEA 212,967 25 % 176,937 26 % 20 % 13 % Asia-Pacific 129,424 15 % 88,961 13 % 45 % 35 % Total $ 867,641 100 % $ 674,667 100 % 29 % 25 % Years endedDecember 31, 2011 2010 Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues: Americas 51 % 53 % EMEA 59 % 63 % Asia-Pacific 60 % 55 % Total 54 % 55 % 41 Table of Contents Americas Cost of Revenues. Our Americas cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 included $192.7 million and $150.4 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to both our organic IBX data center expansion activity and acquisitions. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in our Americas cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) additional Americas cost of revenues resulting from the impact of acquisitions, such as $42.1 million of incremental cost of revenues from Switch and Data and $25.2 million of additional cost of revenues resulting from the ALOG acquisition, and (ii) an increase of $5.4 million in utility costs as a result of increased customer installations. We expect Americas cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business. EMEA Cost of Revenues. EMEA cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 included $67.0 million and $53.7 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX center expansion activity. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in EMEA cost of revenues was primarily the result of costs associated with our expansion projects and overall growth in costs to support our revenue growth, such as (i) an increase of $8.8 million in utility costs arising from increased customer installations and revenues attributed to customer growth, (ii) $3.6 million of higher compensation expense, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (273 EMEA employees as of December 31, 2011 versus 253 as of December 31, 2010), (iii) $3.1 million increase in property taxes and rent and facility costs , (iv) $2.4 million of higher third-party services such as security and various consulting services and (v) $2.2 million of higher repair and maintenance costs. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss franc than during the year ended December 31, 2010, resulting in approximately $11.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA cost of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2011 on a constant currency basis. We expect EMEA cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 included $46.7 million and $28.1 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX center expansion activity. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily the result of costs associated with our expansion projects and overall growth in costs to support our revenue growth, such as (i) $8.7 million in higher utility costs, (ii) an increase of $5.2 million of rent and facility costs, (iii) $2.7 million of higher compensation expense, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (153 Asia-Pacific employees as of December 31, 2011 versus 104 as of December 31, 2010) and (iv) $2.3 million of higher costs related to customer installations. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Australian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar than during the year ended December 31, 2010, resulting in approximately $9.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2011 on a constant currency basis. We expect Asia-Pacific cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business. Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2011 % 2010 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas $ 104,179 65 % $ 72,944 65 % 43 % 43 % EMEA 36,528 23 % 24,071 22 % 52 % 45 % Asia-Pacific 18,384 12 % 14,089 13 % 30 % 24 % Total $ 159,091 100 % $ 111,104 100 % 43 % 41 % 42 Table of Contents Years endedDecember 31, 2011 2010 Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues: Americas 10 % 9 % EMEA 10 % 9 % Asia-Pacific 9 % 9 % Total 10 % 9 % Americas Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our Americas sales and marketing expenses included $6.4 million of additional sales and marketing expenses from the ALOG acquisition. Excluding the impact of the ALOG acquisition, the increase in our Americas sales and marketing expenses was due to (i) $17.2 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (222 Americas sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2011 versus 189 as of December 31, 2010), (ii) $2.9 million of higher bad debt expense, which is partially due to the revenue growth as discussed above and (iii) $2.4 million of higher recruiting costs and advertising and promotion costs. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our Americas sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts and, as a result, our Americas sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues have increased. Although we anticipate that we will continue to invest in Americas sales and marketing initiatives, we believe our Americas sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues will remain at approximately current levels over the next year but should ultimately decrease as we continue to grow our business. EMEA Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our EMEA sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $8.2 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and headcount growth (117 EMEA sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2011 versus 80 as of December 31, 2010). During the year ended December 31, 2011, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss Franc than during the year ended December 31, 2010, resulting in approximately $1.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA sales and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2011 on a constant currency basis. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our EMEA sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts and, as a result, our EMEA sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues have increased. Although we anticipate that we will continue to invest in EMEA sales and marketing initiatives, we believe our EMEA sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues will remain at approximately current levels over the next year but should ultimately decrease as we continue to grow our business. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $2.7 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (70 Asia-Pacific sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2011 versus 51 as of December 31, 2010). For the year ended December 31, 2011, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was not significant on a constant currency basis. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts and, as a result, our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses have increased. Although we anticipate that we will continue to invest in Asia-Pacific sales and marketing initiatives, we believe our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues will remain at approximately current levels over the next year but should ultimately decrease as we continue to grow our business. 43 Table of Contents General and Administrative Expenses.

Our Americas general and administrative expenses included $6.0 million of additional general and administrative expenses resulting from the ALOG acquisition. Excluding the ALOG acquisition, the increase in our Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $17.0 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (577 Americas general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2011 versus 487 as of December 31, 2010), (ii) $6.2 million of higher depreciation expense as a result of our ongoing efforts to support our growth, such as investments in systems and (iii) $3.9 million of higher professional fees to support our growth. Over the course of the past year, we have been investing in our Americas general and administrative functions to scale this region effectively for growth, which has included taking on additional office space to accommodate our headcount growth. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending given the current economic environment, we expect Americas general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to further scale our operations to support our growth, including further investment in our back office systems; however, as a percentage of revenues, we generally expect them to decrease. EMEA General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our EMEA general and administrative expenses was primarily due to $3.5 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (180 EMEA general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2011 versus 149 as of December 31, 2010). During the year ended December 31, 2011, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss Franc than during the year ended December 31, 2010, resulting in approximately $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2011 on a constant currency basis. Over the course of the past year, we have been investing in our EMEA general and administrative functions as a result of our ongoing efforts to scale this region effectively for growth. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending given the current economic environment, we expect our EMEA general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth; however, as a percentage of revenues, we generally expect them to decrease. Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was primarily due to $3.1 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (153 Asia-Pacific general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2011 versus 128 as of December 31, 2010). During the year ended December 31, 2011, the 44 Table of Contents U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Australian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar than during the year ended December 31, 2010, resulting in approximately $1.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2011 on a constant currency basis. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending given the current economic environment, we expect Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth; however, as a percentage of revenues, we generally expect them to decrease. Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $3.5 million primarily related to revised sublease assumptions on our excess leased space in the New York metro area. Our excess space lease in the New York metro area remains abandoned and continues to carry a restructuring charge. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $6.7 million comprised of $5.3 million related to one-time termination benefits attributed to certain Switch and Data employees and $1.4 million related to revised sublease assumptions on our excess leased space in the New York metro area. For additional information, see “Restructuring Charges” in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Acquisition Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $3.5 million primarily related to the ALOG acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $12.3 million primarily related to the Switch and Data acquisition. Interest Income. Interest income increased to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Interest income increased primarily due to higher yields on invested balances. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2011 was 0.33% versus 0.18% for the year ended December 31, 2010. We expect our interest income to remain at these low levels for the foreseeable future due to the impact of a continued low interest rate environment and a portfolio more weighted towards short-term securities. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $181.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $140.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase in interest expense was primarily due to the impact of our $750.0 million 7.00% senior notes offering, additional financings such as capital lease and other financing obligations to support our expansion projects and additional advances from our Asia-Pacific financing. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we capitalized $11.9 million and $10.3 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. Going forward, we expect to incur significantly higher interest expense as we recognize the full impact of the 7.00% senior notes offering, which is approximately $53.9 million annually. We may incur additional indebtedness to support our growth, resulting in further interest expense. Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Recovery (Loss) On Investments. During the year ended December 31, 2011, no other-than-temporary impairment recovery (loss) on investments was recorded. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a $3.6 million other-than-temporary impairment recovery on investments due to additional distributions from one of our money market accounts as more fully described in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other Income (Expense). For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we recorded $2.8 million and $690,000 of other income, respectively, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains during the periods. Loss on debt extinguishment and interest rate swaps, net. During the year ended December 31, 2011, no loss on debt extinguishment and interest rate swaps, net, was recorded. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a $10.2 million loss on debt extinguishment and interest rate swaps, net. See “Loss on Debt Extinguishment and Interest Rate Swaps, Net” in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 45 Table of Contents Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded $38.4 million of income tax expense. The income tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily a result of applying the effective statutory tax rates to our operating income adjusted for permanent tax adjustments for the period, partially offset by an income tax benefit due to the release of a valuation allowance of $2.5 million associated with our operating entity in Switzerland. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded $13.0 million of income tax expense. The income tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily a result of applying the effective statutory tax rates to our operating income adjusted for permanent tax adjustments for the period, partially offset by income tax benefits due to the release of valuation allowances of $5.2 million and $2.1 million associated with certain of our operating entities in Germany and Singapore, respectively.

Our EMEA revenue growth includes a $4.2 million increase in equipment resales for the year ended December 31, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss franc than during the year ended December 31, 2009, resulting in approximately $9.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA revenues during the year ended December 31, 2010 on a constant currency basis. Asia-Pacific Revenues. Our revenues from Singapore, the largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, represented approximately 38% and 36%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Our Asia-Pacific revenue growth was due to an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded approximately $5.4 million of revenue generated from our IBX center expansions in the Hong Kong and Singapore metro areas. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Australian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar than during the year ended December 31, 2009, resulting in approximately $11.2 million of favorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific revenues during the year ended December 31, 2010 on a constant currency basis. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2010 % 2009 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas $ 408,769 61 % $ 269,242 56 % 52 % 52 % EMEA 176,937 26 % 144,875 30 % 22 % 26 % Asia-Pacific 88,961 13 % 69,303 14 % 28 % 20 % Total $ 674,667 100 % $ 483,420 100 % 40 % 39 % Years endedDecember 31, 2010 2009 Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues: Americas 53 % 50 % EMEA 63 % 64 % Asia-Pacific 55 % 58 % Total 55 % 55 % 47 Table of Contents Americas Cost of Revenues. The increase in our Americas cost of revenues was primarily due to the impact of the Switch and Data acquisition, which resulted in $109.6 million of additional cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our Americas cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 included $150.4 million and $99.3 million, respectively, of depreciation expense, including $39.6 million of depreciation expense from the impact of the Switch and Data acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2010. Excluding the impact of the Switch and Data acquisition, our Americas cost of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2010 was $299.1 million, which represents an increase of 11% from the year ended December 31, 2009. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX center expansion activity. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment on a prospective basis effective July 1, 2009 resulting in a $7.1 million decrease in depreciation expense for the year then ended. Excluding depreciation, the increase was primarily due to overall growth related to our revenue growth and costs associated with our expansion projects, including (i) an increase of $7.2 million in rent and facility costs, (ii) an increase of $4.3 million in utility costs as a result of increased customer installations and (iii) a $3.0 million increase in property tax expense. EMEA Cost of Revenues. EMEA cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 included $53.7 million and $37.1 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX center expansion activity. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment on a prospective basis effective July 1, 2009 resulting in a $523,000 decrease in depreciation expense for the year then ended and we recorded a $4.2 million decrease in depreciation expense for the year then ended as an out-of-period adjustment related to incorrectly depreciating certain assets. This $4.2 million out-of-period adjustment represents the correction of errors attributable to the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in EMEA cost of revenues was primarily the result of costs associated with our expansion projects and overall growth in costs to support our revenue growth, such as (i) $4.2 million of higher compensation expense, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (253 EMEA employees as of December 31, 2010 versus 184 as of December 31, 2009), (ii) $3.5 million of costs associated with equipment resales, (iii) an increase of $3.1 million in utility costs arising from increased customer installations and revenues attributed to customer growth, (iv) $2.1 million of higher repair and maintenance costs, (v) $1.3 million of higher rent and facility costs and (vi) $1.2 million of higher third-party services such as security and various consulting services. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss franc than during the year ended December 31, 2009, resulting in approximately $6.0 million of favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA cost of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2010 on a constant currency basis. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 included $28.1 million and $24.4 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX center expansion activity. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment on a prospective basis effective July 1, 2009 resulting in a $4.4 million decrease in depreciation expense for the year then ended. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily the result of costs associated with our expansion projects and overall growth in costs to support our revenue growth, such as (i) $6.1 million in higher utility costs, (ii) an increase of $4.6 million of rent and facility costs and (iii) $2.1 million of higher compensation expense, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (104 Asia-Pacific employees as of December 31, 2010 versus 85 as of December 31, 2009). During the year ended December 31, 2010, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Australian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar than during the year ended December 31, 2009, resulting in approximately $5.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2010 on a constant currency basis. 48 Table of Contents Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2010 % 2009 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas $ 72,944 65 % $ 35,900 56 % 103 % 103 % EMEA 24,071 22 % 17,755 28 % 36 % 40 % Asia-Pacific 14,089 13 % 9,929 16 % 42 % 35 % Total $ 111,104 100 % $ 63,584 100 % 75 % 75 % Years endedDecember 31, 2010 2009 Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues: Americas 9 % 7 % EMEA 9 % 8 % Asia-Pacific 9 % 8 % Total 9 % 7 % Americas Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our Americas sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to the impact of the Switch and Data acquisition, which resulted in $16.0 million of additional sales and marketing expenses, including $6.0 million of amortization expense for customer contracts, for the year ended December 31, 2010. Excluding the impact of the Switch and Data acquisition, our Americas sales and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2010 were $56.9 million, which represents an increase of 59% from the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily due to (i) $14.3 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and headcount growth (147 Americas sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2010 versus 112 as of December 31, 2009), (ii) $3.3 million of higher costs related to travel and marketing programs and (iii) $1.1 million of higher bad debt expense. EMEA Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our EMEA sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $3.7 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and headcount growth (80 EMEA sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2010 versus 55 as of December 31, 2009) and $1.1 million of higher costs related to travel and marketing programs. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our EMEA sales and marketing expenses was not significant on a constant currency basis. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $2.7 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (51 Asia-Pacific sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2010 versus 44 as of December 31, 2009); however, our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 included the benefit of a $680,000 accrual reversal associated with adjusting the estimated costs of an annual sales recognition program which is an out-of-period adjustment. This $680,000 out-of-period adjustment represents the correction of errors attributable to the year ended December 31, 2009, which we have concluded was not material to any previously-reported historical annual or quarterly period for the year ended December 31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was not significant on a constant currency basis. 49 Table of Contents General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2010 % 2009 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas $ 155,516 71 % $ 104,141 67 % 49 % 49 % EMEA 44,791 20 % 33,240 21 % 35 % 37 % Asia-Pacific 20,474 9 % 17,943 12 % 14 % 8 % Total $ 220,781 100 % $ 155,324 100 % 42 % 42 % Years endedDecember 31, 2010 2009 General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues: Americas 20 % 19 % EMEA 16 % 15 % Asia-Pacific 13 % 15 % Total 18 % 18 % Americas General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the impact of the Switch and Data acquisition, which resulted in $21.3 million of additional general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010. Excluding the impact of the Switch and Data acquisition, our Americas general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2010 were $134.2 million, which represents an increase of 29% from the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase in our Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $20.8 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (396 Americas general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2010 versus 298 as of December 31, 2009), (ii) $2.2 million of higher depreciation expense as a result of our ongoing efforts to support our growth, such as investment in systems, (iii) an increase of $2.1 million in professional services related to various consulting projects and (iv) $1.9 million of higher costs related to our headquarters expansion to facilitate our growth. EMEA General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our EMEA general and administrative expenses was primarily due to $5.9 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (149 EMEA general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2010 versus 109 as of December 31, 2009) and $2.9 million of higher professional services related to various consulting projects to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss franc than during the year ended December 31, 2009, resulting in approximately $865,000 of favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2010 on a constant currency basis. Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was primarily due to $1.9 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (128 Asia-Pacific general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2010 versus 105 as of December 31, 2009). During the year ended December 31, 2010, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Australian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar than during the year ended December 31, 2009, resulting in approximately $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2010 on a constant currency basis. 50 Table of Contents Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $6.7 million comprised of $5.3 million related to one-time termination benefits attributed to certain Switch and Data employees and $1.4 million related to revised sublease assumptions on our excess leased space in the New York metro area. For additional information, see “Restructuring Charges” in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We anticipate that we will incur additional restructuring charges in connection with the Switch and Data acquisition related to one-time termination benefits during 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded reductions of restructuring charges totaling $6.1 million, primarily due to a reversal of a restructuring charge accrual of $5.8 million for our excess space in the Los Angeles metro area as a result of our decision to utilize this space to expand our original Los Angeles IBX data center. Our excess space lease in the New York metro area remains abandoned and continues to carry a restructuring charge. Our restructuring charges all relate to our Americas geographic region. Acquisition Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $12.3 million primarily related to the Switch and Data acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $5.2 million, primarily related to the Upminster acquisition and the Switch and Data acquisition. Interest Income. Interest income decreased to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Interest income decreased primarily due to lower yields on invested balances. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 0.18% versus 0.58% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $140.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $74.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase in interest expense was primarily due to additional financings entered into during 2009 and 2010 consisting of (i) our $750.0 million 8.125% senior notes offering in February 2010, (ii) our $373.8 million 4.75% convertible subordinated notes offering in June 2009 and (iii) our Asia-Pacific financing in April 2010, of which $120.3 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2010 with an approximate interest rate of 4.86% per annum, which replaced both our older Asia-Pacific and Singapore financings. This increase was partially offset by our repayment of the Chicago IBX financing in March 2010, the European financing in April 2010 and the Netherlands financing in June 2010. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we capitalized $10.3 million and $12.9 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Recovery (Loss) On Investments. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a $3.6 million other-than-temporary impairment recovery on investments due to additional distributions from one of our money market accounts as more fully described in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded $2.6 million of other-than-temporary impairment losses on this same money market account. Other Income (Expense). For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we recorded $690,000 and $2.4 million of other income, respectively, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains during the years. Loss on debt extinguishment and interest rate swaps, net. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a $10.2 million loss on debt extinguishment and interest rate swaps, net. See “Loss on Debt Extinguishment and Interest Rate Swaps, Net” in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We did not record any loss on debt extinguishment and interest rate swaps, net, during the year ended December 31, 2009. Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded $13.0 million of income tax expense. The tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily a result of applying 51 Table of Contents the effective statutory tax rates to our operating income adjusted for permanent tax adjustments for the period, partially offset by income tax benefits due to the release of valuation allowances of $5.2 million and $2.1 million associated with certain of our operating entities in Germany and Singapore, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded $39.6 million of income tax expense. The tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily a result of applying the effective statutory tax rates to our operating income adjusted for permanent tax adjustments for the period, partially offset by income tax benefits due to the release of valuation allowances of $3.1 million and $5.2 million associated with certain of our Hong Kong and U.K. operations, respectively. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We provide all information required in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but we believe that evaluating our ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, we use non-GAAP financial measures, primarily adjusted EBITDA, to evaluate our operations. We also use adjusted EBITDA as a metric in the determination of employees’ annual bonuses and vesting of restricted stock units that have both a service and performance condition. In presenting adjusted EBITDA, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future operating performance. These items are depreciation, amortization, accretion of asset retirement obligations and accrued restructuring charges, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and acquisition costs. Legislative and regulatory requirements encourage the use of and emphasis on GAAP financial metrics and require companies to explain why non-GAAP financial metrics are relevant to management and investors. We exclude these items in order for our lenders, investors, and industry analysts, who review and report on us, to better evaluate our operating performance and cash spending levels relative to our industry sector and competitors. For example, we exclude depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of our IBX data centers and do not reflect our current or future cash spending levels to support our business. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets, and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of our IBX data centers do not recur and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to our initial investment. This is a trend we expect to continue. In addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of our IBX data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs incurred to build out our IBX data centers, and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. Therefore, we exclude depreciation from our operating results when evaluating our operations. In addition, in presenting the non-GAAP financial measures, we exclude amortization expense related to certain intangible assets, as it represents a cost that may not recur and is not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance. We exclude accretion expense, both as it relates to asset retirement obligations as well as accrued restructuring charge liabilities, as these expenses represent costs which we believe are not meaningful in evaluating our current operations. We exclude stock-based compensation expense as it primarily represents expense attributed to equity awards that have no current or future cash obligations. As such, we, and many investors and analysts, exclude this stock-based compensation expense when assessing the cash generating performance of our operations. We also exclude restructuring charges from our non-GAAP financial measures. The restructuring charges relate to our decisions to exit leases for excess space adjacent to several of our IBX data centers, which we did not intend to build out or our decision to reverse such restructuring charges, or severance charges related to the Switch and Data acquisition. Finally, we also exclude acquisition costs from our non-GAAP financial measures. The acquisition costs relate to costs we incur in connection with business combinations. Management believes such items as restructuring charges and acquisition costs are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs will or may occur in future periods. Our management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. However, we have presented such non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional 52 Table of Contents tool to evaluate our operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. We believe that the inclusion of this non-GAAP financial measure provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and its ability to perform in subsequent periods. We believe that if we did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze Equinix effectively. Investors should note, however, that the non-GAAP financial measures used by us may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as that of other companies. In addition, whenever we use non-GAAP financial measures, we provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges and acquisition costs as presented below (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Income from operations $ 307,163 $ 194,711 $ 181,079 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 352,653 263,564 175,371 Stock-based compensation expense 71,532 67,489 53,056 Acquisition costs 3,534 12,337 5,155 Restructuring charges 3,481 6,734 (6,053 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 738,363 $ 544,835 $ 408,608 The geographic split of our adjusted EBITDA is presented below (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Americas: Income from operations $ 205,195 $ 121,118 $ 128,168 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 228,739 173,811 106,207 Stock-based compensation expense 56,214 50,966 40,082 Acquisition costs 2,851 11,094 4,091 Restructuring charges 3,481 6,734 (6,053 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 496,480 $ 363,723 $ 272,495 EMEA: Income from operations $ 59,420 $ 34,929 $ 31,202 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 74,486 60,291 43,744 Stock-based compensation expense 8,869 9,397 5,843 Acquisition costs 371 1,065 1,064 Adjusted EBITDA $ 143,146 $ 105,682 $ 81,853 Asia-Pacific: Income from operations $ 42,548 $ 38,664 $ 21,709 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 49,428 29,462 25,420 Stock-based compensation expense 6,449 7,126 7,131 Acquisition costs 312 178 — Adjusted EBITDA $ 98,737 $ 75,430 $ 54,260 53 Table of Contents Our adjusted EBITDA results have improved each year and in each region in total dollars due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in “Results of Operations”, as well as the nature of our business model consisting of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature that is also discussed earlier in “Overview”. Although we have also been investing in our future growth as described above (e.g. additional IBX center expansions, acquisitions and increased investments in sales and marketing expenses), we believe that our adjusted EBITDA results will continue to improve in future periods as we continue to grow our business. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2011, our total indebtedness was comprised of (i) convertible debt principal totaling $1.0 billion from our 2.50% convertible subordinated notes (gross of discount), our 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, and our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes (gross of discount) and (ii) non-convertible debt and financing obligations totaling $2.2 billion consisting of (a) $1.5 billion of principal from our 8.125% and 7.00% senior notes, (b) $256.2 million of principal from our loans payable and (c) $401.8 million from our capital lease and other financing obligations. We believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of the current portion of our debt as it becomes due, and to complete our publicly-announced expansion projects. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, of which approximately $960.0 million was held in the U.S. We believe that our current expansion activities in the U.S. can be funded with our U.S.-based cash and cash equivalents and investments. Besides our investment portfolio and any further financing activities we may pursue, customer collections are our primary source of cash. While we believe we have a strong customer base and have continued to experience relatively strong collections, if the current market conditions were to deteriorate, some of our customers may have difficulty paying us and we may experience increased churn in our customer base, including reductions in their commitments to us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Additionally, approximately 15% of our gross trade receivables are attributable to our EMEA region, and due to the risks posed by the current European debt crisis and credit downgrade, our EMEA-based customers may have difficulty paying us. As a result, our liquidity could be adversely impacted by the possibility of increasing trade receivable aging and higher allowance for doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 2011, we had a total of $125.3 million of additional liquidity available to us under the $150.0 million senior revolving credit facility. While we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our current operating requirements and to complete our publicly-announced IBX expansion plans, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build-out of new IBX data centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as potential acquisitions. While we expect to fund these expansion plans with our existing resources, additional financing, either debt or equity, may be required to pursue certain new or unannounced additional expansion plans, including acquisitions. However, if current market conditions were to deteriorate, we may be unable to secure additional financing or any such additional financing may only be available to us on unfavorable terms. An inability to pursue additional expansion opportunities will have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our desired level of revenue growth in future periods. Sources and Uses of Cash Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 587,609 $ 392,872 $ 355,492 Net cash used in investing activities (1,499,444 ) (600,969 ) (558,178 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 748,728 309,686 323,598 54 Table of Contents Operating Activities The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2011 compared to 2010 and 2009 was primarily due to improved operating results and growth in customer installations. Although our collections remain strong, it is possible for some large customer receivables that were anticipated to be collected in one quarter to slip to the next quarter. For example, some large customer receivables that were anticipated to be collected in December 2011 were instead collected in January 2012, which negatively impacted cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2011. We expect that we will continue to generate cash from our operating activities throughout 2012 and beyond. Investing Activities The increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2011 compared to 2010 and 2009 was primarily due to higher purchases of investments, which were $1.3 billion during 2011 compared to $744.8 million and $379.6 million during 2010 and 2009, respectively. During 2012, we expect that our IBX expansion construction activity will be similar to our 2011 levels. However, if the opportunity to expand is greater than planned and we have sufficient funding to increase the expansion opportunities available to us, we may increase the level of capital expenditures to support this growth as well as pursue additional acquisitions or joint ventures. Financing Activities The net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily due to our $750.0 million 7.00% senior notes offering in July 2011, partially offset by $86.7 million purchases of treasury stock and $33.3 million repayment of our debt. The net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily due to our $750.0 million 8.125% senior notes offering in February 2010 and approximately $63.4 million of incremental net proceeds from the Asia-Pacific financing, which replaced our previous Asia-Pacific financing and Singapore financing, partially offset by $328.6 million repayment of our debt facilities, including the Chicago IBX financing, the European financing, the Netherlands financing and mortgage payable. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily the result of $373.8 million in gross proceeds from our 4.75% convertible notes offering, partially offset by payment of the associated capped call transaction. Going forward, we expect that our financing activities will consist primarily of repayment of our debt for the foreseeable future. However, we may pursue additional financings in the future to support expansion opportunities, additional acquisitions or joint ventures. Debt Obligations—Convertible Debt 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes. In June 2009, we issued $373.8 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% convertible subordinated notes due June 15, 2016. Interest is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2009. The initial conversion rate is 11.8599 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. This represents an initial conversion price of approximately $84.32 per share of common stock. Upon conversion, holders will receive, at our election, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2011, the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes were convertible into 4.4 million shares of our common stock. Holders of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes may convert their notes under certain defined circumstances, including during any fiscal quarter (and only during that fiscal quarter) ending after December 31, 2009, if the sale price of our common stock, for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter, is greater than 130% of the conversion price per share of common stock, which was $109.62 per share, on such last trading day or at any time on or after March 15, 2016. Upon conversion, if we elected to pay a sufficiently large portion of the conversion obligation in cash, additional consideration beyond the $373.8 million of gross proceeds received would be required. However, to 55 Table of Contents minimize the impact of potential dilution upon conversion of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, we entered into capped call transactions, which are referred to as the capped call, separate from the issuance of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, for which we paid a premium of $49.7 million. The capped call covers a total of approximately 4.4 million shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment. Under the capped call, we effectively raised the conversion price of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes from $84.32 to $114.82. Depending upon our stock price at the time the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes are converted, the capped call will return up to 1.2 million shares of our common stock to us; however, we will receive no benefit from the capped call if our stock price is $84.32 or lower at the time of conversion and will receive less shares for share prices in excess of $114.82 at the time of conversion than we would have received at a share price of $114.82 (our benefit from the capped call is capped at $114.82 and no additional benefit is received beyond this price). We do not have the right to redeem the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes at our option. We separately accounted for the liability and equity components of our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes in accordance with a FASB standard for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement). See “4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes” in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 3.00% Convertible Subordinated Notes. In September 2007, we issued $396.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Convertible Subordinated Notes due October 15, 2014. Interest is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, and commenced in April 2008. Holders of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes may convert their notes at their option on any day up to and including the business day immediately preceding the maturity date into shares of our common stock. The base conversion rate is 7.436 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. This represents a base conversion price of approximately $134.48 per share of common stock. If, at the time of conversion, the applicable stock price of our common stock exceeds the base conversion price, the conversion rate will be determined pursuant to a formula resulting in the receipt of up to 4.4616 additional shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. However, in no event would the total number of shares issuable upon conversion of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes exceed 11.8976 per $1,000 principal amount of 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, or the equivalent of $84.05 per share of our common stock or a total of 4.7 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2011, the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes were convertible into 2.9 million shares of our common stock. We do not have the right to redeem the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes at our option. 2.50% Convertible Subordinated Notes. In March 2007, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.50% convertible subordinated notes due April 2012. The interest on the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes is payable semi-annually every April 15th and October 15th, and commenced in October 2007. The initial conversion rate is 8.9259 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. This represents an initial conversion price of approximately $112.03 per share of common stock or 2.2 million shares of our common stock. Upon conversion, holders will receive, at our election, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. We intend to repay the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes in cash, through our existing cash balances, refinancing, or a combination thereof. Holders of the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes may convert their notes under certain defined circumstances, including during any fiscal quarter (and only during that fiscal quarter) ending after June 30, 2007, if the sale price of our common stock, for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter, is greater than 130% of the conversion price per share of common stock on such last trading day, which was $145.64 per share, or at any time on or after March 15, 2012. 56 Table of Contents We may only redeem all or a portion of the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes at any time after April 16, 2010 for cash but only if the closing sale price of our common stock for at least 20 of the 30 consecutive trading days immediately prior to the day we give notice of redemption is greater than 130% of the applicable conversion price per share of common stock on the date of the notice, which was $145.64 per share as of December 31, 2011. The redemption price will equal 100% of the principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Upon conversion, due to the conversion formulas associated with the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes, if our stock is trading at levels exceeding $112.03 per share, and if we elect to pay any portion of the consideration in cash, additional consideration beyond the $250.0 million of gross proceeds received would be required. However, in no event would the total number of shares issuable upon conversion of the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes exceed 11.6036 per $1,000 principal amount of convertible subordinated notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, or the equivalent of $86.18 per share of common stock or a total of 2.9 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2011, the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes were convertible into 2.2 million shares of our common stock. We separately accounted for the liability and equity components of our 2.50% convertible subordinated notes in accordance with a FASB standard for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement). See “2.50% Convertible Subordinated Notes” in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Debt Obligations—Non-Convertible Debt Senior Notes 7.00% Senior Notes. In July 2011, we issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.00% senior notes due July 15, 2021, which are referred to as the 7.00% senior notes. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing on January 15, 2012. The 7.00% senior notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to our existing or future senior debt and senior in right of payment to our existing and future subordinated debt. The 7.00% senior notes are effectively junior to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries. The 7.00% senior notes are also structurally subordinated to all debt and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries and will continue to be subordinated to the extent that these subsidiaries do not guarantee the 7.00% senior notes in the future. The 7.00% Senior Notes are governed by an indenture which contains covenants that limit the Company’s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to, among other things: • incur additional debt; • pay dividends or make other restricted payments; • purchase, redeem or retire capital stock or subordinated debt; • make asset sales; • enter into transactions with affiliates; • incur liens; • enter into sale-leaseback transactions; • provide subsidiary guarantees; • make investments; and • merge or consolidate with any other person. 57 Table of Contents At any time prior to July 15, 2014, we may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 7.00% senior notes outstanding at a redemption price equal to 107.000% of the principal amount of the 7.00% senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings, provided that (i) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the 7.00% senior notes issued remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption and (ii) the redemption must occur within 90 days of the date of the closing of such equity offerings. On or after July 15, 2016, we may redeem all or a part of the 7.00% senior notes, on any one or more occasions, at the redemption prices set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, up to, but not including, the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on July 15 of the years indicated below: Redemption price of theSenior Notes 2016 103.500 % 2017 102.333 % 2018 101.167 % 2019 and thereafter 100.000 % In addition, at any time prior to July 15, 2016, we may also redeem all or a part of the 7.00% senior notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 7.00% senior notes redeemed plus applicable premium, which is referred to as the applicable premium, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption, which is referred to as the redemption date. The applicable premium means the greater of: • 1.0% of the principal amount of the 7.00% senior notes to be redeemed; and • the excess of: (a) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the redemption price of the 7.00% senior notes to be redeemed at July 15, 2016 as shown in the above table, plus (ii) all required interest payments due on these 7.00% senior notes through July 15, 2016 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including the redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the yield to maturity as of the redemption date of the United States Treasury securities with a constant maturity most nearly equal to the period from the redemption date to July 15, 2016, plus 0.50%; over (b) the principal amount of the 7.00% senior notes to be redeemed. Upon a change in control, we will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder’s 7.00% senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. Debt issuance costs related to the 7.00% senior notes, net of amortization, were $13.6 million as of December 31, 2011. 8.125% Senior Notes. In February 2010, we issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% senior notes due March 1, 2018, which are referred to as the senior notes. Interest is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2010. The senior notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to our existing or future senior debt and senior in right of payment to our existing and future subordinated debt. The senior notes will be effectively junior to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries. The senior notes are governed by an indenture which contains covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things: • incur additional debt; • pay dividends or make other restricted payments; 58 Table of Contents • purchase, redeem or retire capital stock or subordinated debt; • make asset sales; • enter into transactions with affiliates; • incur liens; • enter into sale-leaseback transactions; • provide subsidiary guarantees; • make investments; and • merge or consolidate with any other person. At any time prior to March 1, 2013, we may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes outstanding at a redemption price equal to 108.125% of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings, provided that (i) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption and (ii) the redemption must occur within 90 days of the date of the closing of such equity offerings. On or after March 1, 2014, we may redeem all or a part of the 8.125% senior notes, on any one or more occasions, at the redemption prices set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the one-year period beginning on March 1 of the years indicated below: Redemption price of thesenior notes 2014 104.0625 % 2015 102.0313 % 2016 and thereafter 100.0000 % In addition, at any time prior to March 1, 2014, we may also redeem all or a part of the senior notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus applicable premium plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption. Upon a change in control, we will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder’s senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. Loans Payable Senior Revolving Credit Line. In September 2011, we entered into a $150.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders, which is referred to as the lenders. This transaction is referred to as the senior revolving credit line. The senior revolving credit line replaced our $25.0 million credit facility with Bank of America, which is referred to as the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line. As a result, the outstanding letters of credit issued under the $25.0 million Bank of America revolving credit line were all transferred to the senior revolving credit line. We may use the senior revolving credit line for working capital, capital expenditures, issuance of letters of credit, general corporate purposes and to refinance a portion of our existing debt obligations. The senior revolving credit line has a five-year term and allows us to borrow, repay and re-borrow over the term. The senior revolving credit line provides a sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit of up to $100.0 million and a sublimit for swing line borrowings of up to $25.0 million. Borrowings under the senior revolving credit line carry an interest rate of US$ LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75% per annum, which varies as a function of our senior leverage ratio. We are also subject to a quarterly non-utilization fee ranging from 0.30% to 0.40% per annum, pricing of which will also vary as a function of our 59 Table of Contents senior leverage ratio. Additionally, we may increase the size of the senior revolving credit line at our election by up to $100.0 million, subject to approval by the lenders and based on current market conditions. The senior revolving credit line contains several financial covenants, which we must comply with quarterly, including a leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum net worth covenant. As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in connection with the senior revolving credit line. As of December 31, 2011, we had 15 irrevocable letters of credit totaling approximately $24.7 million issued and outstanding under the senior revolving credit line. As a result, the amount available to borrow was $125.3 million as of December 31, 2011. Paris 4 IBX Financing. In March 2011, we entered into two agreements with two unrelated parties to purchase and develop a building that will ultimately become our fourth IBX data center in the Paris metro area. The first agreement, as amended, allowed us the right to purchase the property for a total fee of approximately $19.4 million, payable to a company that held exclusive rights (including power rights) to the property and was already in the process of developing the property into a data center and will now, instead, become the anchor tenant in the Paris 4 IBX data center once it is open for business. The second agreement was entered into with the developer of the property and allowed us to take immediate title to the building and associated land and also requires the developer to construct the data center to our specifications and deliver the completed data center to us in July 2012 for a total fee of approximately $99.7 million. Both agreements include extended payment terms. We made payments under both agreements totaling approximately $35.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 and the remaining payments due totaling approximately $83.3 million are payable on various dates through March 2013, which is referred to as the Paris 4 IBX financing. Of the amounts paid or payable under the Paris 4 IBX financing, a total of $15.0 million was allocated to land and building assets, $3.3 million was allocated to a deferred charge, which will be netted against revenue associated with the anchor tenant of the Paris 4 IBX data center over the term of the customer contract, and the remainder totaling $100.9 million was or will be allocated to construction costs inclusive of interest charges. We have imputed an interest rate of 7.86% per annum on the Paris 4 IBX financing as of December 31, 2011. We will record additional construction costs and increase the Paris 4 IBX financing liability over the course of the construction period. The Paris 4 IBX financing also required us to post approximately $87.9 million of cash into a restricted cash account to ensure liquidity for the developer during the construction period. In January and February 2012, we made payments of approximately $48.3 million from the restricted cash account under the Paris 4 IBX Financing. Asia-Pacific Financing. In May 2010, our five wholly-owned subsidiaries, located in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore, completed a new multi-currency credit facility agreement for approximately $225.1 million, which is referred to as the Asia-Pacific financing, comprising 79.2 million Australian dollars, 370.4 million Hong Kong dollars, 99.4 million Singapore dollars and 1.5 billion Japanese yen. The Asia-Pacific financing replaced our previous Asia-Pacific financing and Singapore financing. The Asia-Pacific financing has a five-year term with semi-annual principal payments and quarterly debt service and consists of two tranches: (i) Tranche A totaling approximately $90.8 million was available for immediate drawing upon satisfaction of certain conditions precedent and was used to refinance the older Asia-Pacific financing and Singapore financing and (ii) Tranche B totaling approximately $132.8 million was available for drawing in Australian, Hong Kong and Singapore dollars only for up to 24 months following the effective date of the Asia-Pacific financing. The Asia Pacific financing bears an interest rate of 3.50% above the local borrowing rates for the first 12 months and interest rates between 2.50%-3.50% above the local borrowing rates thereafter, depending on the leverage ratio within our five subsidiaries. The Asia-Pacific financing contains four financial covenants, which we must comply with quarterly, consisting of two leverage ratios, an interest coverage ratio and a debt service ratio. The Asia-Pacific financing is guaranteed by us and is secured by most of our five subsidiaries’ assets and share pledges. As of December 31, 2011, our five subsidiaries had fully utilized Tranche A and Tranche B under the Asia-Pacific financing. The loans payable under the Asia-Pacific financing have a final maturity date of March 2015. As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in connection with the Asia-Pacific financing. As of December 31, 2011, approximately $193.8 million was outstanding under the Asia-Pacific financing at an approximate blended interest rate of 5.40% per annum. 60 Table of Contents Capital Lease and Other Financing Obligations We have numerous capital lease and other financing obligations with maturity dates ranging from 2012 to 2030 under which a total principal balance of $401.8 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2011 with a weighted average effective interest rate of 7.99%. For further information on our capital leases and other financing obligations, see “Capital Leases and Other Financing Obligations” in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements We lease a majority of our IBX data centers and certain land and equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements expiring through 2035. The following represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 (in thousands): 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Convertible debt (1) $ 250,000 $ — $ 395,986 $ — $ — $ 373,750 $ 1,019,736 Senior notes (1) — — — — — 1,500,000 1,500,000 Asia-Pacific financing (1) 36,206 58,178 64,393 35,066 — — 193,843 Paris 4 IBX financing (2) 79,838 6,089 — — — — 85,927 ALOG debt (1) 4,640 2,252 3,370 22 4 — 10,288 Interest (3) 156,860 150,047 144,110 131,513 122,314 354,075 1,058,919 Capital lease and other financing obligations (4) 39,699 42,606 46,476 49,603 49,702 385,695 613,781 Operating leases under accrued restructuring charges (5) 2,429 2,444 2,459 1,445 — — 8,777 Operating leases (6) 113,764 116,527 111,694 94,594 82,938 468,565 988,082 Other contractual commitments (7) 426,688 41,184 9,117 — — — 476,989 Asset retirement obligations (8) 344 1,053 1,285 5,840 48,065 — 56,587 ALOG acquisition contingent consideration (9) — 19,285 — — — — 19,285 Redeemable non-controlling interests — — 67,601 — — — 67,601 $ 1,110,468 $ 439,665 $ 846,491 $ 318,083 $ 303,023 $ 3,082,085 $ 6,099,815 (1) Represents principal only. (2) Represents total payments to be made to complete the construction of the Paris 4 IBX center.

(4) Represents principal and interest. (5) Excludes any subrental income. (6) Represents minimum operating lease payments, excluding potential lease renewals. (7) Represents off-balance sheet arrangements. Other contractual commitments are described below. (8) Represents liability, net of future accretion expense. (9) Represents an off-balance sheet arrangement for the ALOG acquisition contingent consideration and includes the portion of the contingent consideration that will be funded by Riverwood. In connection with certain of our leases, we entered into 15 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $24.7 million under the senior revolving credit line. These letters of credit were provided in lieu of cash deposits under the senior revolving credit line. If the landlords for these IBX leases decide to draw down on these letters of credit triggered by an event of default under the lease, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowing under the senior revolving credit line. These contingent commitments are not reflected in the table above. 61 Table of Contents We had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaling approximately $22.2 million as of December 31, 2011. These liabilities, which are reflected on our balance sheet, are not reflected in the table above since it is unclear when these liabilities will be paid. Primarily as a result of our various IBX expansion projects, as of December 31, 2011, we were contractually committed for $338.7 million of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for IBX equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided in connection with the work necessary to complete construction and open these IBX data centers prior to making them available to customers for installation. This amount, which is expected to be paid during 2012, is reflected in the table above as “other contractual commitments.” We had other non-capital purchase commitments in place as of December 31, 2011, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods or services to be delivered or provided during 2012 and beyond. Such other purchase commitments as of December 31, 2011, which total $138.3 million, are also reflected in the table above as “other contractual commitments.” In addition, although we are not contractually obligated to do so, we expect to incur additional capital expenditures of approximately $150.0 million to $200.0 million, in addition to the $338.7 million in contractual commitments discussed above as of December 31, 2011, in our various IBX expansion projects during 2012 and thereafter in order to complete the work needed to open these IBX data centers. These non-contractual capital expenditures are not reflected in the table above. If we so choose, whether due to economic factors or other considerations, we could delay these non-contractual capital expenditure commitments to preserve liquidity. Other Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements We have various guarantor arrangements with both our directors and officers and third parties, including customers, vendors and business partners (see “Guarantor Arrangements” in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). As of December 31, 2011, there were no significant liabilities recorded for these arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates, among others, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require significant judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain: • Accounting for income taxes; • Accounting for business combinations; • Accounting for impairment of goodwill; and • Accounting for property, plant and equipment. 62 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid. The accounting standard for income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined by the accounting standard as a likelihood of more than 50%) such assets will not be realized. A tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authority’s widely understood administrative practices and precedents. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future events. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. If, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account a number of types of evidence, including the following: 1) the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, 2) sources of future taxable income and 3) tax planning strategies. In assessing the tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position, the tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had total net deferred tax liabilities of $58.7 million and $49.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had a total valuation allowance of $39.6 million and $42.0 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we decided to release the valuation allowance associated with an entity in Switzerland which resulted in an income tax benefit of $2.5 million in our results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we decided to release our valuation allowance associated with one entity each in Germany and Singapore, which resulted in an income tax benefit of $5.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively, in our results of operations. Our decisions to release our valuation allowances were based on our belief that the operations of these regions had achieved a sufficient level of profitability and will sustain a sufficient level of profitability in the future to support the release of these valuation allowances based on relevant facts and circumstances. However, if our assumptions on the future performance of these jurisdictions prove not to be correct and these jurisdictions are not able to sustain a sufficient level of profitability to support the associated deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet, we will have to impair our deferred tax assets through an additional valuation allowance, which would impact our financial position and results of operations in the period such a determination is made. Our remaining valuation allowances as of December 31, 2011 total $39.6 million and primarily relates to certain of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. If and when we release our remaining valuation allowances, it will have a favorable impact to our financial position and results of operations in the periods such determinations are made. We will continue to assess the need for our valuation allowances, by country or location, in the future. 63 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $43.6 million and $16.6 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the unrecognized tax benefits increased by $27.0 million primarily as a result of the ALOG Acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the unrecognized tax benefits increased by $15.0 million primarily as a result of the Switch and Data Acquisition. The unrecognized tax benefits of $43.6 million as of December 31, 2011, if subsequently recognized, will affect the Company’s effective tax rate favorably at the time when such benefit is recognized. Accounting for Business Combinations In accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as customer contracts, leases and any other significant assets or liabilities and contingent consideration. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date if we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed. Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires assumptions and management’s judgment to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. During the last three years, we have completed several business combinations, including the ALOG acquisition and Switch and Data acquisition in April 2011 and April 2010, respectively. Subsequent to the Switch and Data acquisition, we adjusted the purchase price allocation due to changes in estimates and assumptions; however, in the aggregate, these adjustments had an insignificant impact to our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2010. The purchase price allocation for the Switch and Data acquisition was completed in the fourth quarter of 2010. Our measurement period for the ALOG acquisition will remain open through the second quarter of 2012. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we used to complete the purchase price allocations and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, which would be recorded in our statements of operations commencing in 2012. 64 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Accounting for Impairment of Goodwill In accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform goodwill impairment reviews annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we early adopted the accounting standard update for testing goodwill for impairment. The accounting standard update provides companies with the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If, after assessing the qualitative factors, a company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. However, if a company concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we completed annual goodwill impairment reviews of the Americas reporting unit, the EMEA reporting unit and the Asia-Pacific reporting unit and concluded that there was no impairment as the fair value of Americas reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the EMEA and Asia-Pacific reporting units was less than their respective carrying values. When we elect to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test, we use both the income and market approach. Under the income approach, we develop a five-year cash flow forecast and use our weighted-average cost of capital applicable to our reporting units as discount rates. This requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. When we elect to perform the goodwill impairment test by assessing qualitative factors determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value requires assumptions and estimates, the assessment also requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. These assumptions require significant management judgment and are inherently subject to uncertainties. Future events, changing market conditions and any changes in key assumptions may result in an impairment charge. While we have never recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill to date, the development of adverse business conditions in our Americas, EMEA or Asia-Pacific reporting units, such as higher than anticipated customer churn or significantly increased operating costs, or significant deterioration of our market comparables that we use in the market approach, could result in an impairment charge in future periods. As of December 31, 2011, goodwill attributable to the Americas reporting unit, the EMEA reporting unit and the Asia-Pacific reporting unit was $499.5 million, $347.0 million and $20.0 million, respectively. Any potential impairment charge against our goodwill would not exceed the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. 65 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Accounting for Property, Plant and Equipment We have a substantial amount of property, plant and equipment recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The vast majority of our property, plant and equipment represent the costs incurred to build out or acquire our IBX data centers around the world. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets. The majority of our IBX data centers are in properties that are leased. We depreciate our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (subject to the term of the lease in the case of leased assets or leasehold improvements). Accounting for property, plant and equipment involves a number of accounting issues including determining the appropriate period in which to depreciate such assets, making assessments for leased properties to determine whether they are capital or operating leases, capitalizing interest during periods of construction and assessing the asset retirement obligations required for certain leased properties that require us to return the leased properties back to their original condition at the time we decide to exit a leased property. While there are numerous judgments and uncertainties involved in accounting for property, plant and equipment that are significant, arriving at the estimated useful life of an asset requires the most critical judgment for us and changes to these estimates would have the most significant impact to our financial position and results of operations. When we lease a property for our IBX data centers, we generally enter into long-term arrangements with initial lease terms of at least 8-10 years and with renewal options generally available to us. During the next several years, a number of leases for our IBX data centers will come up for renewal. As we start approaching the end of these initial lease terms, we will need to reassess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment. In addition, we may find that our estimates for the useful lives of non-leased assets may also need to be revised periodically. In many cases, we arrived at these estimates during 1999 when we opened our first three IBX data centers. We reassessed the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment during the third quarter of 2009 and we expect we will continue to periodically review such estimates and further changes in the future are possible. During the third quarter of 2009, we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment. As a result, we recorded $12.0 million of lower depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 due to extending the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment. We undertook this review due to our determination that we were generally using certain of our existing assets longer than originally anticipated and, therefore, the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment has been lengthened. This change was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis effective July 1, 2009 under the accounting standard for change in accounting estimates. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded a $4.2 million decrease in depreciation expense as an out-of-period adjustment related to incorrectly depreciating certain assets. This $4.2 million out-of-period adjustment represents the correction of errors attributable to the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, which we have concluded were not material to any previously-reported historical quarterly periods or results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and to any previously-reported historical annual or quarterly periods for the years ended December 31, 2008 or 2007. 66 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Another area of judgment for us in connection with our property, plant and equipment is related to lease accounting. Most of our IBX data centers are leased. Each time we enter into a new lease or lease amendment for one of our IBX data centers, we analyze each lease or lease amendment for the proper accounting. This requires certain judgments on our part such as establishing the initial lease term to include in a lease test, establishing the remaining estimated useful life of the underlying property or equipment and estimating the fair value of the underlying property or equipment. All of these judgments are inherently uncertain. Different assumptions or estimates could result in a different accounting treatment for a lease. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had property, plant and equipment of $3.2 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded depreciation expense of $328.6 million, $246.5 million and $168.0 million, respectively. Further changes in our estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment could have a significant impact to our results of operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk The following discussion about market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to impairments of our investment portfolio, changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity. We currently employ foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging certain specifically-identified exposures. The use of these financial instruments is intended to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, but does not eliminate such risks. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Investment Portfolio Risk All of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale and are therefore recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets with the unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income or loss. We consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge for our securities, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. As more fully described in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, during the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $2.6 million from our investment portfolio (consisting of a single money market account that incurred additional other-than-temporary impairment losses totaling $1.5 million in 2008), of which $3.6 million was recovered during the year ended December 31, 2010. If market conditions continue to deteriorate and liquidity constraints become even more pronounced, we could sustain more losses from our 67 Table of Contents investment portfolio. As our securities mature, we have been increasing our holdings in U.S. government securities, such as Treasury bills and Treasury notes of a short-term duration and lower yield. As a result, we expect our interest income to remain low in the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2011, our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market fund investments, corporate bonds, asset backed securities and U.S government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, commercial papers and certificates of deposit. Excluding the U.S. government holdings which carry a lower risk and lower return in comparison to other securities in the portfolio, the remaining amount in our investment portfolio that could be more susceptible to market risk totaled $299.7 million. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and a variable-rate financing in the Asia-Pacific region. The fair value of our marketable securities could be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, but we do not believe such impact would be material. Securities with longer maturities are subject to a greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities and as of December 31, 2011 the average duration of our portfolio was less than three months. If current interest rates were to increase or decrease by 10% from their position as of December 31, 2011, the fair value of our investment portfolio could increase or decrease by approximately $834,000. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates from their position as of December 31, 2011 would not have a material impact on our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of the majority of our debt obligations. However, the interest expense associated with our Asia-Pacific financing, which bears interest at variable rates tied to local cost of funds, could be affected. For every 100 basis point change in interest rates, our annual interest expense could increase or decrease by a total of approximately $3.7 million based on the total balance of our borrowings under the Asia-Pacific financing as of December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, we had no outstanding interest rate swaps. The fair value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate changes may affect the fair value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair value of our convertible debt, which is traded in the market, is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of our loans payable, which are not traded in the market, is estimated by considering our credit rating, current rates available to us for debt of the same remaining maturities and the terms of the debt. The following represents the estimated fair value of our loans payable, senior notes and convertible debt and as of (in thousands): December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 CarryingValue Fair Value CarryingValue Fair Value Loans payable $ 256,235 $ 269,451 $ 120,315 $ 126,958 Senior Notes 1,500,000 1,612,287 750,000 816,270 Convertible debt 941,084 1,057,801 916,337 995,012 We may enter into interest rate hedging agreements in the future to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk. 68 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Risk The majority of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, generated mostly from customers in the U.S. However, approximately 40% of both our revenues and operating costs are attributable to Brazil, Canada and the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions and a large portion of those revenues and costs are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Brazilian Reais, Canadian dollar, British pound, Euro, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar. As a result, our operating results and cash flows are impacted by currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. To protect against certain reductions in value caused by changes in currency exchange rates, we have established a risk management program to offset some of the risk of carrying assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Our risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements and its impact on the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2011, the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of less than one year. For the foreseeable future, we anticipate that approximately 35-45% of our revenues and operating costs will continue to be generated and incurred outside of the U.S. in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. While we hedge certain of our balance sheet foreign currency assets and liabilities, we do not hedge revenue. During fiscal 2011, the U.S. dollar was generally weak relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate. This overall weakness of the U.S. dollar had a positive impact on our consolidated results of operations because the foreign denominations translated into more U.S. dollars; however, the U.S. dollar began to strengthen towards the end of 2011, which is expected to have a negative impact on our results of operations as we enter 2012. In future periods, the volatility of the U.S. dollar as compared to the other currencies in which we do business could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations including the amount of revenue that we report in future periods. We may enter into additional hedging activities in the future to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency risk as our exposure to foreign currency risk continues to increase due to our growing foreign operations; however, we do not currently intend to eliminate all foreign currency transaction exposure. Commodity Price Risk Certain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of price changes are electricity, supplies and equipment used in our IBX data centers. We closely monitor the cost of electricity at all of our locations. We have entered into several power contracts to purchase power at fixed prices during 2012 and beyond in certain locations in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom. In addition, as we are building new, or expanding existing, IBX data centers, we are subject to commodity price risk for building materials related to the construction of these IBX data centers, such as steel and copper. In addition, the lead-time to procure certain pieces of equipment, such as generators, is substantial. Any delays in procuring the necessary pieces of equipment for the construction of our IBX data centers could delay the anticipated openings of these new IBX data centers and, as a result, increase the cost of these projects. We do not currently employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to address commodity price risk other than the power contracts discussed above.",2023-12-30 20:28:15.035412

Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. For example, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist readers in understanding our financial information from our management’s perspective and is presented as follows: • Overview • Results of Operations • Non-GAAP Financial Measures • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements • Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates • Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2012, as more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we entered into an alliance agreement with Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company PJSC, commercially branded and referred to as du, to deliver colocation and interconnection offerings to customers in the Middle East. We entered into an asset sale and purchase agreement with E-Hosting DataFort FZ, LLC, referred to as EHDF, for a substantially completed data center located in Dubai for cash consideration of approximately $22.9 million. We also entered a lease agreement with Tecom Investment FZ, LLC, referred to as Tecom, for the underlying building space where the data center assets that were acquired by the Company from EHDF are located. Our IBX data center in Dubai opened for business in early 2013. We refer to this series of transactions collectively as the Dubai IBX data center acquisition. In November 2012, as more fully described in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we sold 16 of our IBX data centers located throughout the U.S. for net proceeds of approximately $76.5 million, which resulted in an after-tax gain on disposal of discontinued operations of approximately $11.9 million. We refer to this transaction as the divestiture. In September 2012, we announced that our board of directors approved a plan to pursue conversion to a real estate investment trust, which is referred to as a REIT. We refer to this conversion plan as the REIT conversion. If we are ultimately successful in converting to a REIT, we expect to elect REIT status for our taxable year beginning January 1, 2015. Please see “Potential REIT Conversion” in the below “Overview.” In July 2012, as more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we acquired certain assets and operations of Asia Tone Limited, referred to as 38 Table of Contents Asia Tone, a privately-owned company headquartered in Hong Kong, for gross cash consideration of approximately $230.5 million. We refer to this transaction as the Asia Tone acquisition. We agreed to pay net cash consideration of $202.4 million as a result of adjustments to the purchase price included in the purchase and sale agreement. Asia Tone operates six data centers and one disaster recovery center across locations in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore. The Asia Tone acquisition included one data center under construction in Shanghai. The combined company operates under the Equinix name. In July 2012, as more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding share capital of ancotel GmbH, referred to as ancotel, a privately-owned company headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany for cash consideration of approximately $85.7 million. We refer to this transaction as the ancotel acquisition. ancotel operates one data center in Frankfurt and edge nodes in Hong Kong and London. The combined company operates under the Equinix name. In June 2012, as more fully described in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we entered into a credit agreement with a group of lenders for a $750.0 million credit facility, comprised of a $200.0 million term loan facility, referred to as the U.S. term loan, and a $550.0 million multicurrency revolving credit facility, referred to as the U.S. revolving credit line. We refer to this transaction as the U.S. financing. In July 2012, we fully utilized the U.S. term loan and used the funds to prepay and terminate the Asia-Pacific financing. Overview Equinix provides global data center services that protect and connect the world’s most valued information assets. Global enterprises, financial services companies, and content and network service providers rely upon Equinix’s leading insight and data centers in 31 markets around the world for the safehousing of their critical IT equipment and the ability to directly connect to the networks that enable today’s information-driven economy. Equinix offers the following solutions: (i) premium data center colocation, (ii) interconnection and (iii) exchange and outsourced IT infrastructure services. As of December 31, 2012, we operated or had partner IBX data centers in the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Rio De Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Seattle, Silicon Valley, Toronto and Washington, D.C. metro areas in the Americas region; France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom in the EMEA region; and Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, China and Singapore in the Asia-Pacific region. We leverage our global data centers in 31 markets around the world as a global platform which houses more than 90% of the world’s Internet routes and allows our customers to increase information and application delivery performance while significantly reducing costs. Based on our global platform and the quality of our IBX data centers, we believe we have established a critical mass of customers. As more customers locate in our IBX data centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate as well in order to gain the full economic and performance benefits of our offerings. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a “marketplace” for their services. Our global platform enables scalable, reliable and cost-effective colocation, interconnection and traffic exchange thus lowering overall cost and increasing flexibility. Our focused business model is based on our critical mass of customers and the resulting “marketplace” effect. This global platform, combined with our strong financial position, continues to drive new customer growth and bookings as we drive scale into our global business. Historically, our market has been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled their telecommunications products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include cloud computing/utility providers, application hosting providers and systems integrators, managed infrastructure hosting providers and colocation providers with over 350 companies providing data center solutions in the U.S. alone. Each of these data center solutions providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings, and outsourced IT infrastructure services. We are able to offer our 39 Table of Contents customers a global platform that supports global reach to 15 countries, proven operational reliability, improved application performance and network choice, and a highly scalable set of offerings. Excluding Asia Tone and ancotel, our customer count increased to approximately 6,093 as of December 31, 2012 versus approximately 5,538 as of December 31, 2011, an increase of 9%. This increase was due to organic growth in our business. Our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus net sellable cabinet space available, taking into account power limitations. Excluding Asia Tone and ancotel, our utilization rate decreased to approximately 76% as of December 31, 2012 versus approximately 80% as of December 31, 2011; however, excluding the impact of our IBX data center expansion projects that have opened during the last 12 months, our utilization rate would have increased to approximately 84% as of December 31, 2012. Our utilization rate varies from market to market among our IBX data centers across the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain of our high power demand customers. This increased power consumption has driven the requirement to build out our new IBX data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX data centers. We could face power limitations in our centers even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific IBX data center. This could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows. Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and offerings. As was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors such as demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to break-even on a free cash flow basis and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. Depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to Equinix standards. Property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant. Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related interconnection and managed infrastructure offerings. We consider these offerings recurring because our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. In addition, during the past three years, in any given quarter, greater than half of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer’s initial deployment and professional services that we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring because they are billed typically once and upon completion of the installation or professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. However, revenues from installation services are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the term of the related contract or expected life of the services. Additionally, revenue from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is recognized when no remaining performance obligations exist and collectability is reasonably assured, to the extent that the revenue has not previously been recognized. As a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future. 40 Table of Contents Our Americas revenues are derived primarily from colocation and related interconnection offerings, and our EMEA and Asia-Pacific revenues are derived primarily from colocation and managed infrastructure services. The largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX data centers, utility costs, including electricity and bandwidth, IBX data center employees’ salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment and security services. A substantial majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing IBX data centers or open or acquire new IBX data centers. However, there are certain costs which are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies, that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. We expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will generally increase in the future on a per-unit or fixed basis in addition to the variable increase related to the growth in consumption by the customer. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months as compared to other times of the year. To the extent we incur increased utility costs, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, to the extent we incur increased electricity costs as a result of either climate change policies or the physical effects of climate change, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer contract intangible assets. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees, and other general corporate expenses such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and some depreciation expense. Due to our recurring revenue model, and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature and generally does not grow in proportion to revenue growth, we expect our cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses to decline as a percentage of revenue over time, although we expect each of them to grow in absolute dollars in connection with our growth. This is evident in the trends noted below in our discussion about our results of operations. However, for cost of revenues, this trend may periodically be impacted when a large expansion project opens or is acquired and before it starts generating any meaningful revenue. Furthermore, in relation to cost of revenues, we note that the Americas region has a lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue than either EMEA or Asia-Pacific. This is due to both the increased scale and maturity of the Americas region compared to either the EMEA or Asia-Pacific region, as well as a higher cost structure outside of the Americas, particularly in EMEA. While we expect all three regions to continue to see lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in future periods, we expect the trend of the Americas having the lowest cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue and EMEA having the highest to continue. As a result, to the extent that revenue growth outside the Americas grows in greater proportion than revenue growth in the Americas, our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may increase in future periods. Sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses may also periodically increase as a percentage of revenue as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth. Potential REIT Conversion On September 13, 2012, we announced that our board of directors approved a plan for Equinix to pursue conversion to a REIT. We have begun implementation of the REIT conversion, and we plan to make a tax election for REIT status for the taxable year beginning January 1, 2015. Any REIT election made by us must be effective as of the beginning of a taxable year; therefore, as a calendar year taxpayer, if we are unable to convert to a REIT by January 1, 2015, the next possible conversion date would be January 1, 2016. 41 Table of Contents If we are able to convert to and qualify as a REIT, we will generally be permitted to deduct from federal income taxes the dividends we pay to our stockholders. The income represented by such dividends would not be subject to federal taxation at the entity level but would be taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. Nevertheless, the income of our domestic TRS, which will hold our U.S. operations that may not be REIT-compliant, will be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income tax. Likewise, our foreign subsidiaries will continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through TRS or through QRS. We will also be subject to a separate corporate income tax on any gains recognized during a specified period (generally 10 years) following the REIT conversion that are attributable to “built-in” gains with respect to the assets that we own on the date we convert to a REIT. Our ability to qualify as a REIT will depend upon our continuing compliance following our REIT conversion with various requirements, including requirements related to the nature of our assets, the sources of our income and the distributions to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the federal income tax regime for REITs described above, many states do not completely follow federal rules and some may not follow them at all. The REIT conversion implementation currently includes seeking a PLR from the IRS. Our PLR request has multiple components, and the conversion to a REIT will require favorable rulings from the IRS on numerous technical tax issues, including classification of our data center assets as qualified real estate assets. We submitted the PLR request to the IRS in 2012, but the IRS may not provide a PLR until late in 2013 or at all. We currently estimate that we will incur approximately $50.0 to $80.0 million in costs to support the REIT conversion, in addition to related tax liabilities associated with a change in our method of depreciating and amortizing various data center assets for tax purposes from our current method to methods that are more consistent with the characterization of such assets as real property for REIT purposes. The total recapture of depreciation and amortization expenses across all relevant assets is expected to result in federal and state tax liability of approximately $340.0 to $420.0 million, which amount will be payable in the four-year period starting in 2012 even if we abandon the REIT conversion for any reason, including the failure to receive the PLR we are seeking. Prior to the decision to convert to a REIT, our balance sheet reflected our income tax liability as a non-current deferred tax liability. As a result of the decision to convert to a REIT, our non-current tax liability will be gradually and proportionally reclassified from non-current to current over the four-year period, which started in the third quarter of 2012. The current liability reflects the tax liability that relates to additional taxable income expected to be recognized within the twelve-month period from the date of the balance sheet. If the REIT conversion is successful, we also expect to incur an additional $5.0 to $10.0 million in annual compliance costs in future years. We expect to pay between $175.0 to $250.0 million in cash taxes during 2013. Results of Operations Our results of operations for year ended December 31, 2012 include the operations of the Dubai IBX data center acquisition from November 9, 2012, Asia Tone from July 4, 2012 and ancotel from July 3, 2012. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 include the operations of ALOG from April 25, 2011. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 include the operations of Switch & Data Facilities Company, Inc., which is referred to as Switch and Data, from May 1, 2010. Discontinued Operations We present the results of operations associated with 16 of our IBX centers that we sold as net income from discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations. Our results of operations have been reclassified to reflect our discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise stated, the results of operations discussed herein refer to our continuing operations. 42 Table of Contents Constant Currency Presentation Our revenues and certain operating expenses (cost of revenues, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses) from our international operations have represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues and certain operating expenses. As a result, our revenues and certain operating expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. dollar against major international currencies such as the Brazilian reais, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Chinese Yuan, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar. In order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present period-over-period percentage changes in our revenues and certain operating expenses on a constant currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, we have presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results. To present this information, our current and comparative prior period revenues and certain operating expenses from entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2011 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2012 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2012 with the year ended December 31, 2011, and average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2010 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2011 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2011 with the year ended December 31, 2010). Years Ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2012 % 2011 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas: Recurring revenues $ 1,114,579 59 % $ 959,907 61 % 16 % 16 % Non-recurring revenues 45,895 2 % 35,808 2 % 28 % 30 % 1,160,474 61 % 995,715 63 % 17 % 17 % EMEA: Recurring revenues 400,002 21 % 328,355 21 % 22 % 28 % Non-recurring revenues 33,448 2 % 29,867 2 % 12 % 19 % 433,450 23 % 358,222 23 % 21 % 27 % Asia-Pacific: Recurring revenues 284,662 15 % 204,152 13 % 39 % 39 % Non-recurring revenues 17,158 1 % 11,695 1 % 47 % 46 % 301,820 16 % 215,847 14 % 40 % 39 % Total: Recurring revenues 1,799,243 95 % 1,492,414 95 % 21 % 22 % Non-recurring revenues 96,501 5 % 77,370 5 % 25 % 28 % $ 1,895,744 100 % $ 1,569,784 100 % 21 % 22 % Americas Revenues. Growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to (i) $27.2 million of incremental revenue from ALOG ($74.1 million of full-year revenue contributions from ALOG during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $46.9 million of partial-year revenue contributions during the year ended December 31, 2011), (ii) $26.5 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers and IBX 43 Table of Contents data center expansions in the Dallas, Miami, New York and Washington, D.C. metro areas and (iii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above. We expect that our Americas revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth through recently-opened IBX data center expansions and additional IBX data center expansions currently taking place in the Chicago, Seattle, Toronto and Washington, D.C. metro areas, which are expected to open during 2013 and 2014. Our estimates of future revenue growth take account of expected changes in recurring revenues attributable to customer bookings, customer churn or changes or amendments to customers’ contracts. EMEA Revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, our revenues from the United Kingdom, the largest revenue contributor in the EMEA region for the period, represented approximately 38% and 36%, respectively, of the regional revenues. Our EMEA revenue growth was due to (i) $11.5 million of additional revenue resulting from the ancotel acquisition, (ii) $31.8 million of revenue from our recently-opened IBX data center expansions in the Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris metro areas and (iii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss Franc than during the year ended December 31, 2011, resulting in approximately $22.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA revenues during the year ended December 31, 2012 on a constant currency basis. We expect that our EMEA revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of the ancotel acquisition and our continued growth through recently-opened IBX data center expansions and additional IBX data center expansions currently taking place in the Dubai, Frankfurt and Zurich metro areas, which are expected to open during 2013. Our estimates of future revenue growth take into account expected changes in recurring revenues attributable to customer bookings, customer churn or changes or amendments to customers’ contracts. Asia-Pacific Revenues. Our revenues from Singapore, the largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, represented approximately 37% and 40%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. Our Asia-Pacific revenue growth was due to (i) $23.1 million of additional revenue resulting from the Asia Tone acquisition, (ii) $9.5 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX center expansions in the Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore and Sydney metro areas and (iii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific revenues was not significant on a constant currency basis. We expect that our Asia-Pacific revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of the Asia Tone acquisition and our continued growth through recently-opened IBX data center expansions and additional IBX data center expansions currently taking place in the Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo metro areas, which are expected to open during 2013. Our estimates of future revenue growth take into account expected changes in recurring revenues attributable to customer bookings, or changes or amendments to customers’ contracts. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2012 % 2011 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas. $ 532,691 57 % $ 491,460 59 % 8 % 8 % EMEA 230,239 24 % 212,967 26 % 8 % 15 % Asia-Pacific 181,065 19 % 129,424 15 % 40 % 40 % Total $ 943,995 100 % $ 833,851 100 % 13 % 15 % 44 Table of Contents Years endedDecember 31, 2012 2011 Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues: Americas . 46 % 49 % EMEA 53 % 59 % Asia-Pacific 60 % 60 % Total 50 % 53 % Americas Cost of Revenues. Our Americas cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 included $196.1 million and $178.6 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to both our organic IBX data center expansion activity and acquisitions. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in our Americas cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $9.4 million of incremental Americas cost of revenues resulting from the ALOG acquisition, (ii) $7.0 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation cost and (iii) $5.9 million of higher costs associated with certain revenues from offerings provided to customers. We expect Americas cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business. EMEA Cost of Revenues. EMEA cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 included $69.4 million and $67.0 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to both our organic IBX data center expansion activity and acquisitions. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $4.4 million of additional cost of revenues resulting from the ancotel acquisition, (ii) an increase of $6.5 million in utility costs arising from increased customer installations and revenues attributed to customer growth and (iii) $3.2 million of higher costs associated with costs of equipment sales. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss franc than during the year ended December 31, 2011, resulting in approximately $13.7 million of favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA cost of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2012 on a constant currency basis. We expect EMEA cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business including costs related to the Dubai IBX data center acquisition. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 included $71.8 million and $46.7 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to both our organic IBX data center expansion activity and the Asia Tone acquisition. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $10.1 million of additional cost of revenues resulting from the Asia Tone acquisition, (ii) $10.7 million in higher utility costs and (iii) $2.9 million of higher compensation expense, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (192 Asia-Pacific employees as of December 31, 2012 versus 153 as of December 31, 2011). For the year ended December 31, 2012, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was not significant on a constant currency basis. We expect Asia-Pacific cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business. Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2012 % 2011 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas. $ 122,970 61 % $ 103,435 65 % 19 % 19 % EMEA 52,595 26 % 36,528 23 % 44 % 49 % Asia-Pacific 27,349 13 % 18,384 12 % 49 % 48 % Total $ 202,914 100 % $ 158,347 100 % 28 % 29 % 45 Table of Contents Years endedDecember 31, 2012 2011 Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues: Americas 11 % 10 % EMEA 12 % 10 % Asia-Pacific 9 % 9 % Total 11 % 10 % Americas Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our Americas sales and marketing expenses was due to (i) $3.8 million of incremental sales and marketing expenses resulting from the ALOG acquisition, (ii) $11.4 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (256 Americas sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2012 versus 241 as of December 31, 2011) and (iii) $3.4 million of professional fees to support our growth. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our Americas sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts and, as a result, our Americas sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues have increased. Although we anticipate that we will continue to invest in Americas sales and marketing initiatives, we believe our Americas sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues will remain at approximately current levels over the next year but should ultimately decrease as we continue to grow our business. EMEA Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our EMEA sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to (i) $4.6 million of additional sales and marketing expenses resulting from the ancotel acquisition and (ii) $7.7 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense and headcount growth (148 EMEA sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2012 versus 117 as of December 31, 2011). For the year ended December 31, 2012, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our EMEA sales and marketing expenses was not significant on a constant currency basis. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our EMEA sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts and, as a result, our EMEA sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues have increased. Although we anticipate that we will continue to invest in EMEA sales and marketing initiatives, we believe our EMEA sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues will remain at approximately current levels over the next year or two but should ultimately decrease as we continue to grow our business. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to (i) $1.9 million of additional sales and marketing expenses resulting from the Asia Tone acquisition and (ii) $6.3 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (95 Asia-Pacific sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2012 versus 70 as of December 31, 2011). For the year ended December 31, 2012, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was not significant on a constant currency basis. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts and, as a result, our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses have increased. Although we anticipate that we will continue to invest in Asia-Pacific sales and marketing initiatives, we believe our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues will remain at approximately current levels over the next year or two but should ultimately decrease as we continue to grow our business. 46 Table of Contents General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2012 % 2011 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas $ 239,311 73 % $ 191,439 72 % 25 % 25 % EMEA 57,093 17 % 48,936 18 % 17 % 20 % Asia-Pacific 32,995 10 % 25,179 10 % 31 % 30 % Total $ 329,399 100 % $ 265,554 100 % 24 % 25 % Years endedDecember 31, 2012 2011 General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues: Americas . 21 % 19 % EMEA 13 % 14 % Asia-Pacific 11 % 12 % Total 17 % 17 % Americas General and Administrative Expenses. Our Americas general and administrative expenses, which include general corporate expenses, included $1.6 million of additional general and administrative expenses resulting from the ALOG acquisition. Excluding the ALOG acquisition, the increase in our Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $22.4 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (605 Americas general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2012 versus 577 as of December 31, 2011), (ii) $15.4 million of higher professional fees to support our growth and our REIT conversion process and (iii) $4.8 million of higher depreciation expense as a result of our ongoing efforts to support our growth, such as investments in systems. Over the course of the past year, we have been investing in our Americas general and administrative functions to scale this region effectively for growth, which has included additional investments into improving our back office systems. We expect our current efforts to improve our back office systems will continue over the next several years. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending given the current economic environment, we expect Americas general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to further scale our operations to support our growth, including this investment in our back office systems and the REIT conversion process. EMEA General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our EMEA general and administrative expenses was primarily due to $3.2 million of additional general and administrative expenses resulting from the ancotel acquisition and (ii) $5.9 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (196 EMEA general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2012 versus 180 as of December 31, 2011), partially offset by $3.7 million of lower professional fees. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our EMEA general and administrative expenses was not significant on a constant currency basis. Over the course of the past year, we have been investing in our EMEA general and administrative functions as a result of our ongoing efforts to scale this region effectively for growth. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending given the current economic environment, we expect our EMEA general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth; however, as a percentage of revenues, we generally expect them to decrease. Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was primarily due to $5.4 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (166 Asia-Pacific general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2012 versus 153 as of December 31, 2011). For the year ended December 31, 2012, the impact of 47 Table of Contents foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was not significant on a constant currency basis. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending given the current economic environment, we expect Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth; however, as a percentage of revenues, we generally expect them to decrease. Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we did not record any restructuring charges. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $3.5 million primarily related to revised sublease assumptions on our excess leased space in the New York metro area. Our excess leased space in the New York metro area remains abandoned and continues to carry a restructuring charge. For additional information, see “Restructuring Charges” in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Impairment Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded impairment charges totaling $9.9 million as a result of the fair values of certain long-lived assets being lower than their carrying values due to our decision to abandon two properties in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions. For additional information, see “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the year ended December 31, 2011, no impairment charges were recorded. Acquisition Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $8.8 million primarily attributed to the ancotel and Asia Tone acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $3.3 million primarily related to the ALOG acquisition. Interest Income. Interest income increased to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 from $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Interest income increased primarily due to higher yields on invested balances. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2012 was 0.43% versus 0.33% for the year ended December 31, 2011. We expect our interest income to remain at these low levels for the foreseeable future due to the impact of a continued low interest rate environment and a portfolio more weighted towards short-term securities. Interest Expense. During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, we recorded interest expense of $200.3 million and $181.3 million, respectively. This increase was primarily due to the impact of our $750.0 million 7.00% senior notes offering in July 2011, which resulted in an approximately $28.6 million increase in interest expense, and additional financings such as various capital lease and other financing obligations to support our expansion projects. This increase was partially offset by our settlement of the $250.0 million 2.50% convertible subordinated notes in April 2012, which resulted in an approximately $13.7 million decrease in interest expense. During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, we capitalized $30.6 million and $13.6 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. Going forward, we expect our interest expense to increase by approximately $5.0 million annually as a result of our drawdown of the ALOG financing in July 2012. However, we may begin taking drawdowns from the U.S. revolving credit line under the U.S. financing or incur additional indebtedness to support our growth, resulting in further increases to our interest expense. Other Income (Expense). For the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded $2.2 million of other expense compared to $2.8 million of other income for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains (losses) during the periods. Loss on debt extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded $5.2 million of loss on debt extinguishment due to the repayment and termination of the Asia-Pacific financing. During the year ended December 31, 2011, no loss on debt extinguishment was recorded. Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded $61.8 million of income tax expense. The income tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily a result of 48 Table of Contents applying the effective statutory tax rates to our operating income adjusted for permanent tax adjustments for the period and the assessments of valuation allowances of $5.4 million against the net deferred tax assets with certain foreign operating entities. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded $37.5 million of income tax expense. The income tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily a result of applying the effective statutory tax rates to our operating income adjusted for permanent tax adjustments for the period, partially offset by an income tax benefit due to the release of a valuation allowance of $2.5 million associated with certain foreign operating entities. The cash taxes for 2012 and 2011 were primarily for state and foreign income taxes. In connection with the planned REIT Conversion, we changed our method of depreciating and amortizing various data center assets for tax purposes to methods more consistent with the characterization of such assets as real property for REIT purposes. As a result of this decision, we reclassified $89.2 million of non-current deferred tax liabilities to current deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2012 associated with taxes that are expected to be paid in the next 12 months. The change in depreciation and amortization method also increased our taxable income for 2012, resulting in an acceleration of the usage of our operating and windfall employee equity award net operating loss carryforwards. As a result of the tax depreciation method change, the taxable gain recognized in the divestiture and the level of operating profits, we utilized most of our net operating losses in the U.S. for which a deferred tax asset had been previously recognized and most of our windfall tax losses in the U.S. for which a deferred tax asset had not been previously recognized. We recorded excess income tax benefits of $84.7 million from stock-based compensation in our consolidated balance sheets. Commencing with certain reorganization activities that we started during the fourth quarter of 2012, we will reassess the long-term profitability of certain of our operations that are currently incurring losses in EMEA. The reassessment may result in releases of valuation allowances that are currently assessed against the net deferred tax assets with these operations, which will affect our effective tax rate favorably at the time when such a benefit is recognized. Net Income from Discontinued Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2012, our net income from discontinued operations was $13.1 million, consisting of $11.9 million from the gain on sale of discontinued operations, net of income tax, and $1.2 million of net income from discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our net income from discontinued operations was $1.0 million.

Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2011 % 2010 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas: Recurring revenues $ 959,907 61 % $ 725,015 61 % 32 % 32 % Non-recurring revenues 35,808 2 % 27,040 2 % 32 % 32 % 995,715 63 % 752,055 63 % 32 % 32 % EMEA: Recurring revenues 328,355 21 % 256,570 22 % 28 % 22 % Non-recurring revenues 29,867 2 % 25,223 2 % 18 % 13 % 358,222 23 % 281,793 24 % 27 % 21 % Asia-Pacific: Recurring revenues 204,152 13 % 155,200 13 % 32 % 24 % Non-recurring revenues 11,695 1 % 7,166 0 % 63 % 54 % 215,847 14 % 162,366 13 % 33 % 25 % Total: Recurring revenues 1,492,414 95 % 1,136,785 96 % 31 % 29 % Non-recurring revenues 77,370 5 % 59,429 4 % 30 % 27 % $ 1,569,784 100 % $ 1,196,214 100 % 31 % 29 % Americas Revenues. Growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to (i) additional revenues resulting from acquisitions, including $85.1 million of incremental revenue from Switch and Data ($214.0 million of full-year revenue contributions from Switch and Data during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $128.8 million of partial-year revenue contributions during the year ended December 31, 2010) and $46.9 million of additional revenue resulting from the ALOG acquisition, (ii) $8.9 million of revenues generated from the IBX data centers we opened during the period and the IBX data centers we expanded during the period in the Chicago and Dallas metro areas and (iii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above. The following table presents our Americas revenues excluding the impact of acquisitions (dollars in thousands): Years endedDecember 31, Change 2011 2010 $ % Americas: Recurring revenues $ 706,462 $ 598,860 $ 107,602 18 % Non-recurring revenues 28,430 24,355 4,075 17 % $ 734,892 $ 623,215 $ 111,677 18 % EMEA Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2011, our revenues from the United Kingdom, the largest revenue contributor in the EMEA region for the period, represented approximately 36% of the regional revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2010, our revenues from Germany, the largest revenue contributor in the EMEA region for the period, represented approximately 36% of the regional revenues. Our EMEA revenue growth was due to (i) $30.0 million of revenue from our recently-opened IBX data center 50 Table of Contents expansions in the Amsterdam, London and Paris metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss Franc than during the year ended December 31, 2010, resulting in approximately $17.3 million of favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA revenues during the year ended December 31, 2011 on a constant currency basis. Asia-Pacific Revenues. Our revenues from Singapore, the largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, represented approximately 40% and 38%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Our Asia-Pacific revenue growth was due to an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded approximately $13.0 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX center expansions in the Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo metro areas. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Australian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar than during the year ended December 31, 2010, resulting in approximately $16.2 million of favorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific revenues during the year ended December 31, 2011 on a constant currency basis. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2011 % 2010 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas. $ 491,460 59 % $ 386,258 59 % 27 % 27 % EMEA 212,967 26 % 176,937 27 % 20 % 13 % Asia-Pacific 129,424 15 % 88,961 14 % 45 % 35 % Total $ 833,851 100 % $ 652,156 100 % 28 % 24 % Years endedDecember 31, 2011 2010 Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues: Americas . 49 % 51 % EMEA 59 % 63 % Asia-Pacific 60 % 55 % Total 53 % 55 % Americas Cost of Revenues. Our Americas cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 included $178.6 million and $140.8 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to both our organic IBX data center expansion activity and acquisitions. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in our Americas cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) additional Americas cost of revenues resulting from the impact of acquisitions, such as $35.5 million of incremental cost of revenues from Switch and Data and $25.2 million of additional cost of revenues resulting from the ALOG acquisition, and (ii) an increase of $5.4 million in utility costs as a result of increased customer installations. EMEA Cost of Revenues. EMEA cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 included $67.0 million and $53.7 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX center expansion activity. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in EMEA cost of revenues was primarily the result of costs associated with our expansion projects and overall growth in costs to support our revenue growth, such as (i) an increase of $8.8 million in utility costs arising from increased customer installations and revenues attributed to customer growth, (ii) $3.6 million of higher compensation 51 Table of Contents expense, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (273 EMEA employees as of December 31, 2011 versus 231 as of December 31, 2010), (iii) $3.1 million increase in property taxes and rent and facility costs , (iv) $2.4 million of higher third-party services such as security and various consulting services and (v) $2.2 million of higher repair and maintenance costs. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss franc than during the year ended December 31, 2010, resulting in approximately $11.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA cost of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2011 on a constant currency basis. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 included $46.7 million and $28.1 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX center expansion activity. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily the result of costs associated with our expansion projects and overall growth in costs to support our revenue growth, such as (i) $8.7 million in higher utility costs, (ii) an increase of $5.2 million of rent and facility costs, (iii) $2.7 million of higher compensation expense, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (153 Asia-Pacific employees as of December 31, 2011 versus 104 as of December 31, 2010) and (iv) $2.3 million of higher costs related to customer installations. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Australian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar than during the year ended December 31, 2010, resulting in approximately $9.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2011 on a constant currency basis. Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2011 % 2010 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas $ 103,435 65 % $ 72,605 65 % 42 % 42 % EMEA 36,528 23 % 24,071 22 % 52 % 45 % Asia-Pacific 18,384 12 % 14,089 13 % 30 % 24 % Total $ 158,347 100 % $ 110,765 100 % 43 % 41 % Years endedDecember 31, 2011 2010 Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues: Americas 10 % 10 % EMEA 10 % 9 % Asia-Pacific 9 % 9 % Total 10 % 9 % Americas Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our Americas sales and marketing expenses included $6.4 million of additional sales and marketing expenses from the ALOG acquisition. Excluding the impact of the ALOG acquisition, the increase in our Americas sales and marketing expenses was due to (i) $17.2 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (241 Americas sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2011 versus 190 as of December 31, 2010), (ii) $2.9 million of higher bad debt expense, which is partially due to the revenue growth as discussed above and (iii) $2.4 million of higher recruiting costs and advertising and promotion costs. EMEA Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our EMEA sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $8.2 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and headcount growth (117 EMEA sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2011 versus 87 as of December 31, 2010). During the year ended December 31, 2011, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss Franc than during the year ended 52 Table of Contents December 31, 2010, resulting in approximately $1.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA sales and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2011 on a constant currency basis. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $2.7 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (70 Asia-Pacific sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2011 versus 51 as of December 31, 2010). For the year ended December 31, 2011, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was not significant on a constant currency basis. General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2011 % 2010 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas $ 191,439 72 % $ 155,353 71 % 23 % 23 % EMEA 48,936 18 % 44,791 20 % 9 % 4 % Asia-Pacific 25,179 10 % 20,474 9 % 23 % 15 % Total $ 265,554 100 % $ 220,618 100 % 20 % 19 % Years endedDecember 31, 2011 2010 General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues: Americas 19 % 21 % EMEA 14 % 16 % Asia-Pacific 12 % 13 % Total 17 % 18 % Americas General and Administrative Expenses. Our Americas general and administrative expenses, which include general corporate expenses, included $6.0 million of additional general and administrative expenses resulting from the ALOG acquisition. Excluding the ALOG acquisition, the increase in our Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $17.0 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (577 Americas general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2011 versus 487 as of December 31, 2010), (ii) $6.2 million of higher depreciation expense as a result of our ongoing efforts to support our growth, such as investments in systems and (iii) $3.9 million of higher professional fees to support our growth. EMEA General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our EMEA general and administrative expenses was primarily due to $3.5 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (180 EMEA general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2011 versus 167 as of December 31, 2010). During the year ended December 31, 2011, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss Franc than during the year ended December 31, 2010, resulting in approximately $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2011 on a constant currency basis. Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was primarily due to $3.1 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (153 Asia-Pacific general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2011 versus 128 as of December 31, 2010). During the year ended December 31, 2011, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Australian dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar than during the year ended December 31, 2010, resulting in approximately $1.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2011 on a constant currency basis. 53 Table of Contents Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $3.5 million primarily related to revised sublease assumptions on our excess leased space in the New York metro area. Our excess space lease in the New York metro area remains abandoned and continues to carry a restructuring charge. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $6.7 million comprised of $5.3 million related to one-time termination benefits attributed to certain Switch and Data employees and $1.4 million related to revised sublease assumptions on our excess leased space in the New York metro area. For additional information, see “Restructuring Charges” in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Acquisition Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $3.3 million primarily related to the ALOG acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $12.3 million primarily related to the Switch and Data acquisition. Interest Income. Interest income increased to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Interest income increased primarily due to higher yields on invested balances. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2011 was 0.33% versus 0.18% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $181.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $140.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase in interest expense was primarily due to the impact of our $750.0 million 7.00% senior notes offering, additional financings such as capital lease and other financing obligations to support our expansion projects and additional advances from our Asia-Pacific financing. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we capitalized $13.6 million and $10.3 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Recovery (Loss) On Investments. During the year ended December 31, 2011, no other-than-temporary impairment recovery (loss) on investments was recorded. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a $3.6 million other-than-temporary impairment recovery on investments due to additional distributions from one of our money market accounts as more fully described in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other Income (Expense). For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we recorded $2.8 million and $692,000 of other income, respectively, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains during the periods. Loss on debt extinguishment and interest rate swaps, net. During the year ended December 31, 2011, no loss on debt extinguishment and interest rate swaps, net, was recorded. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded a $10.2 million loss on debt extinguishment and interest rate swaps, net. For additional information, see “Loss on Debt Extinguishment and Interest Rate Swaps, Net” in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded $37.5 million of income tax expense. The income tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily a result of applying the effective statutory tax rates to our operating income adjusted for permanent tax adjustments for the period, partially offset by an income tax benefit due to the release of a valuation allowance of $2.5 million associated with our certain foreign operating entities. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded $12.6 million of income tax expense. The income tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily a result of applying the effective statutory tax rates to our operating income adjusted for permanent tax adjustments for the period, partially offset by income tax benefits due to the release of valuation allowances of $7.3 million associated with certain of our foreign operating entities. Net Income from Discontinued Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, our net income from discontinued operations was $1.0 million and $668,000, respectively. For additional information, 54 Table of Contents see “Discontinued Operations” in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We provide all information required in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but we believe that evaluating our ongoing operating results from continuing operations may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, we use non-GAAP financial measures, primarily adjusted EBITDA, to evaluate our continuing operations. We also use adjusted EBITDA as a metric in the determination of employees’ annual bonuses and vesting of restricted stock units that have both a service and performance condition. In presenting adjusted EBITDA, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future operating performance. These items are depreciation, amortization, accretion of asset retirement obligations and accrued restructuring charges, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges and acquisition costs. Legislative and regulatory requirements encourage the use of and emphasis on GAAP financial metrics and require companies to explain why non-GAAP financial metrics are relevant to management and investors. We exclude these items in order for our lenders, investors, and industry analysts, who review and report on us, to better evaluate our operating performance and cash spending levels relative to our industry sector and competitors. For example, we exclude depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of our IBX data centers and do not reflect our current or future cash spending levels to support our business. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of our IBX data centers do not recur and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to our initial investment. This is a trend we expect to continue. In addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of our IBX data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs incurred to build out our IBX data centers, and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. Therefore, we exclude depreciation from our operating results when evaluating our continuing operations. In addition, in presenting the non-GAAP financial measures, we exclude amortization expense related to certain intangible assets, as it represents a cost that may not recur and is not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance. We exclude accretion expense, both as it relates to asset retirement obligations as well as accrued restructuring charge liabilities, as these expenses represent costs which we believe are not meaningful in evaluating our current operations. We exclude stock-based compensation expense as it primarily represents expense attributed to equity awards that have no current or future cash obligations. As such, we, and many investors and analysts, exclude this stock-based compensation expense when assessing the cash generating performance of our continuing operations. We also exclude restructuring charges from our non-GAAP financial measures. The restructuring charges relate to our decisions to exit leases for excess space adjacent to several of our IBX data centers, which we did not intend to build out, or our decision to reverse such restructuring charges, or severance charges related to the Switch and Data acquisition. We also exclude impairment charges related to certain long-lived assets. The impairment charges related to expense recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets are not recoverable. Finally, we exclude acquisition costs from our non-GAAP financial measures. The acquisition costs relate to costs we incur in connection with business combinations. Management believes such items as restructuring charges, impairment charges and acquisition costs are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs will or may occur in future periods. Our management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. However, we have presented such non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. We believe that the inclusion of this non-GAAP financial measure provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance 55 Table of Contents of the business and its ability to perform in subsequent periods. We believe that if we did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze Equinix effectively. Investors should note, however, that the non-GAAP financial measures used by us may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. In addition, whenever we use non-GAAP financial measures, we provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from continuing operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges and acquisition costs as presented below (in thousands): Years ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Income from continuing operations $ 400,753 $ 305,254 $ 193,604 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 392,353 337,378 253,352 Stock-based compensation expense 83,868 71,137 67,243 Restructuring charges — 3,481 6,734 Impairment charges 9,861 — — Acquisition costs 8,822 3,297 12,337 Adjusted EBITDA $ 895,657 $ 720,547 $ 533,270 The geographic split of our adjusted EBITDA is presented below (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Americas: Income from continuing operations $ 258,620 $ 203,286 $ 120,011 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 235,391 213,464 163,599 Stock-based compensation expense 64,896 55,819 50,720 Restructuring charges — 3,481 6,734 Impairment charges 6,972 — — Acquisition costs (90 ) 2,614 11,094 Adjusted EBITDA $ 565,789 $ 478,664 $ 352,158 EMEA: Income from continuing operations $ 89,544 $ 59,420 $ 34,929 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 80,249 74,486 60,291 Stock-based compensation expense 10,370 8,869 9,397 Acquisition costs 3,979 371 1,065 Adjusted EBITDA $ 184,142 $ 143,146 $ 105,682 Asia-Pacific: Income from continuing operations $ 52,589 $ 42,548 $ 38,664 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 76,713 49,428 29,462 Stock-based compensation expense 8,602 6,449 7,126 Impairment charges 2,889 — — Acquisition costs 4,933 312 178 Adjusted EBITDA $ 145,726 $ 98,737 $ 75,430 56 Table of Contents Our adjusted EBITDA results have improved each year and in each region in total dollars due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in “Results of Operations”, as well as the nature of our business model consisting of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature also discussed earlier in “Overview”. Although we have also been investing in our future growth as described above (e.g. through additional IBX data center expansions, acquisitions and increased investments in sales and marketing), we believe that our adjusted EBITDA results will continue to improve in future periods as we continue to grow our business. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2012, our total indebtedness was comprised of (i) convertible debt principal totaling $769.7 million from our 3.00% convertible subordinated notes and our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes (gross of discount) and (ii) non-convertible debt and financing obligations totaling $2.3 billion consisting of (a) $1.5 billion of principal from our 8.125% senior notes and our 7.00% senior notes, (b) $241.0 million of principal from our loans payable and (c) $561.1 million from our capital lease and other financing obligations. In April 2012, virtually all of the holders of the 2.50% convertible subordinated notes converted their notes. We settled the $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the $250.0 million 2.50% convertible subordinated notes, plus accrued interest, in $253.1 million of cash and 622,867 shares of our common stock, which were issued from our treasury stock. In July 2012, we fully utilized the $200.0 million U.S. term loan to prepay and terminate the Asia-Pacific financing and fully-utilized the ALOG financing to prepay and terminate the existing outstanding ALOG loans payable and to fund ALOG operations. In November 2012, we received net proceeds of approximately $76.5 million upon the close of the divestiture. We believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of the current portion of our debt as it becomes due, payment of tax liabilities related to the decision to convert to a REIT (see below) and completion of our publicly-announced expansion projects. As of December 31, 2012, we had $546.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, of which approximately $363.2 million was held in the U.S. We believe that our current expansion activities in the U.S. can be funded with our U.S.-based cash and cash equivalents and investments. Besides our investment portfolio, additional liquidity available to us from the U.S. financing and any further financing activities we may pursue, customer collections are our primary source of cash. While we believe we have a strong customer base and have continued to experience relatively strong collections, if the current market conditions were to deteriorate, some of our customers may have difficulty paying us and we may experience increased churn in our customer base, including reductions in their commitments to us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Additionally, approximately 18% of our gross trade receivables are attributable to our EMEA region, and due to the risks posed by the current European debt crisis and credit downgrade, our EMEA-based customers may have difficulty paying us. As a result, our liquidity could be adversely impacted by the possibility of increasing trade receivable aging and higher allowances for doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 2012, we had a total of approximately $528.2 million of additional liquidity available to us under the U.S. financing. While we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our current operating requirements and to complete our publicly-announced IBX expansion plans, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build out of new IBX data centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as potential acquisitions, as well as our conversion to a REIT (see below). While we expect to fund these expansion plans with our existing resources, additional financing, either debt or equity, may be required to pursue certain new or unannounced additional expansion plans, including acquisitions. However, if current market conditions were to deteriorate, we may be unable to secure additional financing or any such additional financing may only be available to us on unfavorable terms. An inability to pursue additional expansion opportunities will have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our desired level of revenue growth in future periods. 57 Table of Contents Impact of REIT Conversion In accordance with tax rules applicable to REIT conversions, we expect to issue special distributions to our stockholders of undistributed accumulated earnings and profits of approximately $700.0 million to $1.1 billion, which is collectively referred to as the E&P distribution, which we expect to pay out in a combination of up to 20% in cash and at least 80% in the form of our common stock. We expect to make the E&P distribution only after receiving a favorable PLR from the IRS and anticipate making a significant portion of the E&P distribution before 2015, with the balance distributed in 2015. In addition, following the completion of the REIT conversion, we intend to declare regular distributions to our stockholders. There are significant tax and other costs associated with implementing the REIT conversion, and certain tax liabilities may be incurred regardless of the whether we ultimately succeed in converting to a REIT. We currently estimate that we will incur approximately $50.0 to $80.0 million in costs to support the REIT conversion, in addition to related tax liabilities associated with a change in our method of depreciating and amortizing various data center assets for tax purposes from our current method to methods that are more consistent with the characterization of such assets as real property for REIT purposes. The total recapture of depreciation and amortization expenses across all relevant assets is expected to result in federal and state tax liability of approximately $340.0 to $420.0 million, which amount will be payable in the four-year period starting in 2012 even if we abandon the REIT conversion for any reason, including the failure to receive the PLR we are seeking. We utilized all our net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes in 2012. If the REIT conversion is successful, we also expect to incur an additional $5.0 to $10.0 million in annual compliance costs in future years. Sources and Uses of Cash Years ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 632,026 $ 587,609 $ 392,872 Net cash used in investing activities (442,873 ) (1,499,444 ) (600,969 ) Net cash provided (used in) by financing activities (222,721 ) 748,728 309,686 Operating Activities The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2012 compared to 2011 and 2010 was primarily due to improved operating results and growth in customer installations. Although our collections remain strong, it is possible for some large customer receivables that were anticipated to be collected in one quarter to slip to the next quarter. For example, some large customer receivables that were anticipated to be collected in December 2012 were instead collected in January 2013, which negatively impacted cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2012. We expect that we will continue to generate cash from our operating activities throughout 2013 and beyond; however, we expect to pay an increased amount of income taxes until such time that we become a REIT, which will negatively impact the cash we generate from operating activities. Investing Activities The decrease in net cash used in investing activities during 2012 compared to 2011 and 2010 was primarily due to lower purchases of investments, which were $442.9 million during 2012 as compared to $1.3 billion and $744.8 million during 2011 and 2010, respectively, partially offset by higher capital expenditures and acquisitions. During 2013, we expect that our IBX expansion construction activity will be less than our 2012 levels. However, if the opportunity to expand is greater than planned and we have sufficient funding to pursue such expansion opportunities, we may increase the level of capital expenditures to support this growth as well as pursue additional acquisitions or joint ventures. 58 Table of Contents Financing Activities The net cash used in financing activities for 2012 was primarily due to the repayment of the Asia-Pacific financing and the settlement of the $250.0 million 2.50% convertible subordinated notes, partially offset by proceeds from the U.S. financing and the ALOG financing. The net cash provided by financing activities for 2011 was primarily due to our $750.0 million 7.00% senior notes offering in July 2011, partially offset by $86.7 million purchases of treasury stock and $33.3 million repayment of our debt. The net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily due to our $750.0 million 8.125% senior notes offering in February 2010 and approximately $63.4 million of incremental net proceeds from the Asia-Pacific financing, which replaced our previous Asia-Pacific financing and Singapore financing, partially offset by $328.6 million of repayments of various other debt facilities. Going forward, we expect that our financing activities will consist primarily of repayment of our debt and additional financings needed to support expansion opportunities, additional acquisitions or joint ventures, or our conversion to a REIT. Debt Obligations—Convertible Debt 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes. In June 2009, we issued $373.8 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% convertible subordinated notes due June 15, 2016. Interest is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year and commenced on December 15, 2009. The initial conversion rate is 11.8599 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. This represents an initial conversion price of approximately $84.32 per share of common stock. Upon conversion, holders will receive, at our election, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2012, the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes were convertible into 4.4 million shares of our common stock. Holders of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes were eligible to convert their notes during fiscal quarters ended June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2012, since the sale price of our common stock, for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of those fiscal quarters, was greater than 130% of the conversion price per share of common stock on such last trading day. Upon conversion, if we elected to pay a sufficiently large portion of the conversion obligation in cash, additional consideration beyond the $373.8 million of gross proceeds received would be required. However, to minimize the impact of potential dilution upon conversion of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, we entered into capped call transactions, which are referred to as the capped call, separate from the issuance of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, for which we paid a premium of $49.7 million. The capped call covers a total of approximately 4.4 million shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment. Under the capped call, we effectively raised the conversion price of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes from $84.32 to $114.82. Depending upon our stock price at the time the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes are converted, the capped call will return up to 1.2 million shares of our common stock to us; however, we will receive no benefit from the capped call if our stock price is $84.32 or lower at the time of conversion and will receive less shares for share prices in excess of $114.82 at the time of conversion than we would have received at a share price of $114.82 (our benefit from the capped call is capped at $114.82, and no additional benefit is received beyond this price). We do not have the right to redeem the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes at our option. We separately accounted for the liability and equity components of our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes in accordance with the accounting standard for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement). For additional information, see “4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes” in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 59 Table of Contents 3.00% Convertible Subordinated Notes. In September 2007, we issued $396.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Convertible Subordinated Notes due October 15, 2014. Interest is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year and commenced in April 2008. Holders of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes may convert their notes at their option on any day up to and including the business day immediately preceding the maturity date into shares of our common stock. The base conversion rate is 7.436 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. This represents a base conversion price of approximately $134.48 per share of common stock. If, at the time of conversion, the applicable stock price of our common stock exceeds the base conversion price, the conversion rate will be determined pursuant to a formula resulting in the receipt of up to 4.4616 additional shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. However, in no event would the total number of shares issuable upon conversion of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes exceed 11.8976 per $1,000 principal amount of 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, or the equivalent of $84.05 per share of our common stock or a total of 4.7 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2012, the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes were convertible into 3.6 million shares of our common stock. We do not have the right to redeem the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes at our option. Debt Obligations—Non-Convertible Debt Senior Notes 7.00% Senior Notes. In July 2011, we issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.00% senior notes due July 15, 2021, which are referred to as the 7.00% senior notes. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year and commenced on January 15, 2012. The 7.00% senior notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to our existing or future senior debt and senior in right of payment to our existing and future subordinated debt. The 7.00% senior notes are effectively junior to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries. The 7.00% senior notes are also structurally subordinated to all debt and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries and will continue to be subordinated to the extent that these subsidiaries do not guarantee the 7.00% senior notes in the future. The 7.00% Senior Notes are governed by an indenture which contains covenants that limit the Company’s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to, among other things: • incur additional debt; • pay dividends or make other restricted payments; • purchase, redeem or retire capital stock or subordinated debt; • make asset sales; • enter into transactions with affiliates; • incur liens; • enter into sale-leaseback transactions; • provide subsidiary guarantees; • make investments; and • merge or consolidate with any other person. At any time prior to July 15, 2014, we may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 7.00% senior notes outstanding at a redemption price equal to 107.000% of the principal amount of the 7.00% senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings, provided that (i) at 60 Table of Contents least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the 7.00% senior notes issued remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption and (ii) the redemption must occur within 90 days of the date of the closing of such equity offerings. On or after July 15, 2016, we may redeem all or a part of the 7.00% senior notes, on any one or more occasions, at the redemption prices set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, up to, but not including, the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on July 15 of the years indicated below: Redemption price of theSenior Notes 2016 103.500 % 2017 102.333 % 2018 101.167 % 2019 and thereafter 100.000 % In addition, at any time prior to July 15, 2016, we may also redeem all or a part of the 7.00% senior notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 7.00% senior notes redeemed plus a premium, which is referred to as the applicable premium, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption, which is referred to as the redemption date. The applicable premium means the greater of: • 1.0% of the principal amount of the 7.00% senior notes to be redeemed; and • the excess of: (a) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the redemption price of the 7.00% senior notes to be redeemed at July 15, 2016 as shown in the above table, plus (ii) all required interest payments due on these 7.00% senior notes through July 15, 2016 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including the redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the yield to maturity as of the redemption date of the U.S. Treasury securities with a constant maturity most nearly equal to the period from the redemption date to July 15, 2016, plus 0.50%; over (b) the principal amount of the 7.00% senior notes to be redeemed. Upon a change in control, we will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder’s 7.00% senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. Debt issuance costs related to the 7.00% senior notes, net of amortization, were $12.1 million as of December 31, 2012. 8.125% Senior Notes. In February 2010, we issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% senior notes due March 1, 2018, which are referred to as the senior notes. Interest is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year and commenced on September 1, 2010. The senior notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to our existing or future senior debt and senior in right of payment to our existing and future subordinated debt. The senior notes will be effectively junior to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries. The senior notes are governed by an indenture which contains covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things: • incur additional debt; • pay dividends or make other restricted payments; • purchase, redeem or retire capital stock or subordinated debt; • make asset sales; • enter into transactions with affiliates; • incur liens; 61 Table of Contents • enter into sale-leaseback transactions; • provide subsidiary guarantees; • make investments; and • merge or consolidate with any other person. At any time prior to March 1, 2013, we may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes outstanding at a redemption price equal to 108.125% of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings, provided that (i) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption and (ii) the redemption must occur within 90 days of the date of the closing of such equity offerings. On or after March 1, 2014, we may redeem all or a part of the 8.125% senior notes, on any one or more occasions, at the redemption prices set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the one-year period beginning on March 1 of the years indicated below: Redemption price of thesenior notes 2014 104.0625 % 2015 102.0313 % 2016 and thereafter 100.0000 % In addition, at any time prior to March 1, 2014, we may also redeem all or a part of the senior notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the senior notes redeemed plus an applicable premium plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption. Upon a change in control, we will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder’s senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. Debt issuance costs related to the 8.125% senior notes, net of amortization, were $9.4 million as of December 31, 2012. Loans Payable U.S. Financing. In June 2012, we entered into a credit agreement with a group of lenders for a $750.0 million credit facility, referred to as the U.S. financing, comprised of a $200.0 million term loan facility, referred to as the U.S. term loan, and a $550.0 million multicurrency revolving credit facility, referred to as the U.S. revolving credit line. The U.S. financing contains several financial covenants with which we must comply on a quarterly basis, including a maximum senior leverage ratio covenant, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant and a minimum tangible net worth covenant. The U.S. financing is guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries and is secured by our and the guarantors’ accounts receivable as well as pledges of the equity interests of certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries. The U.S. term loan and U.S. revolving credit line both have a five-year term, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions with respect to our outstanding convertible subordinated notes. We are required to repay the principal balance of the U.S. term loan in equal quarterly installments over the term. The U.S. term loan bears interest at a rate based on LIBOR or, at our option, the base rate, which is defined as the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (b) the Bank of America prime rate and (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus, in either case, a margin that varies as a function of our senior leverage ratio in the range of 1.25%-2.00% per annum if we elect to use the LIBOR index and in the range of 0.25%-1.00% per annum if we elect to use the base rate index. In July 2012, we fully utilized the U.S. term loan and used the funds to prepay the outstanding balance of and terminate the Asia-Pacific financing (see below). As of December 31, 2012, we had $180.0 million outstanding under the U.S. term loan with an effective interest rate of 2.36% per annum. 62 Table of Contents The U.S. revolving credit line allows us to borrow, repay and reborrow over the term. The U.S. revolving credit line provides a sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit of up to $150.0 million at any one time. We may use the U.S. revolving credit line for working capital, capital expenditures, issuance of letters of credit, and other general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the U.S. revolving credit line bear interest at a rate based on LIBOR or, at our option, the base rate, as defined above, plus, in either case, a margin that varies as a function of our senior leverage ratio in the range of 0.95%-1.60% per annum if we elect to use the LIBOR index and in the range of 0.00%-0.60% per annum if we elect to use the base rate index. We are required to pay a quarterly letter of credit fee on the face amount of each letter of credit, which fee is based on the same margin that applies from time to time to LIBOR-indexed borrowings under the U.S. revolving credit line. We are also required to pay a quarterly facility fee ranging from 0.30%-0.40% per annum of the U.S. revolving credit line, regardless of the amount utilized, which fee also varies as a function of our senior leverage ratio. In June 2012, the outstanding letters of credit issued under the senior revolving credit line (see below) were assumed under the U.S. revolving credit line and the senior revolving credit line was terminated. As of December 31, 2012, we had 14 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $21.8 million issued and outstanding under the U.S. revolving credit line. As a result, the amount available to us to borrow under the U.S. revolving credit line was $528.2 million as of December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with all covenants of the U.S. financing. Debt issuance costs related to the U.S. financing, net of amortization, were $8.0 million as of December 31, 2012. ALOG Financing. In June 2012, ALOG completed a 100.0 million Brazilian real credit facility agreement, or approximately $48.8 million, referred to as the ALOG financing. The ALOG financing has a five-year term with semi-annual principal payments beginning in the third year of its term and quarterly interest payments during the entire term. The ALOG financing bears an interest rate of 2.75% above the local borrowing rate. The ALOG financing contains financial covenants, which ALOG must comply with annually, consisting of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the ALOG financing. The ALOG financing is not guaranteed by ALOG or us. The ALOG financing is not secured by ALOG’s or our assets. The ALOG financing has a final maturity date of June 2017. In September 2012, ALOG fully utilized the ALOG financing and used a portion of the funds to prepay and terminate ALOG loans payable outstanding. As of December 31, 2012, the effective interest rate under the ALOG financing was 10.21% per annum. Paris 4 IBX Financing. In March 2011, we entered into two agreements with two unrelated parties to purchase and develop a building that became our fourth IBX data center in the Paris metro area, which opened for business in August 2012. The first agreement, as amended, allowed us the right to purchase the property for a total fee of approximately $19.8 million, payable to a company that held exclusive rights (including power rights) to the property and was already in the process of developing the property into a data center and has, instead, become the anchor tenant in the Paris 4 IBX data center once it opened for business. The second agreement was entered into with the developer of the property and allowed us to take immediate title to the building and associated land and also requires the developer to construct the data center to our specifications and deliver the completed data center to us in July 2012 for a total fee of approximately $101.5 million. Both agreements include extended payment terms. We made payments under both agreements totaling approximately $78.3 million and $35.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and the remaining payments due are payable on various dates through June 2013, which is referred to as the Paris 4 IBX financing. Of the amounts paid or payable under the Paris 4 IBX financing, a total of approximately $14.8 million was allocated to land and building assets, $3.4 million was allocated to a deferred charge, which is being netted against revenue associated with the anchor tenant of the Paris 4 IBX data center over the term of the customer contract, and the remainder totaling $103.1 million was or will be allocated to construction costs inclusive of interest charges. We have imputed an interest rate of 7.86% per annum on the Paris 4 IBX financing as of December 31, 2012. The Paris 4 IBX financing also required us to post approximately $89.5 million of cash into a restricted cash account to ensure liquidity for the developer during the construction period. Payments due to the developer of the property during the year ended December 31, 2012 were paid from the restricted cash account. As a result, our current restricted cash balances have decreased. 63 Table of Contents Capital Lease and Other Financing Obligations We have numerous capital lease and other financing obligations with maturity dates ranging from 2015 to 2030 under which a total principal balance of $561.1 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2012 with a weighted average effective interest rate of 8.62%. For further information on our capital leases and other financing obligations, see “Capital Leases and Other Financing Obligations” in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements We lease a majority of our IBX data centers and certain land and equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements expiring through 2035. The following represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012 (in thousands): 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter Total Convertible debt (1) $ — $ 395,986 $ — $ 373,730 $ — $ — $ 769,716 Senior notes (1) — — — — — 1,500,000 1,500,000 U.S. term loan (1) 40,000 40,000 40,000 40,000 20,000 — 180,000 ALOG financing (1) — 13,945 13,945 13,945 6,972 — 48,807 Paris 4 IBX financing (2) 8,071 — — — — — 8,071 Interest (3) 151,583 147,923 136,252 125,111 114,054 240,638 915,561 Capital lease and other financing obligations (4) 55,512 60,885 63,922 63,875 62,916 473,754 780,864 Operating leases under accrued restructuring charges (5) 2,453 2,459 1,444 — — — 6,356 Operating leases (6) 114,736 110,400 92,199 81,048 117,965 409,979 926,327 Other contractual commitments (7) 251,997 58,953 30,024 111 — — 341,085 Asset retirement obligations (8) 225 5,856 8,380 465 6,480 41,744 63,150 ALOG acquisition contingent consideration (9) 17,571 — — — — — 17,571 Redeemable non-controlling interests — 84,178 — — — — 84,178 $ 642,148 $ 920,585 $ 386,166 $ 698,285 $ 328,387 $ 2,666,115 $ 5,641,686 (1) Represents principal only. (2) Represents total payments to be made under two agreements to purchase and develop the Paris 4 IBX center. (3) Represents interest on ALOG financing, convertible debt, senior notes and U.S. term loan based on their approximate interest rates as of December 31, 2012. (4) Represents principal and interest. (5) Excludes any subrental income. (6) Represents minimum operating lease payments, excluding potential lease renewals. (7) Represents off-balance sheet arrangements. Other contractual commitments are described below. (8) Represents liability, net of future accretion expense. (9) Represents an off-balance sheet arrangement for the ALOG acquisition contingent consideration, subject to reduction for any post-closing balance sheet adjustments and any claims for indemnification, and includes the portion of the contingent consideration that will be funded by Riverwood Capital L.P., who has an indirect, non-controlling equity interest in ALOG. In connection with certain of our leases, we entered into 14 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $21.8 million under the U.S. revolving credit line. These letters of credit were provided in lieu of cash deposits under 64 Table of Contents the revolving credit line. If the landlords for these IBX leases decide to draw down on these letters of credit triggered by an event of default under the lease, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowing under the senior revolving credit line. These contingent commitments are not reflected in the table above. We had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaling approximately $19.4 million as of December 31, 2012. These liabilities, which are reflected on our balance sheet, are not reflected in the table above since it is unclear when these liabilities will be paid. Primarily as a result of our various IBX expansion projects, as of December 31, 2012, we were contractually committed for $78.9 million of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for IBX equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided in connection with the work necessary to complete construction and open these IBX data centers prior to making them available to customers for installation. This amount, which is expected to be paid during 2013 and thereafter, is reflected in the table above as “other contractual commitments.” We had other non-capital purchase commitments in place as of December 31, 2012, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods or services to be delivered or provided during 2013 and beyond. Such other purchase commitments as of December 31, 2012 which total $262.2 million are also reflected in the table above as “other contractual commitments.” In addition, although we are not contractually obligated to do so, we expect to incur additional capital expenditures of approximately $180 million to $220 million, in addition to the $78.9 million in contractual commitments discussed above as of December 31, 2012, in our various IBX expansion projects during 2013 and thereafter in order to complete the work needed to open these IBX data centers. These non-contractual capital expenditures are not reflected in the table above. If we so choose, whether due to economic factors or other considerations, we could delay these non-contractual capital expenditure commitments to preserve liquidity. Other Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements In November 2012, we entered into a lease for land and a building that we and the landlord would jointly develop to meet our needs and which we would ultimately convert into an IBX data center in the Toronto, Canada metro area. We refer to this transaction as the Toronto lease. The Toronto lease was contingent on the landlord’s ability to obtain construction financing, which occurred in February 2013. The Toronto lease has a fixed term of 15 years, with options to renew, and a total cumulative minimum rent obligation of approximately $141.7 million, exclusive of renewal periods. We have various guarantor arrangements with both our directors and officers and third parties, including customers, vendors and business partners. As of December 31, 2012, there were no significant liabilities recorded for these arrangements. For additional information, see “Guarantor Arrangements” in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. 65 Table of Contents Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates, among others, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require significant judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain: • Accounting for income taxes; • Accounting for business combinations; • Accounting for impairment of goodwill; and • Accounting for property, plant and equipment. Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid. The accounting standard for income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined by the accounting standard as a likelihood of more than 50%) such assets will not be realized. A tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authority’s widely understood administrative practices and precedents. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future events. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. If, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account a number of types of evidence, including the following: 1) the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, 2) sources of future taxable income and 3) tax planning strategies. In assessing the tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position, the tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had total net deferred tax liabilities of $38.6 million and $58.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had a total valuation allowance of $43.8 million and $39.6 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we decided to provide a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets associated with certain foreign operating entities, which resulted in an income tax expense of $5.4 million in our results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we decided to release the valuation allowance associated with certain foreign operating entities which resulted in an income tax benefit of $2.5 million in our results of operations. Our decisions to release our valuation allowances were based on our belief that the operations of these regions had achieved a sufficient level of profitability and will sustain a sufficient level of profitability in the future to support the release of these valuation allowances based on relevant facts and circumstances. However, if our assumptions on the future performance of these jurisdictions prove not to be correct and these jurisdictions are not able to sustain a sufficient level of profitability to support the associated deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet, we will have to impair our deferred tax assets through an additional valuation allowance, which would impact our financial position and results of operations in the period such a determination is made. 66 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Our remaining valuation allowances as of December 31, 2012 total $43.8 million and primarily relates to certain of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. If and when we release our remaining valuation allowances, it will have a favorable impact to our financial position and results of operations in the periods such determinations are made. We will continue to assess the need for our valuation allowances, by country or location, in the future. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $25.0 million and $34.0 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $9.0 million primarily resulting from the settlement of a tax audit and the lapse of statute of limitations in our foreign operations. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the unrecognized tax benefits increased by $17.5 million primarily resulting from the ALOG acquisition. The unrecognized tax benefits of $25.0 million as of December 31, 2012, if subsequently recognized, will affect our effective tax rate favorably at the time when such benefits are recognized. Accounting for Business Combinations In accordance with the accounting standard for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as customer contracts, leases and any other significant assets or liabilities and contingent consideration. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date if we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed. Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires assumptions and management’s judgment to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. During the last three years, we have completed several business combinations, including the Dubai IBX data center acquisition in November 2012, the Asia Tone and ancotel acquisitions in July 2012, ALOG acquisition in April 2011 and Switch and Data acquisition in April 2010. Our measurement period for the Asia Tone and ancotel acquisitions will remain open through the third quarter of 2013. The purchase price allocation for the ALOG and the Switch and Data acquisitions was completed in the second quarter of 2012 and the second quarter of 2011, respectively. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we used to complete the purchase price allocations and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, which would be recorded in our statements of operations commencing in 2013. 67 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Accounting for Impairment of Goodwill In accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform goodwill impairment reviews annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we early adopted the accounting standard update for testing goodwill for impairment. The accounting standard update provides companies with the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If, after assessing the qualitative factors, a company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. However, if a company concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we completed annual goodwill impairment reviews of the Americas reporting unit, the EMEA reporting unit and the Asia-Pacific reporting unit and concluded that there was no impairment as the fair value of these reporting units exceeded their carrying value. When we elect to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test, we use both the income and market approach. Under the income approach, we develop a five-year cash flow forecast and use our weighted-average cost of capital applicable to our reporting units as discount rates. This requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. When we elect to perform the goodwill impairment test by assessing qualitative factors determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value requires assumptions and estimates, the assessment also requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. These assumptions require significant management judgment and are inherently subject to uncertainties. Future events, changing market conditions and any changes in key assumptions may result in an impairment charge. While we have never recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill to date, the development of adverse business conditions in our Americas, EMEA or Asia-Pacific reporting units, such as higher than anticipated customer churn or significantly increased operating costs, or significant deterioration of our market comparables that we use in the market approach, could result in an impairment charge in future periods. As of December 31, 2012, goodwill attributable to the Americas reporting unit, the EMEA reporting unit and the Asia-Pacific reporting unit was $482.8 million, $423.5 million and $136.3 million, respectively. Any potential impairment charge against our goodwill would not exceed the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Accounting for Property, Plant and Equipment We have a substantial amount of property, plant and equipment recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The vast majority of our property, plant and equipment represent the costs incurred to build out or acquire our IBX data centers. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets. The majority of our IBX data centers are in properties that are leased. We depreciate our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (subject to the term of the lease in the case of leased assets or leasehold improvements). While there are numerous judgments and uncertainties involved in accounting for property, plant and equipment that are significant, arriving at the estimated useful life of an asset requires the most critical judgment for us and changes to these estimates would have the most significant impact to our financial position and results of operations. When we lease a property for our IBX data centers, we generally enter into long-term arrangements with initial lease terms of at least 8-10 years and with renewal options generally available to us. During the next several years, a number of leases for our IBX data centers will come up for renewal. As we start approaching the end of these initial lease terms, we will need to reassess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment. In addition, we During the quarter ended December 31, 2012, we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment. As a result, we recorded approximately $5.0 million of lower depreciation expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2012 due to extending the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment. We undertook this review due to our determination that we were generally using certain of our existing assets longer than originally anticipated and, therefore, the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment has been lengthened. This change was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis effective October 1, 2012 under the accounting standard for change in accounting estimates. 68 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Accounting for property, plant and equipment involves a number of accounting issues including determining the appropriate period in which to depreciate such assets, making assessments for leased properties to determine whether they are capital or operating leases, assessing such assets for potential impairment, capitalizing interest during periods of construction and assessing the asset retirement obligations required for certain leased properties that require us to return the leased properties back to their original condition at the time we decide to exit a leased property. may find that our estimates for the useful lives of non-leased assets may also need to be revised periodically. In many cases, we arrived at these estimates during 1999 when we opened our first three IBX data centers. We periodically review the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment and changes in these estimates in the future are possible. Another area of judgment for us in connection with our property, plant and equipment is related to lease accounting. Most of our IBX data centers are leased. Each time we enter into a new lease or lease amendment for one of our IBX data centers, we analyze each lease or lease amendment for the proper accounting. This requires certain judgments on our part such as establishing the lease term to include in a lease test, establishing the remaining estimated useful life of the underlying property or equipment and estimating the fair value of the underlying property or equipment. All of these judgments are inherently uncertain. Different assumptions or estimates could result in a different accounting treatment for a lease. The assessment of long-lived assets for impairment requires assumptions and estimates of undiscounted and discounted future cash flows. These assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and are inherently uncertain. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded impairment charges totaling $9.9 million associated with certain long-lived assets, of which $7.0 million was associated with property, plant and equipment. No impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had property, plant and equipment of $3.9 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recorded depreciation expense of $365.9 million, $328.6 million and $246.5 million, respectively. Further changes in our estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment could have a significant impact to our results of operations.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk The following discussion about market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity. We employ foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging certain specifically-identified exposures. The use of these financial instruments is intended to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, but does not eliminate such risks. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 69 Table of Contents Investment Portfolio Risk We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. All of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale and, therefore, are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax. We consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge for our securities, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. The Company anticipates that it will recover the entire cost basis of these securities and has determined that no other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were required to be recognized during the year ended December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market fund investments, U.S. government and agency obligations, commercial paper and certificates of deposits, corporate bonds, and asset backed securities. Excluding the U.S. government holdings, which carry a lower risk and lower return in comparison to other securities in the portfolio, the remaining amount in our investment portfolio that could be susceptible to market risk totaled $343.6 million. Interest Rate Risk Our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates or credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Securities with longer maturities are subject to a greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities. As of December 31, 2012 the average duration of our portfolio was less than one year. An immediate hypothetical shift in the yield curves of plus or minus 50 basis points from their position as of December 31, 2012, could decrease or increase the fair value of our investment portfolio by approximately $1.0 million. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift of all interest rates, however, interest rates do not always move in such a manner and actual results may differ materially. We monitor our interest rate and credit risk, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers. There were no impairment charges on our cash equivalents and fixed income securities during the year ended December 31, 2012. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates from their position as of December 31, 2012 would not have a material impact on our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of the majority of our debt obligations. However, the interest expense associated with our U.S. financing and ALOG financing, which bear interest at variable rates could be affected. For every 100 basis point change in interest rates, our annual interest expense could increase or decrease by a total of approximately $2.3 million based on the total balance of our primary borrowings under the U.S. term loan and the ALOG financing as of December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, we had not employed any interest rate derivative products to manage our debt obligations. However, we may enter into interest rate hedging agreements in the future to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk. The fair value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate changes may affect the fair value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair value of our convertible debt, which is traded in the market, is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of our loans payable, which are not traded in the market, is estimated by considering our credit rating, current rates available to us for debt of the same remaining maturities and the terms of the debt. The following table represents the carrying value and estimated fair value of our loans payable, senior notes and convertible debt as of (in thousands): December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 CarryingValue Fair Value CarryingValue Fair Value Loans payable $ 240,962 $ 238,793 $ 256,235 $ 269,451 Convertible debt 708,726 1,144,568 941,084 1,057,801 Senior Notes 1,500,000 1,661,400 1,500,000 1,612,287 70 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Risk The majority of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, generated mostly from customers in the U.S. However, approximately 44% of both our revenues and operating costs are attributable to Brazil, Canada and the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions and a large portion of those revenues and costs are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Brazilian Reais, Canadian dollar, British pound, Euro, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Chinese Yuan, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar. As a result, our operating results and cash flows are impacted by currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. To protect against certain reductions in value caused by changes in currency exchange rates, we have established a risk management program to offset some of the risk of carrying assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Our risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements and its impact on the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2012, the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of less than one year. For the foreseeable future, we anticipate that approximately 40-50% of our revenues and operating costs will continue to be generated and incurred outside of the U.S. in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. While we hedge certain of our balance sheet foreign currency assets and liabilities, we currently do not hedge revenue. During fiscal 2012, the U.S. dollar was generally strong relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate. This overall strength of the U.S. dollar had a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations because the foreign denominations translated into less U.S. dollars. In future periods, the volatility of the U.S. dollar as compared to the other currencies in which we do business could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations including the amount of revenue that we report in future periods. We may enter into additional hedging activities in the future to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency risk as our exposure to foreign currency risk continues to increase due to our growing foreign operations; however, we do not currently intend to eliminate all foreign currency transaction exposure. Commodity Price Risk Certain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of price changes are electricity, supplies and equipment used in our IBX data centers. We closely monitor the cost of electricity at all of our locations. We have entered into several power contracts to purchase power at fixed prices during 2013 and beyond in certain locations in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom. In addition, as we are building new, or expanding existing, IBX data centers, we are subject to commodity price risk for building materials related to the construction of these IBX data centers, such as steel and copper. In addition, the lead-time to procure certain pieces of equipment, such as generators, is substantial. Any delays in procuring the necessary pieces of equipment for the construction of our IBX data centers could delay the anticipated openings of these new IBX data centers and, as a result, increase the cost of these projects. We do not currently employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to address commodity price risk other than the power contracts discussed above.",2023-12-30 20:28:21.036166

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information in this discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements are based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. For example, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist readers in understanding our financial information from our management’s perspective and is presented as follows: • Overview • Results of Operations • Non-GAAP Financial Measures • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements • Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates • Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2013, as more fully described in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we announced a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $500.0 million of our common stock in open market transactions through December 31, 2014, which is referred to as the share repurchase program. In October 2013, as more fully described in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we acquired a property located in Frankfurt, Germany for cash consideration of approximately $50.1 million, which is referred to as the Frankfurt Kleyer 90 carrier hotel acquisition. A portion of the building was leased to us and was being used by us as our Frankfurt 5 IBX data center. The remainder of the building was leased by other parties, who became our tenants upon closing. The Frankfurt Kleyer 90 carrier hotel constitutes a business under the accounting standard for business combinations and as a result, the Frankfurt Kleyer 90 carrier hotel acquisition was accounted for as a business acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting. In July 2013, as more fully described in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed the purchase of a property located in the New York metro area for a net cash consideration of $73.4 million, which is referred to as the New York 2 IBX data center purchase. A majority of the building was leased to us and was being used by us as our New York 2 IBX data center. The remainder of the building was leased by another party, who became our tenant upon closing. The New York 2 IBX data center did not constitute a business under the accounting standard for business combinations and as a result, the New York 2 IBX data center purchase was accounted for as an asset acquisition and the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired based on their relative fair values. In April 2013, as more fully described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we redeemed all of our $750.0 million 8.125% senior notes, plus accrued interest, with $836.5 million in cash, which includes the applicable premium paid of $80.9 million. During the three months ended June 30, 2013, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $93.6 million, which included the applicable premium paid, the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of $8.9 million and $3.8 million of other transaction-related fees related to the redemption of the 8.125% senior notes. 38 Table of Contents In March 2013, as more fully described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, which is referred to as the senior notes offering, consisting of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due April 1, 2020, which are referred to as the 4.875% senior notes, and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due April 1, 2023, which are referred to as the 5.375% senior notes. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the senior notes offering for the redemption of our 8.125% senior notes and intend to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the funding of our expansion activities and distributions to our stockholders in connection with our proposed conversion to a real estate investment trust, which is referred to as a REIT. Overview Equinix provides global data center offerings that protect and connect the world’s most valued information assets. Global enterprises, financial services companies, and content and network service providers rely upon Equinix’s leading insight and data centers in 32 markets around the world for the safehousing of their critical IT equipment and the ability to directly connect to the networks that enable today’s information-driven economy. Equinix offers the following solutions: (i) premium data center colocation, (ii) interconnection and (iii) exchange and outsourced IT infrastructure services. As of December 31 2013, we operated or had partner IBX data centers in the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Rio De Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Seattle, Silicon Valley, Toronto and Washington, D.C. metro areas in the Americas region; France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom in the EMEA region; and Australia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan and Singapore in the Asia-Pacific region. We leverage our global data centers in 32 markets around the world as a global platform which allows our customers to increase information and application delivery performance while significantly reducing costs. Based on our global platform and the quality of our IBX data centers, we believe we have established a critical mass of customers. As more customers locate in our IBX data centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate as well in order to gain the full economic and performance benefits of our offerings. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a “marketplace” for their services. Our global platform enables scalable, reliable and cost-effective colocation, interconnection and traffic exchange thus lowering overall cost and increasing flexibility. Our focused business model is based on our critical mass of customers and the resulting “marketplace” effect. This global platform, combined with our strong financial position, continues to drive new customer growth and bookings as we drive scale into our global business. Historically, our market has been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled their telecommunications products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include cloud computing/utility providers, application hosting providers and systems integrators, managed infrastructure hosting providers and colocation providers with over 350 companies providing data center solutions in the U.S. alone. Each of these data center solutions providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings, and outsourced IT infrastructure services. We are able to offer our customers a global platform that supports global reach to 16 countries, proven operational reliability, improved application performance and network choice, and a highly scalable set of offerings. 39 Table of Contents Excluding the impact of the acquisition of the Dubai IBX data center, our customer count increased to approximately 5,954 as of December 31, 2013 versus approximately 5,110 as of December 31, 2012, an increase of 17%. This increase was due to organic growth in our business. Our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus net sellable cabinet space available, taking into account power limitations. Our utilization rate was approximately 76% as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012; however, excluding the impact of our IBX data center expansion projects that have opened during the last 12 months, our utilization rate would have increased to approximately 82% as of December 31, 2013. Our utilization rate varies from market to market among our IBX data centers across the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain of our high power demand customers. This increased power consumption has driven the requirement to build out our new IBX data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX data centers. We could face power limitations in our IBX data centers even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific IBX data center. This could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows. Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and offerings. As was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors such as demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to break-even on a free cash flow basis and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. Depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to Equinix standards. Property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant. Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related interconnection and managed infrastructure offerings. We consider these offerings recurring because our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. In addition, during the past three years, in any given quarter, greater than half of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer’s initial deployment and professional services that we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring because they are billed typically once upon completion of the installation or professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. However, revenues from installation services are deferred and recognized ratably over the expected life of the installation. Additionally, revenue from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is recognized when no remaining performance obligations exist and collectability is reasonably assured, to the extent that the revenue has not previously been recognized. As a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future. Our Americas revenues are derived primarily from colocation and related interconnection offerings, and our EMEA and Asia-Pacific revenues are derived primarily from colocation and managed infrastructure offerings. The largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX data centers, utility costs, including electricity and bandwidth, IBX data center employees’ salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment and security services. A substantial majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing IBX data centers or open or acquire new IBX data centers. However, there are certain costs which are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies, that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. We expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will generally increase in the future on a per-unit or fixed basis in addition to the variable increase related to the growth in consumption by our customers. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months as compared to other times of the year. To the extent we incur increased utility costs, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, to the extent we incur increased electricity costs as a result of either climate change policies or the physical effects of climate change, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 40 Table of Contents Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer contract intangible assets. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees, and other general corporate expenses such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and some depreciation expense. Due to our recurring revenue model, and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature and generally does not grow in proportion to revenue growth, we expect our cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses to decline as a percentage of revenues over time, although we expect each of them to grow in absolute dollars in connection with our growth. This is evident in the trends noted below in our discussion about our results of operations. However, for cost of revenues, this trend may periodically be impacted when a large expansion project opens or is acquired and before it starts generating any meaningful revenue. Furthermore, in relation to cost of revenues, we note that the Americas region has a lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue than either EMEA or Asia-Pacific. This is due to both the increased scale and maturity of the Americas region compared to either the EMEA or Asia-Pacific region, as well as a higher cost structure outside of the Americas, particularly in EMEA. While we expect all three regions to continue to see lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in future periods, we expect the trend of the Americas having the lowest cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to continue. As a result, to the extent that revenue growth outside the Americas grows in greater proportion than revenue growth in the Americas, our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may increase in future periods. Sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses may also periodically increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth. Potential REIT Conversion In September 2012, we announced that our board of directors approved a plan for Equinix to pursue conversion to a REIT. We have begun implementation of the REIT conversion, and we plan to make a tax election for REIT status for the taxable year beginning January 1, 2015. Any REIT election made by us must be effective as of the beginning of a taxable year; therefore, as a calendar year taxpayer, if we are unable to convert to a REIT by January 1, 2015, the next possible conversion date would be January 1, 2016. If we are able to convert to and qualify as a REIT, we will generally be permitted to deduct from federal income taxes the dividends we pay to our stockholders. The income represented by such dividends would not be subject to federal taxation at the entity level but would be taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. Nevertheless, the income of our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRS, which will hold our U.S. operations that may not be REIT-compliant, will be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income tax. Likewise, our foreign subsidiaries will continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through TRS or through qualified REIT subsidiaries, or QRS. We will also be subject to a separate corporate income tax on any gains recognized during a specified period (generally 10 years) following the REIT conversion that are attributable to “built-in” gains with respect to the assets that we own on the date we convert to a REIT. Our ability to qualify as a REIT will depend upon our continuing compliance following our REIT conversion with various requirements, including requirements related to the nature of our assets, the sources of our income and the distributions to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our TRS operations. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the federal income tax regime for REITs described above, many states do not completely follow federal rules and some may not follow them at all. 41 Table of Contents The REIT conversion implementation currently includes seeking a private letter ruling, or PLR, from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or IRS. Our PLR request has multiple components, and our timely conversion to a REIT will require favorable rulings from the IRS on certain technical tax issues. We submitted the PLR request to the IRS in the fourth quarter of 2012. In June 2013, we disclosed that we had been informed that the IRS had convened an internal working group to study what constitutes “real estate” for purposes of the REIT provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and that, pending the completion of the study, the IRS was unlikely to respond definitively to our pending PLR request. In November 2013, the IRS informed us that it was actively resuming work on our PLR request and would respond in due course. We do not expect that this delay will affect the timing of our plan to elect REIT status for the taxable year beginning January 1, 2015. The Company currently expects to receive a favorable PLR from the IRS during 2014 and combined with Board approval and completion of other necessary conversion actions, we would commit to a final REIT conversion plan sometime during 2014. Once the Company reaches this commitment, the financial statements for 2014 will reflect the necessary accounting adjustments including an adjustment to eliminate the U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities balances discussed below and any tax consequences for the shareholder distributions also discussed below. We currently estimate that we will incur approximately $75.0 to $85.0 million in costs to support the REIT conversion, in addition to related tax liabilities associated with a change in our methods of depreciating and amortizing various data center assets for tax purposes from our prior methods to current methods that are more consistent with the characterization of such assets as real property for REIT purposes. The total recapture of depreciation and amortization expenses across all relevant assets is expected to result in federal and state tax liability of approximately $360.0 to $380.0 million, which amount became and is generally payable over a four-year period starting in 2012 even if we abandon the REIT conversion for any reason, including failure to obtain a favorable PLR response. Prior to the decision to convert to a REIT, our balance sheet reflected our income tax liability as a non-current deferred tax liability. As a result of the decision to convert to a REIT, our non-current tax liability has been and will continue to be gradually and proportionally reclassified from non-current to current over the four-year period, which started in the third quarter of 2012. The current liability reflects the tax liability that relates to additional taxable income expected to be recognized within the twelve-month period from the date of the balance sheet. If the REIT conversion is successful, we also expect to incur an additional $5.0 to $10.0 million in annual compliance costs in future years. We expect to pay between $145.0 to $200.0 million in cash taxes during 2014 which includes taxes on our operations and any tax impacts required by our plan to convert to a REIT. In accordance with tax rules applicable to REIT conversions, we expect to issue special distributions to our stockholders of undistributed accumulated earnings and profits of approximately $700.0 million to $1.1 billion (the “E&P distribution”), which we expect to pay out in a combination of up to 20% in cash and at least 80% in the form of our common stock. The estimated E&P distribution may change due to potential changes in certain factors impacting the calculations, such as finalization of the 2013 E&P amounts and the actual financial year 2014 performance of the entities to be included in the REIT structure. We expect to make the E&P distribution only after receiving a favorable PLR from the IRS, obtaining Board approval and completion of other necessary REIT conversion actions. The Company anticipates making an E&P distribution before 2015 with the balance distributed in 2015. In addition, following the completion of the REIT conversion, we intend to declare regular distributions to our stockholders. In connection with our contemplated REIT conversion, we expect to reassess the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our U.S. operations to be included in the REIT structure during 2014 at the point in time when it is determined that all significant actions to effect the REIT conversion have occurred and we are committed to that course of action. The reevaluation will result in de-recognizing the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our REIT’s U.S. operations excluding the deferred tax liabilities associated with the depreciation and amortization recapture. The depreciation and amortization recapture is necessary as part of our REIT conversion efforts. The de-recognition of the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our REIT’s U.S. operations will occur because the expected recovery or settlement of the related assets and liabilities will not result in deductible or taxable amounts in any post-REIT conversion periods. As a result of the de-recognition of the aforementioned deferred tax assets and liabilities of our REIT’s U.S. operations and the continuing recognition of deferred tax liabilities associated with the depreciation and amortization recapture to be taxed in 2014 and 2015, we expect to record a significant tax provision expense in 2014. As of December 31, 2013, we had a net deferred tax asset of approximately $147.1 million for our U.S. operations, which includes approximately $176.0 million of deferred tax liabilities associated with the depreciation and amortization recapture. 42 Table of Contents Results of Operations Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 include the operations of the Frankfurt Kleyer 90 carrier hotel acquisition from October 1, 2013. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 include the operations of the Dubai IBX data center acquisition from November 9, 2012, Asia Tone from July 4, 2012 and ancotel from July 3, 2012. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 include the operations of ALOG from April 25, 2011. Revision of Previously-Issued Financial Statements During the three months ended June 30, 2013, we reassessed the estimated period over which revenue related to non-recurring installation fees is recognized as a result of observed trends in customer contract lives. Non-recurring installation fees, although generally paid in a lump sum upon installation, are deferred and recognized ratably over the expected life of the installation. We undertook this review due to our determination that our customers were generally benefitting from their installations longer than originally anticipated and, therefore, the estimated period that revenue related to non-recurring installation fees is recognized was extended. This change was originally incorrectly accounted for as a change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis effective April 1, 2013. During the three months ended September 30, 2013, we determined that these longer lives should have been identified and utilized for revenue recognition purposes beginning in 2006. As a result, our installation revenues, and therefore adjusted EBITDA, were overstated by $6.2 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. This error did not impact our reported total cash flows from operating activities. We assessed the effect of the above errors, as well as that of the previously-identified immaterial errors described below, individually and in the aggregate on prior periods’ financial statements in accordance with the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 99 and 108 and, based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative factors, determined that the errors were not material to any of our prior interim and annual financial statements and, therefore, the previously-issued financial statements could continue to be relied upon and that the amendment of previously filed reports with the SEC was not required. We also determined that correction of the cumulative effect of errors of $27.2 million as of December 31, 2012 would be material to the projected 2013 consolidated financial statements and as such we revised our previously-issued consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details. We have completed the revision with this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As part of the revision we also corrected certain previously-identified immaterial errors that were either uncorrected or corrected in a period subsequent to the period in which the error originated including (i) certain recoverable taxes in Brazil that were incorrectly recorded in our statements of operations, which had the effect of overstating both revenues and cost of revenues; (ii) errors related to certain foreign currency embedded derivatives in Asia-Pacific, which have an effect on revenue; (iii) an error in our statement of cash flows related to the acquisition of Asia Tone that affects both cash flows from operating and investing activities; and (iv) errors in depreciation, stock-based compensation and property tax accruals in the U.S. Discontinued Operations We present the results of operations associated with 16 of our IBX centers that we sold in November 2012 as net income from discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations. Our results of operations have been reclassified to reflect our discontinued operations for all applicable periods presented. Unless otherwise stated, the results of operations discussed herein refer to our continuing operations. 43 Table of Contents Constant Currency Presentation Our revenues and certain operating expenses (cost of revenues, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses) from our international operations have represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues and certain operating expenses. As a result, our revenues and certain operating expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. dollar against major international currencies such as the Brazilian reais, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Chinese Yuan, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar. In order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present period-over-period percentage changes in our revenues and certain operating expenses on a constant currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, we have presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results. To present this information, our current and comparative prior period revenues and certain operating expenses from entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2012 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2013 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2013 with the year ended December 31, 2012, and average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2011 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2012 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2012 with the year ended December 31, 2011). Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2013 % 2012 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas: Recurring revenues $ 1,214,301 56 % $ 1,111,755 59 % 9 % 10 % Non-recurring revenues 50,473 3 % 40,162 2 % 26 % 26 % 1,264,774 59 % 1,151,917 61 % 10 % 11 % EMEA: Recurring revenues 492,361 23 % 400,002 21 % 23 % 22 % Non-recurring revenues 32,657 1 % 32,918 2 % (1 %) (11 %) 525,018 24 % 432,920 23 % 21 % 19 % Asia-Pacific: Recurring revenues 343,300 16 % 285,311 15 % 20 % 26 % Non-recurring revenues 19,674 1 % 17,228 1 % 14 % 17 % 362,974 17 % 302,539 16 % 20 % 26 % Total: Recurring revenues 2,049,962 95 % 1,797,068 95 % 14 % 15 % Non-recurring revenues 102,804 5 % 90,308 5 % 14 % 11 % $ 2,152,766 100 % $ 1,887,376 100 % 14 % 15 % Americas Revenues. Growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to (i) $58.6 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers and IBX data center expansions in the Chicago, Rio de Janeiro, Seattle, Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above. During the year ended December 31, 2013, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $9.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Americas revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian reais and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. We expect that our Americas revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in the recently-opened IBX data centers and additional IBX data center expansions currently taking place in the Dallas, Philadelphia, New York, Toronto and Sao Paolo metro areas, which are expected to open during 2014 and first half of 2015. Our estimates of future revenue growth also take into account expected changes in recurring revenues attributed to customer bookings, customer churn or changes or amendments to customers’ contracts. 44 Table of Contents EMEA Revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, our revenues from the United Kingdom, the largest revenue contributor in the EMEA region for the period, represented approximately 36% and 38%, respectively, of the regional revenues. Our EMEA revenue growth was due to (i) $18.5 million of incremental revenue resulting from acquisitions, (ii) $52.3 million of revenue from our recently-opened IBX data center expansions in the Frankfurt, London and Zurich metro areas and (iii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. During the year ended December 31, 2013, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $8.5 million of favorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA revenues primarily due to the generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and Swiss franc during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. We expect that our EMEA revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of the Frankfurt Kleyer 90 carrier hotel acquisition and continued growth in recently-opened IBX data centers and an additional IBX data center expansion currently taking place in the London metro area, which is expected to open during 2015. Our estimates of future revenue growth also take into account expected changes in recurring revenues attributed to customer bookings, customer churn or changes or amendments to customers’ contracts. In addition, we anticipate that a cash flow hedging program we commenced in October 2013 for our EMEA region should reduce some of our foreign currency volatility prospectively. Asia-Pacific Revenues. Our revenues from Singapore, the largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, represented approximately 36% and 37%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. Our Asia-Pacific revenue growth was due to $30.0 million of incremental revenue resulting from the Asia Tone acquisition and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. During the year ended December 31, 2013, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $17.6 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Asia-Pacific revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. We expect that our Asia-Pacific revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in these recently-opened IBX data center expansions and additional expansions currently taking place in the Hong Kong, Melbourne, Shanghai, Singapore and Sydney metro areas, which are expected to open during 2014 and 2015. Our estimates of future revenue growth also take into account expected changes in recurring revenues attributed to customer bookings, customer churn or changes or amendments to customers’ contracts. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2013 % 2012 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas $ 576,869 54 % $ 533,313 57 % 8 % 9 % EMEA 271,965 26 % 230,239 24 % 18 % 17 % Asia-Pacific 215,569 20 % 181,065 19 % 19 % 26 % Total $ 1,064,403 100 % $ 944,617 100 % 13 % 14 % 45 Table of Contents Years endedDecember 31, 2013 2012 Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues: Americas 46 % 46 % EMEA 52 % 53 % Asia-Pacific 59 % 60 % Total 49 % 50 % Americas Cost of Revenues. Our Americas cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 included $216.6 million and $197.3 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our organic IBX data center expansion activity. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in our Americas cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $9.1 million of higher utilities and repair and maintenance expense, (ii) $7.3 million of higher costs associated with certain custom services provided to our customers, (iii) $6.7 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (894 Americas cost of revenues employees as of December 31, 2013 versus 828 as of December 31, 2012), (iv) $4.7 million of higher taxes, including property taxes, and (v) $2.6 million of higher costs related to office expansion, partially offset by $9.2 million of lower rent and facility costs and a $4.8 million reversal of asset retirement obligations associated with certain leases that were amended during the year ended December 31, 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2013, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $6.4 million of favorable foreign currency impact on our Americas cost of revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian reais and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. We expect Americas cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business. EMEA Cost of Revenues. EMEA cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 included $77.9 million and $69.4 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX data center expansion activity and acquisitions. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in our EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) the impact of acquisitions, which resulted in $6.6 million of incremental cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013, (ii) $10.3 million of higher utility costs, (iii) $5.8 million of costs associated with certain custom services provided to our customers, (iv) $5.3 million of higher compensation expense and (v) $2.2 million of higher professional fees to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our EMEA cost of revenues was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2012. We expect that our EMEA cost of revenues will increase as a result of the Frankfurt Kleyer 90 carrier hotel acquisition. Overall, we expect EMEA cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 included $82.6 million and $71.8 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to both our organic IBX data center expansion activity and the Asia Tone acquisition. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $13.9 million of incremental cost of revenues resulting from the Asia Tone acquisition, (ii) $4.3 million in higher utility costs and (iii) $2.3 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (excluding the impact of the Asia Tone acquisition, 240 Asia-Pacific cost of revenues employees as of December 31, 2013 versus 192 as of December 31, 2012). During the year ended December 31, 2013, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $11.9 million of net favorable foreign currency impact on our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. We expect Asia-Pacific cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business. 46 Table of Contents Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2013 % 2012 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas $ 144,178 58 % $ 122,970 61 % 17 % 18 % EMEA 68,925 28 % 52,595 26 % 31 % 30 % Asia-Pacific 33,520 14 % 27,349 13 % 23 % 28 % Total $ 246,623 100 % $ 202,914 100 % 22 % 23 % Years endedDecember 31, 2013 2012 Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues: Americas 11 % 11 % EMEA 13 % 12 % Asia-Pacific 9 % 9 % Total 11 % 11 % Americas Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our Americas sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to (i) $17.6 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (395 Americas sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2013 versus 256 as of December 31, 2012) and (ii) $3.0 million of higher advertising and promotion costs. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Americas sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2012. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our Americas sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts. Although we anticipate that we will continue to invest in Americas sales and marketing initiatives, we believe our Americas sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues will remain at approximately current levels over the next year or two but should ultimately decrease as we continue to grow our business. EMEA Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our EMEA sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to (i) $5.7 million of additional sales and marketing expenses resulting from acquisitions and (ii) $8.8 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense and headcount growth (excluding the impact of acquisitions, 179 EMEA sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2013 versus 148 as of December 31, 2012). For the year ended December 31, 2013, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our EMEA sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2012. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our EMEA sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts and, as a result, our EMEA sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues have increased. Although we anticipate that we will continue to invest in EMEA sales and marketing initiatives, we believe our EMEA sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues will remain at approximately current levels over the next year or two but should ultimately decrease as we continue to grow our business. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $2.8 million of incremental sales and marketing expenses from the impact of the Asia Tone acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2012. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts and, as a result, our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses have increased. Although we anticipate that we will continue to invest in Asia-Pacific sales and marketing initiatives, we believe our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues will remain at approximately current levels over the next year or two but should ultimately decrease as we continue to grow our business. 47 Table of Contents General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2013 % 2012 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas $ 263,145 70 % $ 238,178 73 % 10 % 11 % EMEA 72,867 19 % 57,093 17 % 28 % 28 % Asia-Pacific 38,778 11 % 32,995 10 % 18 % 20 % Total $ 374,790 100 % $ 328,266 100 % 14 % 15 % Years endedDecember 31, 2013 2012 General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues: Americas 21 % 21 % EMEA 14 % 13 % Asia-Pacific 11 % 11 % Total 17 % 17 % Americas General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $14.4 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (695 Americas general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2013 versus 661 as of December 31, 2012), (ii) $4.1 million of higher office expansion and travel expenses and (iii) $4.0 million of higher professional fees to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Americas general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2012. Over the course of the past year, we have been investing in our Americas general and administrative functions to scale this region effectively for growth, which has included additional investments into improving our back office systems. We expect our current efforts to improve our back office systems will continue over the next several years. We are also incurring costs to support our REIT conversion process. Collectively, these investments in our back office systems and our REIT conversion process have resulted in increased professional fees. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect Americas general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to further scale our operations to support our growth, including these investments in our back office systems and the REIT conversion process. EMEA General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our EMEA general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $2.0 million of incremental general and administrative expenses resulting from acquisitions, (ii) $6.4 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (excluding the impact of acquisitions, 276 EMEA general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2013 versus 196 as of December 31, 2012) and (iii) $5.8 million of higher professional fees to support our growth. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our EMEA general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2012. Over the course of the past year, we have been investing in our EMEA general and administrative functions as a result of our ongoing efforts to scale this region effectively for growth including certain corporate reorganization activities, which has resulted in an increased level of professional fees. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect our EMEA general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth; however, as a percentage of revenues, we generally expect them to decrease. 48 Table of Contents Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. Excluding the Asia Tone acquisition, the increase in our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was primarily due to $3.5 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (208 Asia-Pacific general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2013 versus 166 as of December 31, 2012). For the year ended December 31, 2013, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2012. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth; however, as a percentage of revenues, we generally expect them to decrease. Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a $4.8 million reversal of the restructuring charge accrual for our excess space in the New York 2 IBX data center as a result of our decision to purchase this property and utilize the space. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we did not record any restructuring charges. For additional information, see “Restructuring Charges” in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Impairment Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we did not record any impairment charges. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded impairment charges totaling $9.9 million as a result of the fair values of certain long-lived assets being lower than their carrying values due to our decision to abandon two properties in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions. For additional information, see “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Acquisition Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $10.9 million primarily attributed to our Americas and EMEA regions. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $8.8 million primarily attributed to the ancotel and Asia Tone acquisitions. Interest Income. Interest income was $3.4 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2013 was 0.32% versus 0.43% for the year ended December 31, 2012. We expect our interest income to remain at these low levels for the foreseeable future due to the impact of a continued low interest rate environment and a portfolio more weighted towards short-term securities. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $248.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 from $200.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase in interest expense was primarily due to the impact of our $1.5 billion senior notes offering in March 2013, $15.6 million of higher interest expense from various capital lease and other financing obligations to support our expansion projects and less capitalized interest expense, which was partially offset by the redemption of our 8.125% senior notes in April 2013. During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we capitalized $10.6 million and $30.6 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. Going forward, we expect to incur higher interest expense as we recognize the full impact of our $1.5 billion senior notes offering, partially offset by the redemption of our 8.125% senior notes, which will contribute approximately $17.7 million in incremental interest expense annually. We may also incur additional indebtedness to support our growth, resulting in higher interest expense. Other Income (Expense). For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded $5.3 million of other income and $2.2 million of other expense for the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains (losses) during the periods. Loss on debt extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a $108.5 million loss on debt extinguishment, of which $93.6 million was attributable to the redemption of our $750.0 million 8.125% senior notes, $13.2 million was attributable to the extinguishment of the financing liabilities for our London 4 and 5 IBX data centers and $1.7 million was attributable to an amendment of our New York 5 and 6 IBX lease. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded $5.2 million of loss on debt extinguishment due to the repayment and termination of our multi-currency credit facility in the Asia-Pacific region. For additional information, see “Loss on Debt Extinguishment” in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 49 Table of Contents Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded $16.2 million of income tax expense. The income tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily attributable to our foreign operations, as we incurred losses in our domestic operations during the period as a result of the $93.6 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the redemption of our $750.0 million 8.125% senior notes. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded $58.6 million of income tax expense. The income tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily a result of applying the effective statutory tax rates to our operating income adjusted for permanent tax adjustments for the period and the assessments of valuation allowances of $5.5 million against the net deferred tax assets with certain foreign operating entities. Our effective tax rates were 14.4% and 31.0%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits from losses incurred in our domestic operations as mentioned above and the new organizational structure in EMEA which became effective on July 1, 2013. The cash taxes for 2013 were primarily for U.S. income taxes and foreign income taxes in certain European jurisdictions and the cash taxes for 2012 were primarily for state and foreign income taxes. To better align our EMEA corporate structure and intercompany relationship with the nature of our business activities and regional centralization, we commenced certain reorganization activities during the fourth quarter of 2012 in the EMEA region. The new organizational structure centralized the majority of our EMEA business management activities in the Netherlands effective July 1, 2013. In December 2013, our Dutch subsidiaries that were created to carry-out EMEA’s centralized management activities received favorable rulings from the Dutch Tax Authorities effective July 1, 2013. The rulings acknowledge the reorganization and agree to a lower level of earnings by our Dutch subsidiaries subject to tax in the Netherlands. The rulings also require both the Dutch Tax Authorities and our Dutch subsidiaries to revisit and renew the agreement in five years from the effective date. As a result, we expect our overall effective tax rate will be lower in subsequent periods as the new structure begins to take full effect. Assuming a successful conversion to a REIT, and no material changes to tax rules and regulations, we expect our effective long-term worldwide cash tax rate to ultimately decrease to a range of 10% to 15%. In connection with our contemplated REIT conversion, we expect to reassess the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our U.S. operations to be included in the REIT structure during 2014 at the point in time when it is determined that all significant actions to effect the REIT conversion have occurred and we are committed to that course of action. The reevaluation will result in de-recognizing the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our REIT’s U.S. operations excluding the deferred tax liabilities associated with the depreciation and amortization recapture. The depreciation and amortization recapture is necessary as part of our REIT conversion efforts. The de-recognition of the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our REIT’s U.S. operations will occur because the expected recovery or settlement of the related assets and liabilities will not result in deductible or taxable amounts in any post-REIT conversion periods. As a result of the de-recognition of the aforementioned deferred tax assets and liabilities of our REIT’s U.S. operations and the continuing recognition of deferred tax liabilities associated with the depreciation and amortization recapture to be taxed in 2014 and 2015, we expect to record a significant tax provision expense in 2014. As of December 31, 2013, we had a net deferred tax asset of approximately $147.1 million for our U.S. operations, which includes approximately $176.0 million of deferred tax liabilities associated with the depreciation and amortization recapture. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we utilized all of our federal net operating losses free of Section 382 limitations in the U.S. for which a deferred tax asset had been previously recognized and all of our windfall tax losses in the U.S. for which a deferred tax asset had not been previously recognized. We recorded excess income tax benefits of $25.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 in our consolidated balance sheet. Net Income from Discontinued Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we did not have any discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2012, our net income from discontinued operations was $13.1 million, consisting of $11.9 million from the gain on sale of discontinued operations, net of income tax, and $1.2 million of net income from discontinued operations. For additional information, see “Discontinued Operations” in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 50 Table of Contents Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a key factor in how we assess the performance of our segments, measure the operational cash generating abilities of our segments and develop regional growth strategies such as IBX data center expansion decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is the result of our revenues less our adjusted operating expenses. Our adjusted operating expenses exclude depreciation expense, amortization expense, accretion expense, stock-based compensation, restructuring charge, impairment charges and acquisition costs. Periodically, we enter into new lease agreements or amend existing lease agreements. To the extent we conclude that a lease is an operating lease, the rent expense may decrease our adjusted EBITDA whereas to the extent we conclude that a lease is a capital or financing lease, and this lease was previously reported as an operating lease, this outcome may increase our adjusted EBITDA. Our adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2013 % 2012 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas $ 608,718 61 % $ 557,800 63 % 9 % 10 % EMEA 216,186 22 % 183,612 21 % 18 % 13 % Asia-Pacific 175,994 17 % 146,445 16 % 20 % 26 % Total $ 1,000,898 100 % $ 887,857 100 % 13 % 13 % Americas Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our Americas adjusted EBITDA was due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above. During the year ended December 31, 2013, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $3.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Americas adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian reais and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. EMEA Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our EMEA adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to (i) additional adjusted EBITDA from the impact of acquisitions, which generated $15.2 million of incremental adjusted EBITDA and (ii) our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth, partially offset by higher adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation expense and higher professional fees to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2013, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $8.0 million of net favorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and Swiss franc during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Asia-Pacific Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to (i) additional adjusted EBITDA from the impact of the Asia Tone acquisition, which generated $14.3 million of incremental adjusted EBITDA and (ii) higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth. During the year ended December 31, 2013, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $7.8 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. 51 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 Revenues.

Growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to (i) $27.2 million of incremental revenue from ALOG ($71.2 million of full-year revenue contributions from ALOG during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $44.0 million of partial-year revenue contributions during the year ended December 31, 2011), (ii) $26.5 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers and IBX data center expansions in the Dallas, Miami, New York and Washington, D.C. metro areas and (iii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Americas revenues was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2011. EMEA Revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, our revenues from the United Kingdom, the largest revenue contributor in the EMEA region for the period, represented approximately 38% and 35%, respectively, of the regional revenues. Our EMEA revenue growth was due to (i) $11.5 million of additional revenue resulting from the ancotel acquisition, (ii) $31.8 million of revenue from our recently-opened IBX data center expansions in the Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris metro areas and (iii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. During the year ended December 31, 2012, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $22.8 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss Franc during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. Asia-Pacific Revenues. Our revenues from Singapore, the largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, represented approximately 37% and 40%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. Our Asia-Pacific revenue growth was due to (i) $23.1 million of additional revenue resulting from the Asia Tone acquisition, (ii) $9.5 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX center expansions in the Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore and Sydney metro areas and (iii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific revenues was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2011. 52 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2012 % 2011 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas $ 533,313 57 % $ 486,633 59 % 10 % 10 % EMEA 230,239 24 % 212,967 26 % 8 % 15 % Asia-Pacific 181,065 19 % 129,424 15 % 40 % 40 % Total $ 944,617 100 % $ 829,024 100 % 14 % 16 % Years endedDecember 31, 2012 2011 Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues: Americas 46 % 49 % EMEA 53 % 59 % Asia-Pacific 60 % 59 % Total 50 % 53 % Americas Cost of Revenues. Our Americas cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 included $197.3 million and $178.9 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to both our organic IBX data center expansion activity and acquisitions. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in our Americas cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $9.4 million of incremental Americas cost of revenues resulting from the ALOG acquisition, (ii) $7.0 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation cost, (iii) $5.9 million of higher costs associated with certain revenues from offerings provided to customers and (iv) $4.6 million of higher property taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Americas cost of revenues was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2011. EMEA Cost of Revenues. EMEA cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 included $69.4 million and $67.0 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to both our organic IBX data center expansion activity and acquisitions. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $4.4 million of additional cost of revenues resulting from the ancotel acquisition, (ii) an increase of $6.5 million in utility costs arising from increased customer installations and revenues attributed to customer growth and (iii) $3.2 million of higher costs associated with costs of equipment sales. During the year ended December 31, 2012, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $13.7 million of net favorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA cost of revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss franc during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 included $71.8 million and $46.7 million, respectively, of depreciation expense.

EMEA General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our EMEA general and administrative expenses was primarily due to $3.2 million of additional general and administrative expenses resulting from the ancotel acquisition and (ii) $5.9 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (excluding the impact of the ancotel acquisition, 196 EMEA general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2012 versus 180 as of December 31, 2011), partially offset by $3.7 million of lower professional fees. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our EMEA general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2011. Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses.

Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we did not record any restructuring charges. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $3.5 million primarily related to revised sublease assumptions on our excess leased space in the New York metro area. For additional information, see “Restructuring Charges” in Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 55 Table of Contents Impairment Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded impairment charges totaling $9.9 million as a result of the fair values of certain long-lived assets being lower than their carrying values due to our decision to abandon two properties in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions. For additional information, see “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the year ended December 31, 2011, no impairment charges were recorded. Acquisition Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $8.8 million primarily attributed to the ancotel and Asia Tone acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $3.3 million primarily related to the ALOG acquisition. Interest Income. Interest income increased to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 from $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Interest income increased primarily due to higher yields on invested balances. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2012 was 0.43% versus 0.33% for the year ended December 31, 2011. We expect our interest income to remain at these low levels for the foreseeable future due to the impact of a continued low interest rate environment and a portfolio more weighted towards short-term securities. Interest Expense. During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, we recorded interest expense of $200.3 million and $181.3 million, respectively. This increase was primarily due to the impact of our $750.0 million 7.00% senior notes offering in July 2011, which resulted in an approximately $28.6 million increase in interest expense, and additional financings such as various capital lease and other financing obligations to support our expansion projects. This increase was partially offset by our settlement of the $250.0 million 2.50% convertible subordinated notes in April 2012, which resulted in an approximately $13.7 million decrease in interest expense. During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, we capitalized $30.6 million and $13.6 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. Other Income (Expense). For the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded $2.2 million of other expense compared to $2.8 million of other income for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains (losses) during the periods. Loss on debt extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded $5.2 million of loss on debt extinguishment due to the repayment and termination of our multi-currency credit facility in the Asia-Pacific region. During the year ended December 31, 2011, no loss on debt extinguishment was recorded. Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded $58.6 million of income tax expense. The income tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily a result of applying the effective statutory tax rates to our operating income adjusted for permanent tax adjustments for the period and the assessments of valuation allowances of $5.5 million against the net deferred tax assets with certain foreign operating entities. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded $37.3 million of income tax expense. The income tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily a result of applying the effective statutory tax rates to our operating income adjusted for permanent tax adjustments for the period, partially offset by an income tax benefit due to the release of a valuation allowance of $2.5 million associated with certain foreign operating entities. Our effective tax rates were 31.0% and 28.8%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. The cash taxes for 2012 and 2011 were primarily for state and foreign income taxes. In connection with the planned REIT Conversion, we changed our methods of depreciating and amortizing various data center assets for tax purposes to methods more consistent with the characterization of such assets as real property for REIT purposes. As a result of this decision, we reclassified $89.2 million of non-current deferred tax liabilities to current deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2012 associated with taxes that were expected to be paid in the next 12 months. The change in depreciation and amortization method also increased our taxable income for 2012, resulting in an acceleration of the usage of our operating and windfall employee equity award net operating loss carryforwards. As a result of the tax depreciation method change, the taxable gain recognized in the divestiture and the level of operating profits, we utilized most of our net operating losses in the U.S. for which a deferred tax asset had been previously recognized and all of our windfall tax losses in the U.S. for which a deferred tax asset had not been previously recognized. We recorded excess income tax benefits of $84.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 in our consolidated balance sheet. 56 Table of Contents Net Income from Discontinued Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2012, our net income from discontinued operations was $13.1 million, consisting of $11.9 million from the gain on sale of discontinued operations, net of income tax, and $1.2 million of net income from discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our net income from discontinued operations was $1.0 million. For additional information, see “Discontinued Operations” in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a key factor in how we assess the performance of our segments, measure the operational cash generating abilities of our segments and develop regional growth strategies such as IBX data center expansion decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is the result of our revenues less our adjusted operating expenses. Our adjusted operating expenses exclude depreciation expense, amortization expense, accretion expense, stock-based compensation, restructuring charge, impairment charges and acquisition costs. Periodically, we enter into new lease agreements or amend existing lease agreements. To the extent we conclude that a lease is an operating lease, the rent expense may decrease our adjusted EBITDA whereas to the extent we conclude that a lease is a capital or financing lease, and this lease was previously reported as an operating lease, this outcome may increase our adjusted EBITDA. Our adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2012 % 2011 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas $ 557,800 62 % $ 477,527 66 % 17 % 17 % EMEA 183,612 21 % 143,093 20 % 28 % 35 % Asia-Pacific 146,445 17 % 100,884 14 % 45 % 45 % Total $ 887,857 100 % $ 721,504 100 % 23 % 24 % Americas Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our Americas adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to (i) incremental adjusted EBITDA from the impact of the ALOG acquisition, which generated $13.0 million of adjusted EBITDA, and (ii) higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Americas adjusted EBITDA was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2011. EMEA Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our EMEA adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to (i) additional adjusted EBITDA from the impact of the ancotel acquisition, which generated $2.4 million of adjusted EBITDA, (ii) higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above and (iii) lower adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily attributable to lower rent and facility costs and utility costs. During the year ended December 31, 2012, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $10.2 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA adjusted EBITDA primarily due to generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss franc during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. Asia-Pacific Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to (i) additional adjusted EBITDA from the impact of the Asia Tone acquisition, which generated $12.0 million of adjusted EBITDA, (ii) higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above and (iii) lower adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily attributable to lower rent and facility costs. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2011. 57 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures We provide all information required in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but we believe that evaluating our ongoing operating results from continuing operations may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, we use non-GAAP financial measures, primarily adjusted EBITDA, to evaluate our continuing operations. We also use adjusted EBITDA as a metric in the determination of employees’ annual bonuses and vesting of restricted stock units that have both a service and performance condition. In presenting adjusted EBITDA, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future operating performance. These items are depreciation, amortization, accretion of asset retirement obligations and accrued restructuring charges, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges and acquisition costs. Legislative and regulatory requirements encourage the use of and emphasis on GAAP financial metrics and require companies to explain why non-GAAP financial metrics are relevant to management and investors. We exclude these items in order for our lenders, investors, and industry analysts, who review and report on us, to better evaluate our operating performance and cash spending levels relative to our industry sector and competitors. For example, we exclude depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of our IBX data centers and do not reflect our current or future cash spending levels to support our business. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of our IBX data centers do not recur and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to our initial investment. This is a trend we expect to continue. In addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of our IBX data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs incurred to build out our IBX data centers, and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. Therefore, we exclude depreciation from our operating results when evaluating our continuing operations. In addition, in presenting the non-GAAP financial measures, we exclude amortization expense related to certain intangible assets, as it represents a cost that may not recur and is not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance. We exclude accretion expense, both as it relates to asset retirement obligations as well as accrued restructuring charge liabilities, as these expenses represent costs which we believe are not meaningful in evaluating our current operations. We exclude stock-based compensation expense as it primarily represents expense attributed to equity awards that have no current or future cash obligations. As such, we, and many investors and analysts, exclude this stock-based compensation expense when assessing the cash generating performance of our continuing operations. We also exclude restructuring charges from our non-GAAP financial measures. The restructuring charges relate to our decisions to exit leases for excess space adjacent to several of our IBX data centers, which we did not intend to build out, or our decision to reverse such restructuring charges. We also exclude impairment charges related to certain long-lived assets. The impairment charges are related to expense recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets are not recoverable. Finally, we exclude acquisition costs from our non-GAAP financial measures. The acquisition costs relate to costs we incur in connection with business combinations. Management believes such items as restructuring charges, impairment charges and acquisition costs are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs will or may occur in future periods. Our management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. However, we have presented such non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. We believe that the inclusion of this non-GAAP financial measure provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and its ability to perform in subsequent periods. We believe that if we did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze Equinix effectively. Investors should note, however, that the non-GAAP financial measures used by us may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. In addition, whenever we use non-GAAP financial measures, we provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 58 Table of Contents We define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges and acquisition costs as presented below (in thousands): Years ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Income from continuing operations $ 460,932 $ 392,896 $ 305,922 Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense 431,008 393,543 337,667 Stock-based compensation expense 102,940 82,735 71,137 Restructuring charges (4,837 ) — 3,481 Impairment charges — 9,861 — Acquisition costs 10,855 8,822 3,297 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,000,898 $ 887,857 $ 721,504 Our adjusted EBITDA results have improved each year and in each region in total dollars due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in “Results of Operations”, as well as the nature of our business model consisting of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature also discussed earlier in “Overview”. Although we have also been investing in our future growth as described above (e.g. through additional IBX data center expansions, acquisitions and increased investments in sales and marketing), we believe that our adjusted EBITDA results will continue to improve in future periods as we continue to grow our business. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2013, our total indebtedness was comprised of (i) convertible debt principal totaling $769.7 million from our 3.00% convertible subordinated notes and our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes (gross of discount) and (ii) non-convertible debt and financing obligations totaling $3.4 billion consisting of (a) $2.3 billion of principal from our 7.00%, 5.375% and 4.875% senior notes, (b) $253.2 million of principal from our mortgage and loans payable and (c) $931.2 million from our capital lease and other financing obligations. We believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of the current portion of our debt as it becomes due, payment of tax liabilities related to the decision to convert to a REIT (see below) and completion of our publicly-announced expansion projects. As of December 31, 2013, we had $1.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, of which approximately $833.8 million was held in the U.S. We believe that our current expansion activities in the U.S. can be funded with our U.S.-based cash and cash equivalents and investments. Besides our investment portfolio, additional liquidity available to us from the $550.0 million revolving credit facility that forms part of our $750.0 million credit facility, referred to as the U.S. financing, any further financing activities we may pursue, and customer collections are our primary source of cash. While we believe we have a strong customer base and have continued to experience relatively strong collections, if the current market conditions were to deteriorate, some of our customers may have difficulty paying us and we may experience increased churn in our customer base, including reductions in their commitments to us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. As of December 31, 2013, we had 17 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $33.2 million issued and outstanding under the U.S. revolving credit line; as a result, we had a total of approximately $516.8 million of additional liquidity available to us under the U.S. revolving credit line. While we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our current operating requirements and to complete our publicly-announced IBX data center expansion plans, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build out of new IBX data centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as potential acquisitions, and have also announced our planned conversion to a REIT (see below). While we expect to fund these plans with our existing resources, additional financing, either debt or equity, may be required to pursue certain new or unannounced additional plans, including acquisitions. However, if current market conditions were to deteriorate, we may be unable to secure additional financing or any such additional financing may only be available to us on unfavorable terms. An inability to pursue additional expansion opportunities will have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our desired level of revenue growth in future periods. 59 Table of Contents In October 2013, we initiated a program to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for forecasted revenues and expenses in our EMEA region in order to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the British Pound, Euro and Swiss Franc. The foreign currency forward contracts that we use to hedge this exposure are designated as cash flow hedges. For additional information, see “Derivatives and Hedging Instruments” in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Impact of REIT Conversion We currently estimate that we will incur approximately $75.0 to $85.0 million in costs to support the REIT conversion, in addition to related tax liabilities associated with a change in our methods of depreciating and amortizing various data center assets for tax purposes from our prior methods to current methods that are more consistent with the characterization of such assets as real property for REIT purposes. The total recapture of depreciation and amortization expenses across all relevant assets is expected to result in federal and state tax liability of approximately $360.0 to $380.0 million, which amount became and is generally payable over a four-year period starting in 2012 even if we abandon the REIT conversion for any reason, including failure to obtain a favorable PLR response. Prior to the decision to convert to a REIT, our balance sheet reflected our income tax liability as a non-current deferred tax liability. As a result of the decision to convert to a REIT, our non-current tax liability has been and will continue to be gradually and proportionally reclassified from non-current to current over the four-year period, which started in the third quarter of 2012. The current liability reflects the tax liability that relates to additional taxable income expected to be recognized within the twelve-month period from the date of the balance sheet. If the REIT conversion is successful, we also expect to incur an additional $5.0 to $10.0 million in annual compliance costs in future years. We expect to pay between $145.0 to $200.0 million in cash taxes during 2014 which includes taxes on our operations and any tax impacts required by our plan to convert to a REIT. In accordance with tax rules applicable to REIT conversions, we expect to issue special distributions to our stockholders of undistributed accumulated earnings and profits of approximately $700.0 million to $1.1 billion (the “E&P distribution”), which we expect to pay out in a combination of up to 20% in cash and at least 80% in the form of our common stock. The estimated E&P distribution may change due to potential changes in certain factors impacting the calculations, such as finalization of the 2013 E&P amounts and the actual financial year 2014 performance of the entities to be included in the REIT structure. We expect to make the E&P distribution only after receiving a favorable PLR from the IRS, obtaining Board approval and completion of other necessary REIT conversion actions. The Company anticipates making an E&P distribution before 2015 with the balance distributed in 2015. In addition, following the completion of the REIT conversion, we intend to declare regular distributions to our stockholders. Sources and Uses of Cash Years ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 604,608 $ 632,026 $ 587,320 Net cash used in investing activities (1,169,313 ) (442,873 ) (1,499,155 ) Net cash provided (used in) by financing activities 574,907 (222,721 ) 748,728 Operating Activities The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily attributed to unfavorable working capital activities, such as $87.0 million and $25.3 million, respectively, of higher payments of income taxes and interest expense in 2013, partially offset by improved operating results. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to improved operating results, partially offset by unfavorable working capital activities, such as increased payments of income taxes. Although our collections remain strong, it is possible for some large customer receivables that were anticipated to be collected in one quarter to slip to the next quarter. For example, some large customer receivables that were anticipated to be collected in December 2013 were instead collected in January 2014, which negatively impacted cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013. We expect that we will continue to generate cash from our operating activities throughout 2014 and beyond; however, we expect to pay an increased amount of income taxes until such time that we become a REIT, which will negatively impact the cash we generate from operating activities. 60 Table of Contents Investing Activities The increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to $526.1 million of higher purchases of investments and $452.3 million of lower sales and maturities of investments, partially offset by $192.1 million of lower capital expenditures as a result of less expansion activity and $260.2 million of lower business acquisition spending. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities during 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to $825.7 million of lower purchases of investments, $320.6 million of higher sales and maturities of investments and $76.5 million of proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations, partially offset by $267.5 million of higher business acquisition spending and $79.1 million of higher capital expenditures. During 2014, we expect that our IBX expansion construction activity will be similar to our 2013 levels. However, if the opportunity to expand is greater than planned and we have sufficient funding to pursue such expansion opportunities, we may increase the level of capital expenditures to support this growth as well as pursue additional business acquisitions, property acquisitions or joint ventures. Financing Activities The net cash provided by financing activities for 2013 was primarily due to $1.5 billion of proceeds from the senior notes offering in March 2013, partially offset by $834.7 million for the redemption of the $750.0 million 8.125% senior notes, repayments of various debt and purchases of treasury stock. The net cash used in financing activities for 2012 was primarily due to the repayment of our multi-currency credit facility in the Asia-Pacific region and the settlement of the $250.0 million 2.50% convertible subordinated notes, partially offset by proceeds from the U.S. financing and the ALOG financings. The net cash provided by financing activities for 2011 was primarily due to our $750.0 million 7.00% senior notes offering in July 2011, partially offset by purchases of treasury stock and repayments of various debt. Going forward, we expect that our financing activities will consist primarily of repayment of our debt and additional financings needed to support expansion opportunities, additional acquisitions or joint ventures, or our conversion to a REIT. Debt Obligations – Convertible Debt 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes. In June 2009, we issued $373.8 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% convertible subordinated notes due June 15, 2016. Interest is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year and commenced on December 15, 2009. The initial conversion rate is 11.8599 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. This represents an initial conversion price of approximately $84.32 per share of common stock. Upon conversion, holders will receive, at our election, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. Holders of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes were eligible to convert their notes during the year ended December 31, 2013 and are eligible to convert their notes during the three months ending March 31, 2014, since the stock price condition conversion clause was met during the applicable periods. As of December 31, 2013, had the holders of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes converted their notes, the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes would have been convertible into a maximum of 4.4 million shares of our common stock. Upon conversion, if we elected to pay a sufficiently large portion of the conversion obligation in cash, additional consideration beyond the $373.8 million of gross proceeds received would be required. However, to minimize the impact of potential dilution upon conversion of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, we entered into capped call transactions, which are referred to as the capped call, separate from the issuance of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, for which we paid a premium of $49.7 million. The capped call covers a total of approximately 4.4 million shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment. Under the capped call, we effectively raised the conversion price of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes from $84.32 to $114.82. Depending upon our stock price at the time the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes are converted, the capped call will return up to 1.2 million shares of our common stock to us; however, we will receive no benefit from the capped call if our stock price is $84.32 or lower at the time of conversion and will receive less shares for share prices in excess of $114.82 at the time of conversion than we would have received at a share price of $114.82 (our benefit from the capped call is capped at $114.82, and no additional benefit is received beyond this price). 61 Table of Contents We do not have the right to redeem the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes at our option. We separately accounted for the liability and equity components of our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes in accordance with the accounting standard for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement). For additional information, see “4.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes” in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 3.00% Convertible Subordinated Notes. In September 2007, we issued $396.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Convertible Subordinated Notes due October 15, 2014. Interest is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year and commenced in April 2008. Holders of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes may convert their notes at their option on any day up to and including the business day immediately preceding the maturity date into shares of our common stock. We do not have the right to redeem the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes at our option. The base conversion rate is 7.436 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. This represents a base conversion price of approximately $134.48 per share of common stock. If, at the time of conversion, the applicable stock price of our common stock exceeds the base conversion price, the conversion rate will be determined pursuant to a formula resulting in the receipt of up to 4.4616 additional shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, subject to adjustment. However, in no event would the total number of shares issuable upon conversion of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes exceed 11.8976 per $1,000 principal amount of 3.00% convertible subordinated notes, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, or the equivalent of $84.05 per share of our common stock or a total of 4.7 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2013, we expect the holders of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes to convert their notes into shares of our common stock prior to the notes’ maturity date and the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes were convertible into 3.4 million shares of our common stock. Debt Obligations – Non-Convertible Debt Senior Notes 4.875% Senior Notes and 5.375% Senior Notes. In March 2013, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, which consist of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due April 1, 2020 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due April 1, 2023. Interest on both the 4.875% senior notes and the 5.375% senior notes is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year and commenced on October 1, 2013. The 4.875% senior notes and the 5.375% senior notes are governed by separate indentures dated March 5, 2013, which are referred to as the senior notes indentures, between us, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Senior Notes Indentures”). The senior notes indentures contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things: • incur additional debt; • pay dividends or make other restricted payments; • purchase, redeem or retire capital stock or subordinated debt; • make asset sales; • enter into transactions with affiliates; • incur liens; • enter into sale-leaseback transactions; • provide subsidiary guarantees; • make investments; and • merge or consolidate with any other person. 62 Table of Contents Each of these restrictions has a number of important qualifications and exceptions. The 4.875% senior notes and the 5.375% senior notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment with our existing or future senior debt and senior in right of payment to our existing and future subordinated debt. The 4.875% senior notes and the 5.375% senior notes are effectively junior to our secured indebtedness and indebtedness of our subsidiaries. At any time prior to April 1, 2016, we may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 4.875% senior notes outstanding at a redemption price equal to 104.875% of the principal amount of the 4.875% senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings; provided that (i) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the 4.875% senior notes issued under the 4.875% senior notes indenture remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption (excluding the 4.875% senior notes held by us and our subsidiaries); and (ii) the redemption must occur within 90 days of the date of the closing of such equity offering. On or after April 1, 2017, we may redeem all or a part of the 4.875% senior notes, on any one or more occasions, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on April 1 of the years indicated below: Redemption price of the 4.875% Senior Notes 2017 102.438 % 2018 101.219 % 2019 and thereafter 100.000 % At any time prior to April 1, 2017, we may also redeem all or a part of the 4.875% senior notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 4.875% senior notes redeemed plus an applicable premium, which is referred to as the 4.875% senior notes applicable premium, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption, which is referred to as the 4.875% senior notes redemption date. The 4.875% senior notes applicable premium means the greater of: • 1.0% of the principal amount of the 4.875% senior notes; and • the excess of: (a) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the redemption price of the 4.875% senior notes at April 1, 2017 as shown in the above table, plus (ii) all required interest payments due on the 4.875% senior notes through April 1, 2017 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including the 4.875% senior notes redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the yield to maturity of the U.S. Treasury securities with a constant maturity most nearly equal to the period from the 4.875% senior notes redemption date to April 1, 2017, plus 0.50%; over (b) the principal amount of the 4.875% senior notes. At any time prior to April 1, 2016, we may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 5.375% senior notes outstanding at a redemption price equal to 105.375% of the principal amount of the 5.375% senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings; provided that (i) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the 5.375% senior notes issued under the 5.375% senior notes indenture remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption (excluding the 5.375% senior notes held by us and our subsidiaries); and (ii) the redemption must occur within 90 days of the date of the closing of such equity offering. 63 Table of Contents On or after April 1, 2018, we may redeem all or a part of the 5.375% senior notes, on any one or more occasions, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on April 1 of the years indicated below: Redemption price of the 5.375% Senior Notes 2018 102.688 % 2019 101.792 % 2020 100.896 % 2021 and thereafter 100.000 % At any time prior to April 1, 2018, we may also redeem all or a part of the 5.375% senior notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 5.375% senior notes redeemed plus an applicable premium, which is referred to as the 5.375% senior notes applicable premium, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption, which is referred to as the 5.375% senior notes redemption date. The 5.375% senior notes applicable premium means the greater of: • 1.0% of the principal amount of the 5.375% senior notes; and • the excess of: (a) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the redemption price of the 5.375% senior notes at April 1, 2018 as shown in the above table, plus (ii) all required interest payments due on the 5.375% senior notes through April 1, 2018 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including the 5.375% senior notes redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the yield to maturity of the U.S. Treasury securities with a constant maturity most nearly equal to the period from the 5.375% senior notes redemption date to April 1, 2018, plus 0.50%; over (b) the principal amount of the 5.375% senior notes. Debt issuance costs related to the 4.875% senior notes and 5.375% senior notes, net of amortization, were $18.5 million as of December 31, 2013. 7.00% Senior Notes. In July 2011, we issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.00% senior notes due July 15, 2021, which are referred to as the 7.00% senior notes. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year and commenced on January 15, 2012. The 7.00% senior notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to our existing or future senior debt and senior in right of payment to our existing and future subordinated debt. The 7.00% senior notes are effectively junior to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries. The 7.00% senior notes are also structurally subordinated to all debt and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries and will continue to be subordinated to the extent that these subsidiaries do not guarantee the 7.00% senior notes in the future. The 7.00% Senior Notes are governed by an indenture which contains covenants that limit the Company’s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to, among other things: • incur additional debt; • pay dividends or make other restricted payments; • purchase, redeem or retire capital stock or subordinated debt; • make asset sales; • enter into transactions with affiliates; • incur liens; • enter into sale-leaseback transactions; • provide subsidiary guarantees; • make investments; and • merge or consolidate with any other person. 64 Table of Contents At any time prior to July 15, 2014, we may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 7.00% senior notes outstanding at a redemption price equal to 107.000% of the principal amount of the 7.00% senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings, provided that (i) at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the 7.00% senior notes issued remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption and (ii) the redemption must occur within 90 days of the date of the closing of such equity offerings. On or after July 15, 2016, we may redeem all or a part of the 7.00% senior notes, on any one or more occasions, at the redemption prices set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, up to, but not including, the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on July 15 of the years indicated below: Redemption price of the Senior Notes 2016 103.500 % 2017 102.333 % 2018 101.167 % 2019 and thereafter 100.000 % In addition, at any time prior to July 15, 2016, we may also redeem all or a part of the 7.00% senior notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 7.00% senior notes redeemed plus a premium, which is referred to as the applicable premium, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption, which is referred to as the redemption date. The applicable premium means the greater of: • 1.0% of the principal amount of the 7.00% senior notes to be redeemed; and • the excess of: (a) the present value at such redemption date of (i) the redemption price of the 7.00% senior notes to be redeemed at July 15, 2016 as shown in the above table, plus (ii) all required interest payments due on these 7.00% senior notes through July 15, 2016 (excluding accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including the redemption date), computed using a discount rate equal to the yield to maturity as of the redemption date of the U.S. Treasury securities with a constant maturity most nearly equal to the period from the redemption date to July 15, 2016, plus 0.50%; over (b) the principal amount of the 7.00% senior notes to be redeemed. Upon a change in control, we will be required to make an offer to purchase each holder’s 7.00% senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. Debt issuance costs related to the 7.00% senior notes, net of amortization, were $10.7 million as of December 31, 2013. 8.125% Senior Notes. In February 2010, we issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% senior notes due March 1, 2018. The indenture governing the 8.125% senior notes permitted us to redeem the 8.125% senior notes at the redemption prices set forth in the 8.125% senior notes indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including the redemption date. In April 2013, we redeemed all of the 8.125% senior notes and incurred a loss on debt extinguishment. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 65 Table of Contents Loans Payable U.S. Financing. In June 2012, we entered into a credit agreement with a group of lenders for a $750.0 million credit facility, referred to as the U.S. financing, comprised of a $200.0 million term loan facility, referred to as the U.S. term loan, and a $550.0 million multicurrency revolving credit facility, referred to as the U.S. revolving credit line. The U.S. financing contains several financial covenants with which we must comply on a quarterly basis, including a maximum senior leverage ratio covenant, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant and a minimum tangible net worth covenant. The U.S. financing is guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries and is secured by our and the guarantors’ accounts receivable as well as pledges of the equity interests of certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries. The U.S. term loan and U.S. revolving credit line both have a five-year term, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions with respect to our outstanding convertible subordinated notes. We are required to repay the principal balance of the U.S. term loan in equal quarterly installments over the term. The U.S. term loan bears interest at a rate based on LIBOR or, at our option, the base rate, which is defined as the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (b) the Bank of America prime rate and (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus, in either case, a margin that varies as a function of our senior leverage ratio in the range of 1.25%-2.00% per annum if we elect to use the LIBOR index and in the range of 0.25%-1.00% per annum if we elect to use the base rate index. In July 2012, we fully utilized the U.S. term loan and used the funds to prepay the outstanding balance of and terminate a multi-currency credit facility in our Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. revolving credit line allows us to borrow, repay and reborrow over the term. The U.S. revolving credit line provides a sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit of up to $150.0 million at any one time. We may use the U.S. revolving credit line for working capital, capital expenditures, issuance of letters of credit, and other general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the U.S. revolving credit line bear interest at a rate based on LIBOR or, at our option, the base rate, as defined above, plus, in either case, a margin that varies as a function of our senior leverage ratio in the range of 0.95%-1.60% per annum if we elect to use the LIBOR index and in the range of 0.00%-0.60% per annum if we elect to use the base rate index. We are required to pay a quarterly letter of credit fee on the face amount of each letter of credit, which fee is based on the same margin that applies from time to time to LIBOR-indexed borrowings under the U.S. revolving credit line. We are also required to pay a quarterly facility fee ranging from 0.30%-0.40% per annum of the U.S. revolving credit line, regardless of the amount utilized, which fee also varies as a function of our senior leverage ratio. In February 2013, the U.S. financing was amended to modify certain definitions of items used in the calculation of the financial covenants with which we must comply on a quarterly basis to exclude the write-off of any unamortized debt issuance costs that were incurred in connection with the issuance of the 8.125% senior notes; to exclude one-time transaction costs, fees, premiums and expenses incurred by us in connection with the issuance of the 4.875% senior notes and 5.375% senior notes and the redemption of the 8.125% senior notes; and to exclude the 8.125% senior notes from the calculation of total leverage for the period ended March 31, 2013, provided that certain conditions in connection with the redemption of the 8.125% senior notes were satisfied. The amendment also postponed the step-down of the maximum senior leverage ratio covenant from the three months ended March 31, 2013 to the three months ended September 30, 2013. In September 2013, the U.S. financing was further amended. Among other changes, the amendment (i) modified certain covenants to accommodate our planned conversion to a REIT, and related matters; (ii) replaced the maximum senior leverage ratio covenant with a maximum senior net leverage ratio covenant and modified the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and tangible net worth covenants; (iii) modified certain defined terms used in the calculation of the financial covenants to exclude certain expenses incurred by us in connection with our planned REIT conversion; and (iv) permits us to request an increase to the U.S. revolving credit line of up to an additional $250.0 million, subject to various conditions including the receipt of lender commitments. As of December 31, 2013, we had $140.0 million outstanding under the U.S. term loan with an effective interest rate of 2.17% per annum. As of December 31, 2013, we had 17 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $33.2 million issued and outstanding under the U.S. Revolving Credit Line. As a result, the amount available to us to borrow under the U.S. revolving credit line was $516.8 million as of December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with all covenants of the U.S. financing. Debt issuance costs related to the U.S. financing, net of amortization, were $8.0 million as of December 31, 2013. 66 Table of Contents ALOG Financings. In June 2012, ALOG completed a 100.0 million Brazilian real borrowing agreement, or approximately $48.8 million, referred to as the 2012 ALOG financing. The 2012 ALOG financing has a five-year term with semi-annual principal payments beginning in the third year of its term and quarterly interest payments during the entire term. The 2012 ALOG financing bears an interest rate of 2.75% above the local borrowing rate. The 2012 ALOG financing contains financial covenants, which ALOG must comply with annually, consisting of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the 2012 ALOG financing. The 2012 ALOG financing is not guaranteed by ALOG or us. The 2012 ALOG financing is not secured by ALOG’s or our assets. The 2012 ALOG financing has a final maturity date of June 2017. In September 2012, ALOG fully utilized the 2012 ALOG financing and used a portion of the funds to prepay and terminate ALOG loans payable outstanding. As of December 31, 2013, the effective interest rate under the 2012 ALOG financing was 12.52% per annum. In November 2013, ALOG completed a 60.3 million Brazilian real borrowing agreement, or approximately $25.5 million, referred to as the 2013 ALOG financing. The 2013 ALOG financing has a five-year term with semi-annual principal payments beginning in the third year of its term and semi-annual interest payments during the entire term. The 2013 ALOG Financing bears an interest rate of 2.25% above the local borrowing rate. The 2013 ALOG Financing contains financial covenants, which ALOG must comply with annually, consisting of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the 2013 ALOG financing. The 2013 ALOG financing is not guaranteed by ALOG or us. The 2013 ALOG financing is not secured by ALOG’s or our assets. The 2013 ALOG financing has a final maturity date of November 2018. During the three months ended December 31, 2013, ALOG fully utilized the 2013 ALOG financing. As of December 31, 2013, the effective interest rate under the 2013 ALOG financing was 12.24% per annum. Capital Lease and Other Financing Obligations We have numerous capital lease and other financing obligations with maturity dates ranging from 2015 to 2053 under which a total principal balance of $931.2 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2013 with a weighted average effective interest rate of 7.89%.

As of December 31, 2013, had the holders of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes due 2014 converted their notes, the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes would have been convertible into approximately 3.4 million shares of our common stock, which would have a total value of $598.1 million based on the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, had the holders of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes due 2016 converted their notes, the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes would have been convertible into approximately 4.4 million shares of our common stock, which would have a total value of $786.5 million based on the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2013. (2) Represents principal only. (3) Represents total payments to be made under two agreements to purchase and develop the Paris 4 IBX center. (4) Represents interest on ALOG financings, convertible debt, mortgage payable, senior notes and U.S. term loan based on their approximate interest rates as of December 31, 2013. (5) Represents principal and interest. (6) Represents minimum operating lease payments, excluding potential lease renewals. (7) Represents unaccrued contractual commitments. Other contractual commitments are described below. (8) Represents liability, net of future accretion expense. (9) Represents unaccrued ALOG acquisition contingent consideration, subject to reduction for any post-closing balance sheet adjustments and any claims for indemnification, and includes the portion of the contingent consideration that will be funded by Riverwood Capital L.P., who has an indirect, non-controlling equity interest in ALOG. As of December 31, 2013, we accrued approximately $419 of ALOG acquisition contingent consideration. In connection with certain of our leases and other contracts requiring deposits, we entered into 17 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $33.2 million under the senior revolving credit line. These letters of credit were provided in lieu of cash deposits under the senior revolving credit line. If the landlords for these IBX leases decide to draw down on these letters of credit triggered by an event of default under the lease, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowing under the senior revolving credit line. These contingent commitments are not reflected in the table above. We had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaling approximately $27.1 million as of December 31, 2013. These liabilities, which are reflected on our balance sheet, are not reflected in the table above since it is unclear when these liabilities will be paid. Primarily as a result of our various IBX data center expansion projects, as of December 31, 2013, we were contractually committed for $155.1 million of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for IBX equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided in connection with the work necessary to complete construction and open these IBX data centers prior to making them available to customers for installation. This amount, which is expected to be paid during 2014 and thereafter, is reflected in the table above as “other contractual commitments.” 68 Table of Contents We had other non-capital purchase commitments in place as of December 31, 2013, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods or services to be delivered or provided during 2014 and beyond. Such other purchase commitments as of December 31, 2013, which total $189.8 million, are also reflected in the table above as “other contractual commitments.” In addition, although we are not contractually obligated to do so, we expect to incur additional capital expenditures of approximately $230 million to $270 million, in addition to the $155.1 million in contractual commitments discussed above as of December 31, 2013, in our various IBX data center expansion projects during 2014 and thereafter in order to complete the work needed to open these IBX data centers. These non-contractual capital expenditures are not reflected in the table above. If we so choose, whether due to economic factors or other considerations, we could delay these non-contractual capital expenditure commitments to preserve liquidity. Other Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements We have various guarantor arrangements with both our directors and officers and third parties, including customers, vendors and business partners. As of December 31, 2013, there were no significant liabilities recorded for these arrangements. For additional information, see “Guarantor Arrangements” in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates, among others, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require significant judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain: • Accounting for income taxes; • Accounting for business combinations; • Accounting for impairment of goodwill; and • Accounting for property, plant and equipment. 69 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid. The accounting standard for income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined by the accounting standard as a likelihood of more than 50%) such assets will not be realized. A tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authority’s widely understood administrative practices and precedents. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future events. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. If, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account a number of types of evidence, including the following: 1) the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, 2) sources of future taxable income and 3) tax planning strategies. In assessing the tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position, the tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we recorded a total of net deferred tax assets of $95.6 million and net deferred tax liabilities of $30.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had a total valuation allowance of $31.1 million and $44.9 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we decided to provide a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets associated with certain foreign operating entities, which resulted in an insignificant income tax expense in our results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we decided to provide a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets associated with certain foreign operating entities which resulted in an income tax expense of $5.5 million in our results of operations. Our decisions to release our valuation allowances were based on our belief that the operations of these jurisdictions had achieved a sufficient level of profitability and will sustain a sufficient level of profitability in the future to support the release of these valuation allowances based on relevant facts and circumstances. However, if our assumptions on the future performance of these jurisdictions prove not to be correct and these jurisdictions are not able to sustain a sufficient level of profitability to support the associated deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet, we will have to impair our deferred tax assets through an additional valuation allowance, which would impact our financial position and results of operations in the period such a determination is made. Our remaining valuation allowances as of December 31, 2013 was $31.1 million and primarily relates to certain of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. If and when we release our remaining valuation allowances, it will have a favorable impact to our financial position and results of operations in the periods such determinations are made. We will continue to assess the need for our valuation allowances, by country or location, in the future. 70 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $36.6 million and $25.0 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the unrecognized tax benefits increased by $11.6 million primarily due to losses of certain foreign operating entities, which more likely than not, will not benefit the operating entities. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $9.0 million primarily due to the settlement of a tax audit and the lapse of statutes of limitations in our foreign operations. The unrecognized tax benefits of $36.6 million as of December 31, 2013, if subsequently recognized, will affect our effective tax rate favorably at the time when such benefits are recognized. Accounting for Business Combinations In accordance with the accounting standard for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as customer contracts, leases and any other significant assets or liabilities and contingent consideration. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date if we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed. Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires assumptions and management’s judgment to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. During the last three years, we have completed several business combinations, including the Frankfurt Kleyer 90 Carrier Hotel acquisition in October 2013, the Dubai IBX data center acquisition in November 2012, the Asia Tone and ancotel acquisitions in July 2012 and ALOG acquisition in April 2011. Our measurement period for the Frankfurt Kleyer 90 Carrier Hotel acquisition will remain open through the fourth quarter of 2014. The purchase price allocation for the ALOG, Asia Tone and ancotel and Dubai IBX data center acquisitions was completed in the second quarter of 2012, third quarter of 2013 and fourth quarter of 2013, respectively. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we used to complete the purchase price allocations and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, which would be recorded in our statements of operations in 2014. 71 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Accounting for Impairment of Goodwill In accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform goodwill impairment reviews annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we early adopted the accounting standard update for testing goodwill for impairment. The accounting standard update provides companies with the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If, after assessing the qualitative factors, a company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. However, if a company concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we completed annual goodwill impairment reviews of the Americas reporting unit, the EMEA reporting unit and the Asia-Pacific reporting unit and concluded that there was no impairment as the fair value of these reporting units exceeded their carrying value. When we elect to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test, we use both the income and market approach. Under the income approach, we develop a five-year cash flow forecast and use our weighted-average cost of capital applicable to our reporting units as discount rates. This requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. When we elect to perform the goodwill impairment test by assessing qualitative factors determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value requires assumptions and estimates, the assessment also requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. These assumptions require significant management judgment and are inherently subject to uncertainties. As of December 31, 2013, goodwill attributable to the Americas reporting unit, the EMEA reporting unit and the Asia-Pacific reporting unit was $471.8 million, $435.0 million and $135.3 million, respectively. Future events, changing market conditions and any changes in key assumptions may result in an impairment charge. While we have not recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill to date, the development of adverse business conditions in our Americas, EMEA or Asia-Pacific reporting units, such as higher than anticipated customer churn or significantly increased operating costs, or significant deterioration of our market comparables that we use in the market approach, could result in an impairment charge in future periods. Any potential impairment charge against our goodwill would not exceed the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. 72 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Accounting for Property, Plant and Equipment We have a substantial amount of property, plant and equipment recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The vast majority of our property, plant and equipment represent the costs incurred to build out or acquire our IBX data centers. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets. The majority of our IBX data centers are in properties that are leased. We depreciate our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (subject to the term of the lease in the case of leased assets or leasehold improvements). Accounting for property, plant and equipment involves a number of accounting issues including determining the appropriate period in which to depreciate such assets, making assessments for leased properties to determine whether they are capital or operating leases, assessing such assets for potential impairment, capitalizing interest during periods of construction and assessing the asset retirement obligations required for certain leased properties that require us to return the leased properties back to their original condition at the time we decide to exit a leased property. While there are numerous judgments and uncertainties involved in accounting for property, plant and equipment that are significant, arriving at the estimated useful life of an asset requires the most critical judgment for us and changes to these estimates would have the most significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. When we lease a property for our IBX data centers, we generally enter into long-term arrangements with initial lease terms of at least 8-10 years and with renewal options generally available to us. During the next several years, a number of leases for our IBX data centers will come up for renewal. As we start approaching the end of these initial lease terms, we will need to reassess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment. In addition, we may find that our estimates for the useful lives of non-leased assets may also need to be revised periodically. We periodically review the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment and changes in these estimates in the future are possible. Another area of judgment for us in connection with our property, plant and equipment is related to lease accounting. Most of our IBX data centers are leased. Each time we enter into a new lease or lease amendment for one of our IBX data centers, we analyze each lease or lease amendment for the proper accounting. This requires certain judgments on our part such as establishing the lease term to include in a lease test, establishing the remaining estimated useful life of the underlying property or equipment and estimating the fair value of the underlying property or equipment. All of these judgments are inherently uncertain. Different assumptions or estimates could result in a different accounting treatment for a lease. During the quarter ended December 31, 2012, we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment. As a result, we recorded approximately $5.0 million of lower depreciation expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2012 due to extending the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment. We undertook this review due to our determination that we were generally using certain of our existing assets longer than originally anticipated and, therefore, the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment has been lengthened. This change was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis effective October 1, 2012 under the accounting standard for change in accounting estimates. We did not revise the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2011. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded impairment charges totaling $9.9 million associated with certain long-lived assets, of which $7.0 million was associated with property, plant and equipment. No impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2011. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had property, plant and equipment of $4.6 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recorded depreciation expense of $405.5 million, $367.0 million and $314.7 million, respectively. Further changes in our estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment could have a significant impact on our results of operations. 73 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions The assessment of long-lived assets for impairment requires assumptions and estimates of undiscounted and discounted future cash flows. These assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and are inherently uncertain. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had property, plant and equipment under capital leases and other financing obligations of $949.0 million and $555.7 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recorded depreciation expense of $32.5 million, $18.8 million and $14.2 million, respectively, related to property, plant and equipment under capital leases and other financing obligations. Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recorded rent expense of $112.7 million, $113.3 million and $111.8 million under operating leases.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk The following discussion about market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity. We employ foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging certain specifically-identified exposures. The use of these financial instruments is intended to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, but does not eliminate such risks. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Investment Portfolio Risk We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. All of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale and, therefore, are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax. We consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge for our securities, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. The Company anticipates that it will recover the entire cost basis of these securities and has determined that no other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were required to be recognized during the year ended December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market fund investments, U.S. government and agency obligations, commercial paper and certificates of deposits, corporate bonds, and asset backed securities. Excluding the U.S. government holdings, which carry a lower risk and lower return in comparison to other securities in the portfolio, the remaining amount in our investment portfolio that could be susceptible to market risk totaled $413.1 million. Interest Rate Risk Our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates or credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Securities with longer maturities are subject to a greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities. As of December 31, 2013, the average duration of our portfolio was less than one year. An immediate hypothetical shift in the yield curves of plus or minus 50 basis points from their position as of December 31, 2013, could decrease or increase the fair value of our investment portfolio by approximately $2.0 million to $3.0 million. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift of all interest rates, however, interest rates do not always move in such a manner and actual results may differ materially. We monitor our interest rate and credit risk, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers. There were no impairment charges on our cash equivalents and fixed income securities during the year ended December 31, 2013. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates from their position as of December 31, 2013 would not have a material impact on our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of the majority of our debt obligations. However, the interest expense associated with our U.S. financing and ALOG financings, which bear interest at variable rates could be affected. For every 100 basis point change in interest rates, our annual interest expense could increase or decrease by a total of approximately $2.1 million based on the total balance of our primary borrowings under the U.S. term loan and the ALOG financings as of December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, we had not employed any interest rate derivative products to help manage our debt obligations. However, we may enter into interest rate hedging agreements in the future to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk. 75 Table of Contents The fair value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate changes may affect the fair value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair value of our convertible debt, which is traded in the market, is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of our loans payable, which are not traded in the market, is estimated by considering our credit rating, current rates available to us for debt of the same remaining maturities and the terms of the debt. The following table represents the carrying value and estimated fair value of our loans payable, senior notes and convertible debt as of (in thousands): December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 CarryingValue Fair Value CarryingValue Fair Value Mortgage and loans payable $ 253,208 $ 254,607 $ 240,962 $ 238,793 Convertible debt 724,202 1,009,744 708,726 1,144,568 Senior Notes 2,250,000 2,302,290 1,500,000 1,661,400 Foreign Currency Risk The majority of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, generated mostly from customers in the U.S. However, approximately 46% of our revenues and 48% of our operating costs are attributable to Brazil, Canada and the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions and a large portion of those revenues and costs are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Brazilian Reais, Canadian dollar, British pound, Euro, Swiss franc, United Arab Emirates dirham, Australian dollar, Chinese Yuan, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar. As a result, our operating results and cash flows are impacted by currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. To protect against certain reductions in value caused by changes in currency exchange rates, we have established a risk management program to offset some of the risk of carrying assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to help manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for forecasted revenues and expenses in our EMEA region. Our risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements and its impact on the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2013, the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of less than two years. For the foreseeable future, we anticipate that approximately 40-50% of our revenues and operating costs will continue to be generated and incurred outside of the U.S. in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. During fiscal 2013, the U.S. dollar was generally strong relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate. This overall strength of the U.S. dollar had a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations because the foreign denominations translated into less U.S. dollars. In future periods, the volatility of the U.S. dollar as compared to the other currencies in which we do business could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations including the amount of revenue that we report in future periods. We may enter into additional hedging activities in the future to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency risk as our exposure to foreign currency risk continues to increase due to our growing foreign operations; however, we do not currently intend to eliminate all foreign currency transaction exposure. Commodity Price Risk Certain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of price changes are electricity, supplies and equipment used in our IBX data centers. We closely monitor the cost of electricity at all of our locations. We have entered into several power contracts to purchase power at fixed prices during 2014 and beyond in certain locations in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom. 76 Table of Contents In addition, as we are building new, or expanding existing, IBX data centers, we are subject to commodity price risk for building materials related to the construction of these IBX data centers, such as steel and copper. In addition, the lead-time to procure certain pieces of equipment, such as generators, is substantial. Any delays in procuring the necessary pieces of equipment for the construction of our IBX data centers could delay the anticipated openings of these new IBX data centers and, as a result, increase the cost of these projects. We do not currently employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to address commodity price risk other than the power contracts discussed above.",2023-12-30 20:28:26.156328

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information in this discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements are based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. For example, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist readers in understanding our financial information from our management’s perspective and is presented as follows: • Overview • Results of Operations • Non-GAAP Financial Measures • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements • Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates • Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2014, as more fully described in the Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) Conversion in Business in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed the implementation of the REIT conversion and as a result, we will make a tax election for REIT status for the taxable year commencing January 1, 2015. In December 2014, as more fully described in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we entered into a credit agreement with a group of lenders for a $1.5 billion credit facility, which is referred to as the senior credit facility, comprised of a $1.0 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility and a $500.0 million multicurrency term loan facility. We used a portion of the net proceeds of the term loan facility for the prepayment of the remaining principal balance of the previously outstanding U.S. term loan of $110.0 million. The existing U.S. revolving credit line of $550.0 million was replaced with the $1.0 billion revolving credit facility. We recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $2.5 million during the three months ended December 31, 2014 related to the prepayment and termination of the U.S. term loan and U.S. revolving credit line. In December 2014, as more fully described in Note 9 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we redeemed all of our $750.0 million 7.00% senior notes, plus accrued interest, with $866.9 million in cash, which includes the premium paid of $94.0 million. During the three months ended December 31, 2014, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $103.3 million, which included the premium paid and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of $9.3 million. In November 2014, as more fully described in Note 9 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due January 1, 2022, and $500.0 44 Table of Contents million aggregate principal amount of 5.750% senior notes due January 1, 2025, which are referred to as the 2022 senior notes and 2025 senior notes, respectively. We used a portion of the net proceeds from this senior notes offering for the redemption of our 7.00% senior notes and intend to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditure and dividend distribution. In October 2014, as more fully described in Note 11 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Board of Directors declared a special distribution of $416.0 million, or approximately $7.57 per share, which is referred to as the 2014 special distribution, to our common stockholders in connection with our plan to convert to a REIT. The 2014 special distribution was paid on November 25, 2014 to our common stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 27, 2014. Common stockholders had the option to elect to receive payment of the 2014 special distribution in the form of stock or cash, with the total cash payment to all stockholders limited to no more than 20% of the total distribution. The number of shares distributed was determined based upon common stockholder elections and the average closing price of our common stock on the three trading days commencing on November 18, 2014, or $224.45 per share. We issued 1,482,419 shares of our common stock and paid $83.3 million in connection with the 2014 special distribution. On January 1, 2015, we began operating as a REIT. See REIT conversion in Business in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In October 2014, as more fully described in Note 9 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we settled with the remaining holders of our 3.00% convertible subordinated notes. Approximately $178.7 million in aggregate principal amount of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes were converted into 1,595,496 shares of common stock. The remaining amount of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes were settled in cash. In July 2014, as more fully described in Note 2 and Note 10 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we and Riverwood Capital L.P. (“Riverwood”) entered into a purchase and sale agreement in which we acquired Riverwood’s interest in ALOG Data Centers do Brasil S.A. and its subsidiaries (“ALOG”) and the approximate 10% of ALOG owned by ALOG management, which resulted in our 100% ownership interest in ALOG. The net purchase price of $225.7 million consisted of: (i) $216.5 million of cash paid to Riverwood and ALOG management to acquire their interests in ALOG, (ii) $8.5 million of cash paid for the common shares of ALOG related to vested and outstanding stock options to purchase common shares of ALOG that were held by ALOG employees and (iii) $686,000 for the assumption of Riverwood’s portion of the contingent consideration in connection with the acquisition of ALOG in 2011. In June 2014, as more fully described in Note 9 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we entered into an agreement with a note holder to exchange an aggregate of $217.2 million of the principal amount of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes for 1,948,578 shares of our common stock and $5.4 million in cash, which was comprised of accrued interest and a premium. As a result, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $4.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. In May and June 2014, as more fully described in Note 9 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we entered into agreements with certain note holders to exchange an aggregate of $215.8 million of the principal amount of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes for 2,411,851 shares of our common stock and $51.7 million in cash, which was comprised of accrued interest, a premium and cash paid in lieu of issuing shares for certain note holders’ principal. As a result, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $47.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Overview Equinix provides global data center offerings that protect and connect the world’s most valued information assets. Global enterprises, financial services companies and content and network service providers rely upon Equinix’s leading insight and data centers in 33 markets around the world for the safekeeping of their critical IT 45 Table of Contents equipment and the ability to directly connect to the networks that enable today’s information-driven economy. Equinix offers the following solutions: (i) premium data center colocation, (ii) interconnection and (iii) exchange and outsourced IT infrastructure services. As of December 31, 2014, we operated or had partner International Business Exchange (“IBX”) data centers in the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Seattle, Silicon Valley, Toronto and Washington, D.C. metro areas in the Americas region; France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) region; and Australia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan and Singapore in the Asia-Pacific region. Our data centers in 33 markets around the world are a global platform, which allows our customers to increase information and application delivery performance while significantly reducing costs. This global platform and the quality of our IBX data centers have enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. As more customers choose our IBX data centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate with us as well, in order to gain the full economic and performance benefits of our offerings. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a “marketplace” for their services. Our global platform enables scalable, reliable and cost-effective colocation, interconnection and traffic exchange that lowers overall cost and increases flexibility. Our focused business model is built on our critical mass of customers and the resulting “marketplace” effect. This global platform, combined with our strong financial position, continues to drive new customer growth and bookings. Historically, our market has been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled telecommunications products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include cloud computing/utility providers, application hosting providers and systems integrators, managed infrastructure hosting providers and colocation providers. More than 350 companies provide data center solutions in the U.S. alone. Each of these data center solutions providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings, and outsourced IT infrastructure services. We are able to offer our customers a global platform that reaches 15 countries with proven operational reliability, improved application performance and network choice, and a highly scalable set of offerings. Our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus net sellable cabinet space available, taking into account power limitations. Our utilization rate was approximately 78% and 76% as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. However, excluding the impact of IBX data center expansion projects that have opened during the last 12 months, our utilization rate would be approximately 81% as of December 31, 2014. Our utilization rate varies from market to market among our IBX data centers across the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain high power-demand customers. This increased power consumption has driven us to build out our new IBX data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX data centers. We could face power limitations in our IBX data centers, even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific IBX data center. This could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given IBX data center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows. Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and offerings. As was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors, such as demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to break even on a free cash flow basis, and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may 46 Table of Contents be attractive to us. Depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to Equinix standards. Property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant. Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related interconnection and managed infrastructure offerings. We consider these offerings recurring because our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. In addition, during any given quarter of the past three years, more than half of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, our largest customer accounted for approximately 2% of our recurring revenues for the periods then ended. Our 50 largest customers accounted for approximately 36%, 35% and 34% of our recurring revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer’s initial deployment and professional services that we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring because they are billed typically once, upon completion of the installation or the professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. However, revenues from installation services are deferred and recognized ratably over the expected life of the customer installation. Additionally, revenue from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is recognized when no remaining performance obligations exist and collectability is reasonably assured, to the extent that the revenue has not previously been recognized. As a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future. Our Americas revenues are derived primarily from colocation and related interconnection offerings, and our EMEA and Asia-Pacific revenues are derived primarily from colocation and managed infrastructure offerings. The largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX data centers, utility costs, including electricity and bandwidth, IBX data center employees’ salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment and security services. A substantial majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing IBX data centers or open or acquire new IBX data centers. However, there are certain costs that are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. We expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will generally increase in the future on a per-unit or fixed basis, in addition to the variable increase related to the growth in consumption by our customers. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months, as compared to other times of the year. To the extent we incur increased utility costs, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, to the extent we incur increased electricity costs as a result of either climate change policies or the physical effects of climate change, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer contract intangible assets. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees, and other general corporate expenses, such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and some depreciation expense. 47 Table of Contents Due to our recurring revenue model, and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature and generally does not grow in proportion to revenue growth, we expect our cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses to decline as a percentage of revenues over time, although we expect each of them to grow in absolute dollars in connection with our growth. However, for cost of revenues, this trend may periodically be impacted when a large expansion project opens or is acquired, and before it starts generating any meaningful revenue. Furthermore, in relation to cost of revenues, we note that the Americas region has a lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue than either EMEA or Asia-Pacific. This is due to both the increased scale and maturity of the Americas region, compared to either the EMEA or Asia-Pacific region, as well as a higher cost structure outside of the Americas, particularly in EMEA. While we expect all three regions to continue to see lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in future periods, we expect the trend that sees the Americas having the lowest cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to continue. As a result, to the extent that revenue growth outside the Americas grows in greater proportion than revenue growth in the Americas, our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may increase in future periods. Sales and marketing expenses may periodically increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to scale our operations to invest in sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue, including the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovations. General and administrative expenses may also periodically increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth. Results of Operations Our results of operations for the year ended 2013 include the operations of the Frankfurt Kleyer 90 carrier hotel acquisition from October 1, 2013. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 include the operations of the Dubai IBX data center acquisition from November 9, 2012, Asia Tone from July 4, 2012 and ancotel from July 3, 2012. Discontinued Operations We present the results of operations associated with 16 of our IBX centers that we sold in November 2012 as net income from discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations. Our results of operations have been reclassified to reflect our discontinued operations for all applicable periods presented. Unless otherwise stated, the results of operations discussed herein refer to our continuing operations. 48 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2014 % 2013 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas: Recurring revenues $ 1,311,518 54 % $ 1,214,301 56 % 8 % 10 % Non-recurring revenues 64,585 3 % 50,473 3 % 28 % 28 % 1,376,103 57 % 1,264,774 59 % 9 % 11 % EMEA: Recurring revenues 598,953 24 % 492,361 23 % 22 % 19 % Non-recurring revenues 38,312 1 % 32,657 1 % 17 % 19 % 637,265 25 % 525,018 24 % 21 % 19 % Asia-Pacific: Recurring revenues 407,319 17 % 343,300 16 % 19 % 22 % Non-recurring revenues 23,089 1 % 19,674 1 % 17 % 26 % 430,408 18 % 362,974 17 % 19 % 22 % Total: Recurring revenues 2,317,790 95 % 2,049,962 95 % 13 % 14 % Non-recurring revenues 125,986 5 % 102,804 5 % 23 % 25 % $ 2,443,776 100 % $ 2,152,766 100 % 14 % 15 % Americas Revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our revenues from the United States, the largest revenue contributor in the Americas region for the periods, represented approximately 91% of the regional revenues. Growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to (i) $38.3 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers and IBX data center expansions in the Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Miami, New York and Sao Paolo metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our utilization rate, as discussed above. During the year ended December 31, 2014, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $22.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Americas revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian reais and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. We expect that our Americas revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in the recently-opened IBX data centers and additional IBX data center expansions currently taking place in the Dallas, New York, Philadelphia, Rio de Janeiro, Seattle, Silicon Valley, Toronto and Washington, D.C. metro areas, which are expected to open during 2015. Our estimates of future revenue growth also take into account expected changes in recurring revenues attributed to customer bookings, customer churn or changes or amendments to customers’ contracts. EMEA Revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our revenues from the United Kingdom, the largest revenue contributor in the EMEA region for the periods, represented approximately 36% of the regional revenues. Our EMEA revenue growth was due to (i) $20.0 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers and IBX data center expansions in the Amsterdam and Frankfurt metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. During the year ended December 31, 2014, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $11.1 million of favorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA revenues primarily due to the generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss franc during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. We expect that our EMEA revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of 49 Table of Contents continued growth in recently-opened IBX data centers and an additional IBX data center expansion currently taking place in the Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris metro areas, which are expected to open during 2015. Our estimates of future revenue growth also take into account expected changes in recurring revenues attributed to customer bookings, customer churn or changes or amendments to customers’ contracts. Asia-Pacific Revenues. Our revenues from Singapore, the largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, represented approximately 38% and 36%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Our Asia-Pacific revenue growth was due to (i) $53.4 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers and IBX data center expansions in the Hong Kong, Melbourne, Osaka, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. During the year ended December 31, 2014, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $13.7 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Asia-Pacific revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. We expect that our Asia-Pacific revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in these recently-opened IBX data center expansions and additional expansions currently taking place in the Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo metro areas, which are expected to open during 2015 and 2016. Our estimates of future revenue growth also take into account expected changes in recurring revenues attributed to customer bookings, customer churn or changes or amendments to customers’ contracts. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2014 % 2013 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas $ 605,184 51 % $ 576,869 54 % 5 % 8 % EMEA 337,095 28 % 271,965 26 % 24 % 22 % Asia-Pacific 255,606 21 % 215,569 20 % 19 % 22 % Total $ 1,197,885 100 % $ 1,064,403 100 % 13 % 14 % Years endedDecember 31, 2014 2013 Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues: Americas 44 % 46 % EMEA 53 % 52 % Asia-Pacific 59 % 59 % Total 49 % 49 % Americas Cost of Revenues. Our Americas cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 included $218.4 million and $216.6 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in our Americas cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $17.7 million of higher utilities and repair and maintenance expense in support of our business growth, (ii) $8.7 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (941 employees included in Americas cost of revenues as of December 31, 2014 versus 894 as of December 31, 2013), (iii) $8.1 million of higher costs associated with equipment resales to support the growth of non-recurring revenues and (iv) $3.9 million of higher accretion expenses as a result of the reversal of asset retirement obligations during the year ended December 31, 2013 associated with the execution of certain lease amendments, partially offset by $12.9 million of lower rent and facility costs primarily as a result of either certain leases no longer being subject to operating lease treatment or the purchase of previously-leased sites. During the year ended December 31, 2014, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $16.3 million of favorable foreign currency impact on our 50 Table of Contents Americas cost of revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian reais and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. We expect Americas cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business. EMEA Cost of Revenues. EMEA cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 included $97.8 million and $77.9 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX data center expansion activity. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in our EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $29.9 million of higher utility costs, repair and maintenance, professional fees and rent and facility costs in support of our revenue growth, (ii) $7.4 million of higher compensation, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (473 employees included in EMEA cost of revenues as of December 31, 2014 versus 396 as of December 31, 2013) and (iii) $5.8 million of higher costs associated with equipment resales, bandwidth and other customer services in support of our non- recurring revenues growth. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA cost of revenues primarily due to the generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss franc during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. We expect EMEA cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 included $101.4 million and $82.6 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX data center expansion activity. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $13.7 million in higher utility costs, repairs and maintenance costs, as well as rent and facility costs in support of our revenue growth; (ii) $2.7 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (342 employees included in Asia-Pacific cost of revenues as of December 31, 2014 versus 289 as of December 31, 2013) and (iii) $3.3 million of higher costs associated with equipment resales in support of our non-recurring revenues growth. During the year ended December 31, 2014, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $8.4 million of net favorable foreign currency impact on our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. We expect Asia-Pacific cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business. Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2014 % 2013 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas $ 172,264 58 % $ 144,178 58 % 19 % 21 % EMEA 79,890 27 % 68,925 28 % 16 % 12 % Asia-Pacific 43,949 15 % 33,520 14 % 31 % 35 % Total $ 296,103 100 % $ 246,623 100 % 20 % 21 % Years endedDecember 31, 2014 2013 Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues: Americas 13 % 11 % EMEA 13 % 13 % Asia-Pacific 10 % 9 % Total 12 % 11 % Americas Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our Americas sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to (i) $21.6 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, commission, stock-based compensation as a result of headcount growth (450 Americas sales and 51 Table of Contents marketing employees as of December 31, 2014 versus 395 as of December 31, 2013), which incorporates a change in our sales commission practices whereby our sales commission accrual will occur when sales orders are booked versus when the sales orders are billed and (ii) $5.3 million of higher travel, advertising and promotion costs in support of our business growth. During the year ended December 31, 2014, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $2.5 million of favorable foreign currency impact on our Americas sales and marketing expenses primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian reais and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our Americas sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts. Although we anticipate that we will continue to invest in Americas sales and marketing initiatives, we believe our Americas sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues will remain at approximately current levels over the next year or two but should ultimately decrease as we continue to grow our business. EMEA Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our EMEA sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $8.2 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense as a result of business growth, which incorporates a change in our sales commission practices whereby our sales commission accrual will occur when sales orders are booked versus when the sales orders are billed. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our EMEA sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2013. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our EMEA sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts and, as a result, our EMEA sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues have increased. Although we anticipate that we will continue to invest in EMEA sales and marketing initiatives, we believe our EMEA sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues will remain at approximately current levels over the next year or two but should ultimately decrease as we continue to grow our business. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $9.5 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, commission, stock-based compensation as a result of business and headcount growth (155 Asia-Pacific sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2014 versus 120 as of December 31, 2013), which incorporates a change in our sales commission practices whereby our sales commission accrual will occur when sales orders are booked versus when the sales orders are billed. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2013. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts and, as a result, our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses have increased. Although we anticipate that we will continue to invest in Asia-Pacific sales and marketing initiatives, we believe our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues will remain at approximately current levels over the next year or two but should ultimately decrease as we continue to grow our business. General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2014 % 2013 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas $ 315,533 72 % $ 263,145 70 % 20 % 21 % EMEA 79,942 18 % 72,867 19 % 10 % 7 % Asia-Pacific 42,541 10 % 38,778 11 % 10 % 12 % Total $ 438,016 100 % $ 374,790 100 % 17 % 17 % 52 Table of Contents Years endedDecember 31, 2014 2013 General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues: Americas 23 % 21 % EMEA 13 % 14 % Asia-Pacific 10 % 11 % Total 18 % 17 % Americas General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $24.9 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, as a result of headcount growth (731 Americas general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2014 versus 695 as of December 31, 2013) and the exercise of the ALOG stock options, (ii) $15.2 million of higher professional fees, recruiting, training and travel expenses to support the REIT conversion, (iii) $5.4 million of higher depreciation expenses primarily due to implementation of the Oracle R12 ERP system and certain systems to support the REIT conversion and (iv) $4.0 million higher of office expenses in support of our business growth. During the year ended December 31, 2014, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $2.4 million of favorable foreign currency impact on our Americas general and administrative expenses primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian reais and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Over the course of the past year, we have been investing in our Americas general and administrative functions to scale this region effectively for growth, which has included additional investments into improving our back office systems. We expect our current efforts to improve our back office systems will continue over the next several years. We also incurred costs to support our REIT conversion process. Collectively, these investments in our back office systems and our REIT conversion process have resulted in increased professional fees. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect Americas general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to further scale our operations to support our growth, including these investments in our back office systems and maintaining our REIT qualification. EMEA General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our EMEA general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) approximately $3.7 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (353 EMEA general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2014 versus 301 as of December 31, 2013) and (ii) $2.5 million of higher depreciation expenses due to implementation of the Oracle R12 ERP system and certain systems to support the REIT conversion. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $2.0 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA general and administrative expenses primarily due to the generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss franc during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect our EMEA general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth; however, as a percentage of revenues, we generally expect them to decrease. Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was primarily due to $4.2 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and headcount growth (224 Asia-Pacific general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2014 versus 208 as of December 31, 2013). For the year ended December 31, 2014, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2013. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth; however, as a percentage of revenues, we generally expect them to decrease. 53 Table of Contents Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we did not record any restructuring charges. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a $4.8 million reversal of the restructuring charge accrual for our excess space in the New York 2 IBX data center as a result of our decision to purchase this property and utilize the space. See “Restructuring Charges” in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Acquisition Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $2.5 million primarily attributed to the EMEA region. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $10.9 million primarily attributed to our Americas and EMEA regions. Interest Income. Interest income was $2.9 million and $3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 0.33% versus 0.32% for the year ended December 31, 2013. We expect our interest income to remain at these low levels for the foreseeable future due to the impact of a continued low interest rate environment and a portfolio more weighted towards short-term securities. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $270.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $248.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase in interest expense was primarily due to the impact of our $1.25 billion senior notes offering in November 2014 and $29.8 million of higher interest expense from various capital lease and other financing obligations to support our expansion projects, which was offset by the redemption of our 7.00% senior notes in December 2014, the settlement of the 3.00% convertible notes, the partial redemption of the 4.75% convertible notes in June 2014 and more capitalized interest expense. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we capitalized $19.0 million and $10.6 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. Going forward, we expect to incur higher interest expense as we recognize the full impact of our $1.25 billion senior notes and $1.5 billion senior credit facility offerings, partially offset by the redemption of our 7.00% senior notes, settlement of our 3.00% convertible notes and prepayment and termination of our $750.0 million multicurrency credit facility. We may also incur additional indebtedness to support our growth, resulting in higher interest expense. Other Income (Expense). We recorded $0.1 million and $5.3 million, respectively, of other income for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains (losses) during the periods. Loss on debt extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a $157.0 million loss on debt extinguishment, of which $51.2 million was attributable to the exchanges of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes and 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, $103.3 million was attributable to the redemption of our $750.0 million 7.00% senior notes and $2.5 million was attributable to the prepayment and termination of our $750.0 million multicurrency credit facility. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a $108.5 million loss on debt extinguishment, of which $93.6 million was attributable to the redemption of our $750 million 8.125% senior notes, $13.2 million was attributable to the extinguishment of the financing liabilities for our London 4 and 5 IBX data centers and $1.7 million was attributable to an amendment of our New York 5 and 6 IBX lease. For additional information, see “Loss on Debt Extinguishment” in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded $345.5 million of income tax expense. The income tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to the statutory tax rate change due to our REIT conversion, which resulted in a $324.1 million domestic deferred tax assets write-off. In connection with the formal approval of our conversion to a REIT by our Board of Directors in December 2014, we reassessed the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our U.S. operations included in the REIT structure in the fourth quarter of 2014. The reevaluation resulted in de-recognizing the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our REIT’s U.S. operations, excluding the deferred tax liabilities associated with the depreciation and amortization recapture expected in 2015. The de-recognition of the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our REIT’s U.S. operations occurred because the expected recovery or settlement of the related 54 Table of Contents assets and liabilities will not result in deductible or taxable amounts in any post-REIT conversion periods. The deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with our foreign operations, regardless of whether such foreign operations are part of the REIT conversion, are not subject to the de-recognition assessment. In addition, we don’t expect any “built-in” gains to be recognized within the next 10 years with respect to the REIT conversion. As of December 31, 2014, we had a net deferred tax liability of approximately $52.2 million for our domestic operations, which include approximately $82.5 million of deferred tax liabilities associated with the depreciation and amortization recapture. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded $16.2 million of income tax expense. The income tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily attributable to our foreign operations, as we incurred losses in our domestic operations during the period. Our effective tax rates were 407.7% and 14.4%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to tax expense attributable to the domestic deferred tax assets write-off as a result of our REIT conversion. Excluding this tax expense, our effective tax rate would have been 25.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we utilized all of our federal net operating losses free of Section 382 limitations in the U.S. for which a deferred tax asset had been previously recognized and all of our windfall tax losses in the U.S. for which a deferred tax asset had not been previously recognized. We recorded excess income tax benefits of $18.6 million and $25.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheet. To better align our EMEA corporate structure and intercompany relationship with the nature of our business activities and regional centralization, we commenced certain reorganization activities during the fourth quarter of 2012 in the EMEA region. The new organizational structure centralized the majority of our EMEA business management activities in the Netherlands effective July 1, 2013. In December 2013, our Dutch subsidiaries that were created to carry-out EMEA’s centralized management activities received favorable rulings from the Dutch Tax Authorities effective July 1, 2013. The rulings acknowledge the reorganization and agree to a lower level of earnings by our Dutch subsidiaries subject to tax in the Netherlands. The rulings also require both the Dutch Tax Authorities and our Dutch subsidiaries to revisit and renew the agreement in five years from the effective date. As a result, we expect our overall effective tax rate will be lower in subsequent periods as the new structure takes full effect. Assuming no material changes to tax rules and regulations, with our REIT conversion taking effect we expect our effective long-term worldwide cash tax rate to ultimately decrease to a range of 10% to 15%. Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a key factor in how we assess the performance of our segments, measure the operational cash generating abilities of our segments and develop regional growth strategies such as IBX data center expansion decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is the result of our revenues less our adjusted operating expenses. Our adjusted operating expenses exclude depreciation expense, amortization expense, accretion expense, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges and acquisition costs. Periodically, we enter into new lease agreements or amend existing lease agreements. To the extent we conclude that a lease is an operating lease, the rent expense may decrease our adjusted EBITDA whereas to the extent we conclude that a lease is a capital or financing lease, and this lease was previously reported as an operating lease, this outcome may increase our adjusted EBITDA. Our adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2014 % 2013 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas $ 635,007 57 % $ 608,718 61 % 4 % 6 % EMEA 269,222 24 % 216,186 22 % 25 % 22 % Asia-Pacific 209,662 19 % 175,994 17 % 19 % 23 % Total $ 1,113,891 100 % $ 1,000,898 100 % 11 % 12 % 55 Table of Contents Americas Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our Americas adjusted EBITDA was due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by higher adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation expense and higher professional fees to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2014, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $8.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Americas adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian reais and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. EMEA Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our EMEA adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by higher adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation expense and higher professional fees to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2014, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.9 million of net favorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and Swiss franc during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Asia-Pacific Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by higher adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation expense and higher professional fees to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2014, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $7.0 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 Revenues.

Growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to (i) $58.6 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers and IBX data center expansions in the Chicago, Rio de Janeiro, Seattle, Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate. During the year ended December 31, 2013, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $9.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Americas revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian reais and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. EMEA Revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, our revenues from the United Kingdom, the largest revenue contributor in the EMEA region for the period, represented approximately 36% and 38%, respectively, of the regional revenues.

During the year ended December 31, 2013, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $8.5 million of favorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA revenues primarily due to the generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and Swiss franc during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Asia-Pacific Revenues. Our revenues from Singapore, the largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, represented approximately 36% and 37%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. Our Asia-Pacific revenue growth was due to $30.0 million of incremental revenue resulting from the Asia Tone acquisition and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our customer count and utilization rate, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. During the year ended December 31, 2013, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $17.6 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Asia-Pacific revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2012. Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a $4.8 million reversal of the restructuring charge accrual for our excess space in the New York 2 IBX data center as a result of our decision to purchase this property and utilize the space. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we did not record any restructuring charges. For additional information, see “Restructuring Charges” in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Impairment Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we did not record any impairment charges. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded impairment charges totaling $9.9 million as a result of the fair values of certain long-lived assets being lower than their carrying values due to our decision to abandon two properties in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions. For additional information, see “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Acquisition Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $10.9 million primarily attributed to our Americas and EMEA regions. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $8.8 million primarily attributed to the ancotel and Asia Tone acquisitions. Interest Income. Interest income was $3.4 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2013 was 0.32% versus 0.43% for the year ended December 31, 2012. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $248.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 from $200.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase in interest expense was primarily due to the impact of our $1.5 billion senior notes offering in March 2013, $15.6 million of higher interest expense from various capital lease and other financing obligations to support our expansion projects and less capitalized interest expense, which was partially offset by the redemption of our 8.125% senior notes in April 2013. During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we capitalized $10.6 million and $30.6 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. Other Income (Expense). For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded $5.3 million of other income and $2.2 million of other expense for the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains (losses) during the periods. Loss on debt extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a $108.5 million loss on debt extinguishment, of which $93.6 million was attributable to the redemption of our $750.0 million 8.125% senior notes, $13.2 million was attributable to the extinguishment of the financing liabilities for our London 4 and 5 IBX data centers and $1.7 million was attributable to an amendment of our New York 5 and 6 IBX lease. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded $5.2 million of loss on debt extinguishment due to the repayment and termination of our multi-currency credit facility in the Asia-Pacific region. For additional information, see “Loss on Debt Extinguishment” in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 60 Table of Contents Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded $16.2 million of income tax expense. The income tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily attributable to our foreign operations, as we incurred losses in our domestic operations during the period as a result of the $93.6 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the redemption of our $750.0 million 8.125% senior notes. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded $58.6 million of income tax expense. The income tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily a result of applying the effective statutory tax rates to our operating income adjusted for permanent tax adjustments for the period and the assessments of valuation allowances of $5.5 million against the net deferred tax assets with certain foreign operating entities. Our effective tax rates were 14.4% and 31.0%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. The decrease in our effective tax rates between 2013 and 2012 was primarily attributable to the effective tax rate benefits associated with losses incurred by our domestic operations and the new organizational structure in EMEA which became effective July 1, 2013. The cash taxes for 2013 were primarily for U.S. and foreign income taxes in certain European jurisdictions and for 2012 were primarily for state and foreign income taxes. As of December 31, 2013, we had a net deferred tax asset of approximately $147.1 million for our U.S. operations, which included approximately $176.0 million of deferred tax liabilities associated with the depreciation and amortization recapture. Net Income from Discontinued Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we did not have any discontinued operations. For the year ended December 31, 2012, our net income from discontinued operations was $13.1 million, consisting of $11.9 million from the gain on sale of discontinued operations, net of income tax, and $1.2 million of net income from discontinued operations. For additional information, see “Discontinued Operations” in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA. Our adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2013 % 2012 % Actual Constantcurrency Americas $ 608,718 61 % $ 557,800 63 % 9 % 10 % EMEA 216,186 22 % 183,612 21 % 18 % 13 % Asia-Pacific 175,994 17 % 146,445 16 % 20 % 26 % Total $ 1,000,898 100 % $ 887,857 100 % 13 % 13 % Americas Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our Americas adjusted EBITDA was due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above. During the year ended December 31, 2013, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $3.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Americas adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian reais and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. EMEA Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our EMEA adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to (i) additional adjusted EBITDA from the impact of acquisitions, which generated $15.2 million of incremental adjusted EBITDA and (ii) our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth, partially offset by higher adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation expense and higher professional fees to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2013, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $8.0 million of net favorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and Swiss franc during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. 61 Table of Contents Asia-Pacific Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to (i) additional adjusted EBITDA from the impact of the Asia Tone acquisition, which generated $14.3 million of incremental adjusted EBITDA and (ii) higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth. During the year ended December 31, 2013, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $7.8 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We provide all information required in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), but we believe that evaluating our ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, we use non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operations. Legislative and regulatory requirements encourage the use of and emphasis on GAAP financial metrics and require companies to explain why non-GAAP financial metrics are relevant to management and investors. Adjusted EBITDA We use adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our continuing operations and as a metric in the determination of employees’ annual bonuses and vesting of restricted stock units that have both a service and performance condition. In presenting adjusted EBITDA, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future operating performance. These items are depreciation, amortization, accretion of asset retirement obligations and accrued restructuring charges, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges and acquisition costs. Legislative and regulatory requirements encourage the use of and emphasis on GAAP financial metrics and require companies to explain why non-GAAP financial metrics are relevant to management and investors. We exclude these items in order for our lenders, investors, and industry analysts, who review and report on us, to better evaluate our operating performance and cash spending levels relative to our industry sector and competitors. For example, we exclude depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of our IBX data centers and do not reflect our current or future cash spending levels to support our business. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of our IBX data centers do not recur and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to our initial investment. This is a trend we expect to continue. In addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of our IBX data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs incurred to build out our IBX data centers, and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. Therefore, we exclude depreciation from our operating results when evaluating our continuing operations. In addition, in presenting the non-GAAP financial measures, we exclude amortization expense related to certain intangible assets, as it represents a cost that may not recur and is not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance. We exclude accretion expense, both as it relates to asset retirement obligations as well as accrued restructuring charge liabilities, as these expenses represent costs which we believe are not meaningful in evaluating our current operations. We exclude stock-based compensation expense as it primarily represents expense attributed to equity awards that have no current or future cash obligations. As such, we, and many investors and analysts, exclude this stock-based compensation expense when assessing the cash generating performance of our continuing operations. We also exclude restructuring charges from our non-GAAP financial measures. The restructuring charges relate to our decisions to exit leases for excess space adjacent to several of our IBX data centers, which we did not intend to build out, or our decision to reverse such restructuring charges. We also exclude impairment charges related to certain long-lived assets. The impairment charges are related to expense recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived 62 Table of Contents assets are not recoverable. Finally, we exclude acquisition costs from our non-GAAP financial measures. The acquisition costs relate to costs we incur in connection with business combinations. Management believes such items as restructuring charges, impairment charges and acquisition costs are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs will or may occur in future periods. Our management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. However, we have presented such non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. We believe that the inclusion of this non-GAAP financial measure provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and its ability to perform in subsequent periods. We believe that if we did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze Equinix effectively. Investors should note, however, that the non-GAAP financial measures used by us may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. In addition, whenever we use non-GAAP financial measures, we provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges and acquisition costs as presented below (in thousands): Years ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Income from operations $ 509,266 $ 460,932 $ 392,896 Depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense 484,129 431,008 393,543 Stock-based compensation expense 117,990 102,940 82,735 Restructuring charges — (4,837 ) — Impairment charges — — 9,861 Acquisition costs 2,506 10,855 8,822 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,113,891 $ 1,000,898 $ 887,857 Our adjusted EBITDA results have improved each year and in each region in total dollars due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in “Results of Operations”, as well as the nature of our business model consisting of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature also discussed earlier in “Overview”. Although we have also been investing in our future growth as described above (e.g. through additional IBX data center expansions, acquisitions and increased investments in sales and marketing), we believe that our adjusted EBITDA results will continue to improve in future periods as we continue to grow our business. Constant Currency Presentation Our revenues and certain operating expenses (cost of revenues, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses) from our international operations have represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues and certain operating expenses. As a result, our revenues and certain operating expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. dollar against major international currencies such as the Brazilian reais, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Chinese Yuan, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar. In order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, 63 Table of Contents we present period-over-period percentage changes in our revenues and certain operating expenses on a constant currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, we have presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results. To present this information, our current and comparative prior period revenues and certain operating expenses from entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2013 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2014 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2014 with the year ended December 31, 2013, and average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2012 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2013 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2013 with the year ended December 31, 2012). Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2014, our total indebtedness was comprised of (i) convertible debt principal totaling $157.9 million from our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes and (ii) non-convertible debt and financing obligations totaling approximately $4.5 billion consisting of (a) approximately $2.8 billion of principal from our senior notes, (b) approximately $1.2 billion from our capital lease and other financing obligations, and (c) $595.8 million of principal from our mortgage and loans payable. We believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of the current portion of our debt as it becomes due, payment of tax liabilities related to our conversion to a REIT (see below), payment of the cash portion of the special distributions, payment of regular dividends and completion of our publicly-announced expansion projects. As of December 31, 2014, we had $1.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, of which approximately $964.8 million was held in the U.S. We believe that our current expansion activities in the U.S. can be funded with our U.S.-based cash and cash equivalents and investments. Besides our investment portfolio, we have additional liquidity available to us from the $1.0 billion revolving credit facility that forms part of our $1.5 billion senior credit facility. As of December 31, 2014, we had 26 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $43.3 million issued and outstanding under the revolving credit facility; as a result, we had a total of approximately $956.7 million of additional liquidity available to us under the revolving credit facility. Besides any further financing activities we may pursue, customer collections are our primary source of cash. While we believe we have a strong customer base, and have continued to experience relatively strong collections, if the current market conditions were to deteriorate, some of our customers may have difficulty paying us and we may experience increased churn in our customer base, including reductions in their commitments to us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Additionally, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build out of new IBX data centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as potential acquisitions. We are also now operating as a REIT (see below). While we expect to fund these plans with our existing resources, additional financing, either debt or equity, may be required if current market conditions were to deteriorate, we may be unable to secure additional financing or any such additional financing may only be available to us on unfavorable terms. An inability to pursue additional expansion opportunities will have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our desired level of revenue growth in future periods. Impact of REIT Conversion We have incurred $81.4 million in costs to support our conversion to a REIT, including $49.7 million in 2014. We estimate that we will incur $2.0 million of one-time implementation costs to support the REIT conversion in 2015. In addition, we expect to incur approximately a total of $360.0 to $370.0 million in tax liabilities associated with a change in our methods of depreciating and amortizing various data center assets for tax purposes from our prior methods to methods that are more consistent with the characterization of such assets as real property for REIT purposes. The recapture expenses are generally payable over a four-year period starting 64 Table of Contents in 2012 and, as of December 31, 2014, we have settled $281.0 million of the estimated federal and state tax liability related to the recapture of depreciation and amortization expenses. Prior to our decision to convert to a REIT, our balance sheet reflected our income tax liability as a non-current deferred tax liability. As a result of the REIT conversion, our non-current tax liability has been and will continue to be gradually and proportionally reclassified from non-current to current over the four-year period, which started in the third quarter of 2012. The current liability reflects the tax liability that relates to additional taxable income expected to be recognized within the twelve-month period from the date of the balance sheet. As a REIT, we also expect to incur approximately $10.0 million annually in compliance costs beginning in 2015. On October 16, 2014, we announced the declaration by our Board of Directors of the 2014 Special Distribution, payable in either common stock or cash to, and at the election of, our stockholders of record as of the Record Date. Common stockholders elected to receive payment of the 2014 Special Distribution in the form of stock or cash, with the total cash payment to all stockholders limited to no more than 20% of the total distribution. The value of the 2014 Special Distribution, plus the value of the deemed distribution associated with the 2014 Conversion Rate Adjustment, exceeded our Pre-2015 Accumulated E&P. In addition, we intend to declare one or more 2015 Special Distributions, which would encompass some extraordinary items of taxable income that we expect to recognize in 2015, such as depreciation recapture in respect of accounting method changes commenced in our pre-REIT period as well as foreign earnings and profits recognized as dividend income. We estimate the aggregate amount of our Special Distributions in both 2014 and 2015, together with the expected value of the deemed distributions associated with the Conversion Rate Adjustments, will equal approximately $1.0 to $1.1 billion. We expect to pay the 2015 Special Distributions in a combination of our common stock and cash, with at least 80% of the total 2015 Special Distributions in the form of common stock and up to 20% in cash. The conversion of our existing data center operations into the REIT and the addition of new entities into the REIT may also result in future special distributions. We also expect to begin paying quarterly dividends in 2015 in connection with our conversion to a REIT effective January 1, 2015. On February 19, 2015, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $1.69 per share payable on March 25, 2015, to shareholders of record on March 11, 2015. Sources and Uses of Cash Years ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 (dollars in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 689,420 $ 604,608 $ 632,026 Net cash used in investing activities (435,839 ) (1,169,313 ) (442,873 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 107,401 574,907 (222,721 ) Operating Activities The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to improved operating results, offset by unfavorable working capital activities such as decreased collections of customer receivables and a $51.4 million increase in interest payments. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily attributed to unfavorable working capital activities, such as $87.0 million and $25.3 million, respectively, of higher payments of income taxes and interest in 2013, partially offset by improved operating results. During 2014, we experienced an increase in days sales outstanding (“DSO”). We have recently centralized responsibilities for billing and collection in the EMEA region. This transition of responsibilities resulted in an increase to our DSO. We are also implementing a new billing system. The initial implementation of this system was completed in August 2014 with additional changes deployed into production during the fourth quarter of 2014, but the full implementation of the system is not expected to be complete until 2015. The ongoing changes to the billing system may result in further delays in our billing and collections. We expect our collections to improve over time. Further, we expect we will continue to generate cash from our operating activities during 2015. 65 Table of Contents Investing Activities The decrease in net cash used in investing activities during 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to $423.0 million of lower purchases of investments, $295.7 million of higher sales and maturities of investments $57.5 million of lower real estate purchases and $49.3 million of lower business acquisition spending, partially offset by $87.8 million of higher capital expenditures as a result of more IBX expansion activity. The increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to $526.1 million of higher purchases of investments, $452.3 million of lower sales and maturities of investments and $49.7 million of higher real estate purchases, partially offset by $260.2 million of lower business acquisition spending and $192.1 million of lower capital expenditures as a result of less expansion activity. During 2015, we expect that our IBX expansion construction activity will be greater than our 2014 levels. However, if the opportunity to expand is greater than planned and we have sufficient funding to pursue such expansion opportunities, we may further increase the level of capital expenditures to support this growth as well as pursue additional business acquisitions, property acquisitions or joint ventures. Financing Activities The net cash provided by financing activities for 2014 was primarily due to $1.25 billion of proceeds from the senior notes offering in November 2014, $500.0 million of proceeds from the term loan facility, partially offset by (i) $1.1 billion for repayment of debt including $750.0 million for the redemption of the 7.00% senior notes, prepayment of the remaining principal balance of the U.S. term loan of $110.0 million, $43.5 million for repayments of mortgage and other loan payable, and $29.5 million for the exchanges of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes and 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, (ii) $298.0 million for the purchases of treasury stock, (iii) $226.3 million for the purchase of Riverwood’s interest in ALOG and the approximate 10% of ALOG owned by ALOG management and (iv) $83.3 million for the cash portion of the special distribution. The net cash provided by financing activities for 2013 was primarily due to $1.5 billion of proceeds from the senior notes offering in March 2013, partially offset by $834.7 million for the redemption of the $750.0 million 8.125% senior notes, repayments of various debt and purchases of treasury stock. The net cash used in financing activities for 2012 was primarily due to the repayment of our multi-currency credit facility in the Asia-Pacific region and the settlement of the $250.0 million 2.50% convertible subordinated notes, partially offset by proceeds from the U.S. financing and the ALOG financings. Going forward, we expect that our financing activities will consist primarily of repayment of our debt and additional financings needed to support expansion opportunities, additional acquisitions or joint ventures, the payment of our regular cash dividends and the cash portion of our 2015 Special Distributions. Debt Obligations Debt Facilities We have various debt obligations with maturity dates ranging from 2016 to 2025 under which a total principal balance of $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2014. For further information on debt obligations, see “Debt Facilities” in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Capital Lease and Other Financing Obligations We have numerous capital lease and other financing obligations with maturity dates ranging from 2015 to 2053 under which a total principal balance of $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2014 with a weighted average effective interest rate of 8.43%. For further information on our capital leases and other financing obligations, see “Capital Leases and Other Financing Obligations” in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 66 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements We lease a majority of our IBX data centers and certain equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements expiring through 2053. The following represents our debt maturities, financings, leases and other contractual commitments as of December 31, 2014 (in thousands): 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Thereafter Total Convertible debt (1) $ — $ 157,885 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 157,885 Senior notes (2) — — — — — 2,750,000 2,750,000 Term loan (2) 40,000 40,000 40,000 40,000 340,000 — 500,000 ALOG financings (2) 13,975 17,199 11,828 6,449 — — 49,451 ALOG loans payable (2) 2,616 2,820 912 912 152 — 7,412 Mortgage payable (2) 1,119 1,168 1,218 1,271 1,326 31,030 37,132 Other loans payable (2) 1,757 — — — — — 1,757 Interest (3) 143,798 163,796 157,354 155,464 154,168 464,191 1,238,771 Capital lease and other financing obligations (4) 113,600 121,710 125,633 129,016 128,736 1,375,393 1,994,088 Operating leases (5) 93,376 93,292 88,575 83,399 77,694 557,004 993,340 Other contractual commitments (6) 248,632 71,060 60,174 2,245 1,349 12,707 396,167 Asset retirement obligations (7) 1,521 526 8,693 3,233 11,076 39,809 64,858 ALOG acquisition contingent considerations (8) 2,242 3,974 — — — — 6,216 $ 662,636 $ 673,430 $ 494,387 $ 421,989 $ 714,501 $ 5,230,134 $ 8,197,077 (1) Represents principal only. As of December 31, 2014, had the holders of the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes due 2016 converted their notes, the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes would have been convertible into approximately 1.9 million shares of our common stock, which would have a total value of $439.4 million based on the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2014. (2) Represents principal only. (3) Represents interest on ALOG financings, convertible debt, mortgage payable, senior notes and term loan facility based on their approximate interest rates as of December 31, 2014. (4) Represents principal and interest. (5) Represents minimum operating lease payments, excluding potential lease renewals. (6) Represents unaccrued contractual commitments. Other contractual commitments are described below. (7) Represents liability, net of future accretion expense. (8) Represents ALOG acquisition contingent consideration, subject to reduction for any post-closing balance sheet adjustments and any claims for indemnification. As of December 31, 2014, we accrued approximately $1,392 of ALOG acquisition contingent consideration. In connection with certain of our leases and other contracts requiring deposits, we entered into 26 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $43.3 million under the revolving credit facility. These letters of credit were provided in lieu of cash deposits under the revolving credit facility. If the landlords for these IBX leases decide to draw down on these letters of credit triggered by an event of default under the lease, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowing under the revolving credit facility. These contingent commitments are not reflected in the table above. We had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaling approximately $25.2 million as of December 31, 2014. These liabilities, which are reflected on our balance sheet, are not reflected in the table above since it is unclear when these liabilities will be paid. Primarily as a result of our various IBX data center expansion projects, as of December 31, 2014, we were contractually committed for $98.1 million of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for IBX equipment not 67 Table of Contents yet delivered and labor not yet provided in connection with the work necessary to complete construction and open these IBX data centers prior to making them available to customers for installation. This amount, which is expected to be paid during 2015 and thereafter, is reflected in the table above as “other contractual commitments.” We had other non-capital purchase commitments in place as of December 31, 2014, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods or services to be delivered or provided during 2015 and beyond. Such other purchase commitments as of December 31, 2014, which total $298.1 million, are also reflected in the table above as “other contractual commitments.” In addition, although we are not contractually obligated to do so, we expect to incur additional capital expenditures of approximately $50 million to $80 million, in addition to the $98.1 million in contractual commitments discussed above as of December 31, 2014, in our various IBX data center expansion projects during 2015 and thereafter in order to complete the work needed to open these IBX data centers. These non-contractual capital expenditures are not reflected in the table above. If we so choose, whether due to economic factors or other considerations, we could delay these non-contractual capital expenditure commitments to preserve liquidity. Other Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements We have various guarantor arrangements with both our directors and officers and third parties, including customers, vendors and business partners. As of December 31, 2014, there were no significant liabilities recorded for these arrangements. For additional information, see “Guarantor Arrangements” in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates, among others, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require significant judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain: • Accounting for income taxes; • Accounting for business combinations; • Accounting for impairment of goodwill; and • Accounting for property, plant and equipment. 68 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid. The accounting standard for income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined by the accounting standard as a likelihood of more than 50%) such assets will not be realized. A tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authority’s widely understood administrative practices and precedents. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future events. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. If, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account a number of types of evidence, including the following: 1) the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, 2) sources of future taxable income and 3) tax planning strategies. In assessing the tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position, the tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recorded a total of net deferred tax liabilities of $100.8 million and net deferred tax assets of $95.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had a total valuation allowance of $27.2 million and $31.1 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we decided to provide a partial release of valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets associated with certain foreign operating entities, which resulted in an insignificant income tax benefit in our results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we decided to provide a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets associated with certain foreign operating entities which resulted in an insignificant income tax expense in our results of operations. Our decisions to release our valuation allowances were based on our belief that the operations of these jurisdictions had achieved a sufficient level of profitability and will sustain a sufficient level of profitability in the future to support the release of these valuation allowances based on relevant facts and circumstances. However, if our assumptions on the future performance of these jurisdictions prove not to be correct and these jurisdictions are not able to sustain a sufficient level of profitability to support the associated deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet, we will have to impair our deferred tax assets through an additional valuation allowance, which would impact our financial position and results of operations in the period such a determination is made. Our remaining valuation allowance as of December 31, 2014 was $27.2 million and primarily relates to certain of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. If and when we release our remaining valuation allowances, it will have a favorable impact to our financial position and results of operations in the periods such determinations are made. We will continue to assess the need for our valuation allowances, by country or location, in the future. 69 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $36.1 million and $36.6 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the unrecognized tax benefits decreased by an insignificant amount primarily due to the settlement of a tax audit and the lapse of statute of limitations in our foreign operations. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the unrecognized tax benefits increased by $11.6 million primarily due to losses of certain foreign operating entities, which more likely than not, will not benefit the operating entities. The unrecognized tax benefits of $36.1 million as of December 31, 2014, if subsequently recognized, will affect our effective tax rate favorably at the time when such benefits are recognized. Accounting for Business Combinations In accordance with the accounting standard for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as customer contracts, leases and any other significant assets or liabilities and contingent consideration. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date if we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed. Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires assumptions and management’s judgment to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. During the last three years, we have completed several business combinations, including the Frankfurt Kleyer 90 Carrier Hotel acquisition in October 2013, the Dubai IBX data center acquisition in November 2012, and the Asia Tone and ancotel acquisitions in July 2012. The purchase price allocation for the Asia Tone and ancotel acquisitions was completed in the third quarter of 2012. The purchase price allocation for the Dubai IBX data center and Frankfurt Kleyer 90 Carrier Hotel acquisitions was completed in the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2013, respectively. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we used to complete the purchase price allocations and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, which would be recorded in our statements of operations in 2015 or beyond. 70 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions Accounting for Impairment of Goodwill In accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform goodwill impairment reviews annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from November 30th to October 31st of each year, commencing on October 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we completed annual goodwill impairment reviews of the Americas reporting unit, the EMEA reporting unit and the Asia-Pacific reporting unit and concluded that there was no impairment as the fair value of these reporting units exceeded their carrying value. When we elect to assess qualitative factors determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value requires assumptions and estimates before performing the two-step goodwill impairment test, the assessment requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. When we elect to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test, we use both the income and market approach. Under the income approach, we develop a five-year cash flow forecast and use our weighted-average cost of capital applicable to our reporting units as discount rates. This requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. The market approach requires judgment in determining the appropriate market comparables. These assumptions require significant management judgment and are inherently subject to uncertainties. As of December 31, 2014, goodwill attributable to the Americas reporting unit, the EMEA reporting unit and the Asia-Pacific reporting unit was $463.9 million, $404.1 million and $134.1 million, respectively. Future events, changing market conditions and any changes in key assumptions may result in an impairment charge. While we have not recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill to date, the development of adverse business conditions in our Americas, EMEA or Asia-Pacific reporting units, such as higher than anticipated customer churn or significantly increased operating costs, or significant deterioration of our market comparables that we use in the market approach, could result in an impairment charge in future periods. Any potential impairment charge against our goodwill would not exceed the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Accounting for Property, Plant and Equipment We have a substantial amount of property, plant and equipment recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The vast majority of our property, plant and equipment represent the costs incurred to build out or acquire our IBX data centers. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets. The majority of our IBX data centers are in properties that are leased. We depreciate our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (subject to the term of the lease in the case of leased assets or leasehold improvements). Accounting for property, plant and equipment includes determining the appropriate period in which to While there are numerous judgments and uncertainties involved in accounting for property, plant and equipment that are significant, arriving at the estimated useful life of an asset requires the most critical judgment for us and changes to these estimates would have the most significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. When we lease a property for our IBX data centers, we generally enter into long-term arrangements with initial lease terms of at least 8-10 years and with renewal options generally available to us. During the next several years, a number of leases for our IBX data centers will come up for renewal. As we start approaching the end of these initial lease terms, we will need to reassess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment. In addition, we During the quarter ended December 31, 2014, we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment. As a result, we recorded an insignificant amount of higher depreciation expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 due to the reduction of the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment. We undertook this review due to our determination that we were generally using certain of our existing assets over a shorter period than originally anticipated and, therefore, the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment has been shortened. This change was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis effective October 1, 2014 under the accounting standard for change in accounting 71 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions depreciate such assets, making assessments for leased properties to determine whether they are capital or operating leases, assessing such assets for potential impairment, capitalizing interest during periods of construction and assessing the asset retirement obligations required for certain leased properties that require us to return the leased properties back to their original condition at the time we decide to exit a leased property. may find that our estimates for the useful lives of non-leased assets may also need to be revised periodically. We periodically review the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment and changes in these estimates in the future are possible. Another area of judgment for us in connection with our property, plant and equipment is related to lease accounting. Most of our IBX data centers are leased. Each time we enter into a new lease or lease amendment for one of our IBX data centers, we analyze each lease or lease amendment for the proper accounting. This requires certain judgments on our part such as establishing the lease term to include in a lease test, establishing the remaining estimated useful life of the underlying property or equipment and estimating the fair value of the underlying property or equipment and establishing the incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payment for the lease test. All of these judgments are inherently uncertain. Different assumptions or estimates could result in a different accounting treatment for a lease. The assessment of long-lived assets for impairment requires assumptions and estimates of undiscounted and discounted future cash flows. These assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and are inherently uncertain. estimates. We did not revise the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2013. During the quarter ended December 31, 2012, we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment. As a result, we recorded approximately $5.0 million of lower depreciation expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2012 due to extending the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment. We undertook this review due to our determination that we were generally using certain of our existing assets longer than originally anticipated and, therefore, the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment has been lengthened. This change was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis effective October 1, 2012 under the accounting standard for change in accounting estimates. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded impairment charges totaling $9.9 million associated with certain long-lived assets, of which $7.0 million was associated with property, plant and equipment. No impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. As of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we had property, plant and equipment of $5.0 billion, $4.6 billion, and $3.9 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded depreciation expense of $453.9 million, $405.5 million, and $367.0 million, respectively. Further changes in our estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment could have a significant impact on our results of operations. As of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we had property, plant and equipment under capital leases and other financing obligations of $1,139.4 million, $949.0 million and $555.7 million. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded depreciation expense of $43.2 million, $32.5 million, and $18.8 72 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ FromAssumptions million respectively, related to property, plant and equipment under capital leases and other financing obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2014, 2013, 2012, we recorded interest expense of $86.4 million, $56.6 million, $31.8 million, respectively related to property, plant, equipment, under capital leases and other financing obligations. Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded rent expense of $105.4 million $112.7 million, and $113.3 million under operating leases. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk The following discussion about market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity. We employ foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging certain specifically-identified exposures. The use of these financial instruments is intended to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, but does not eliminate such risks. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Investment Portfolio Risk We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities that is prioritized on meeting REIT asset requirements. All of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale and, therefore, are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax. We consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge for our securities, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. We anticipate that we will recover the entire cost basis of these securities and have determined that no other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were required to be recognized during the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market fund investments, U.S. government and agency obligations and certificates of deposits. Excluding the U.S. government holdings, which carry a lower risk and lower return in comparison to other securities in the portfolio, the remaining amount in our investment portfolio that could be susceptible to market risk totaled $403.4 million. 73 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk which meets asset measurement requirements for REIT qualification. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates or credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Securities with longer maturities are subject to a greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities. As of December 31, 2014, the average duration of our portfolio was less than one year. An immediate hypothetical shift in the yield curves of plus or minus 50 basis points from their position as of December 31, 2014 could decrease or increase the fair value of our investment portfolio by approximately $0.8 million to $1.8 million. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift of all interest rates, however, interest rates do not always move in such a manner and actual results may differ materially. We monitor our interest rate and credit risk, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers. There were no impairment charges on our cash equivalents and fixed income securities during the year ended December 31, 2014. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates from their position as of December 31, 2014 would not have a material impact on our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of the majority of our debt obligations. However, the interest expense associated with our senior credit facility and ALOG financings, which bear interest at variable rates could be affected. For every 100 basis point change in interest rates, our annual interest expense could increase or decrease by a total of approximately $5.5 million based on the total balance of our primary borrowings under the term loan facility and the ALOG financings as of December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, we had not employed any interest rate derivative products to help manage our debt obligations. However, we may enter into interest rate hedging agreements in the future to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk. The fair value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate changes may affect the fair value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair value of our convertible debt, which is traded in the market, is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of our loans payable, which are not traded in the market, is estimated by considering our credit rating, current rates available to us for debt of the same remaining maturities and the terms of the debt. The following table represents the carrying value and estimated fair value of our loans payable, senior notes and convertible debt as of (in thousands): December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 CarryingValue Fair Value CarryingValue Fair Value Mortgage and loans payable $ 594,152 $ 553,045 $ 253,208 $ 254,607 Convertible debt 145,853 162,159 724,202 1,009,744 Senior notes 2,750,000 2,790,023 2,250,000 2,302,290 Foreign Currency Risk A significant portion of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, however, approximately 49% of our revenues and 49% of our operating costs are attributable to Brazil, Canada and the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions and a large portion of those revenues and costs are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Brazilian Reais, Canadian dollar, British pound, Euro, Swiss franc, United Arab Emirates dirham, Australian dollar, Chinese Yuan, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar. As a result, our operating results and cash flows are impacted by currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. To protect against certain reductions in value caused by changes in currency exchange rates, we have established a risk management program to offset some of the risk of carrying assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. We entered into foreign currency forward contracts to help manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for forecasted revenues and 74 Table of Contents expenses in our EMEA region. Our risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements and its impact on the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2014, the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of less than two years. For the foreseeable future, we anticipate that approximately 50% of our revenues and operating costs will continue to be generated and incurred outside of the U.S. in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. During fiscal 2014, the U.S. dollar was generally strong relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate. This overall strength of the U.S. dollar had a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations because the foreign denominations translated into less U.S. dollars. In future periods, the volatility of the U.S. dollar as compared to the other currencies in which we do business could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations including the amount of revenue that we report in future periods. Excluding consideration from hedging contracts, an immediate 10% appreciation in current foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2014 would have resulted in an increase of $121.7 million and $25.5 million in revenue and net income before taxes. Excluding consideration from hedging contracts, an immediate 10% depreciation in current foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2014 would have resulted in a decrease of $115.8 million and $16.0 million in revenue and net income before taxes. We may enter into additional hedging activities in the future to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency risk as our exposure to foreign currency risk continues to increase due to our growing foreign operations; however, we do not currently intend to eliminate all foreign currency transaction exposure. Commodity Price Risk Certain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of price changes are electricity, supplies and equipment used in our IBX data centers. We closely monitor the cost of electricity at all of our locations. We have entered into several power contracts to purchase power at fixed prices during 2014 and beyond in certain locations in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom. In addition, as we are building new, or expanding existing, IBX data centers, we are subject to commodity price risk for building materials related to the construction of these IBX data centers, such as steel and copper. In addition, the lead-time to procure certain pieces of equipment, such as generators, is substantial. Any delays in procuring the necessary pieces of equipment for the construction of our IBX data centers could delay the anticipated openings of these new IBX data centers and, as a result, increase the cost of these projects. We do not currently employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to address commodity price risk other than the power contracts discussed above.",2023-12-30 20:28:20.694067
1101239,EQIX,EQUINIX INC,2016,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information in this discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements are based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. For example, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist readers in understanding our financial information from our management’s perspective and is presented as follows:•Overview•Results of Operations•Non-GAAP Financial Measures•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements•Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates•Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn December 2015, as more fully described in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we issued $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior notes due January 15, 2026 (the “2026 Senior Notes”).In December 2015, as more fully described in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we entered into the second amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to our Senior Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, our revolving credit facility was increased by $500.0 million to $1.5 billion and we received commitments for an additional $250.0 million seven-year term loan facility and for an additional £300.0 million, or approximately $442.0 million in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2015, seven-year term loan (collectively, the “Term Loan B Commitments”). We borrowed the full amount of the Term Loan B Commitments in January 2016.In November 2015, as more fully described in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we issued and sold 2,994,792 shares of our common stock in a public offering. We received net proceeds of approximately $829.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.We intend to use the net proceeds we received from the sale of our 2026 Senior Notes and from the sale of our common stock, as well as the net proceeds we received in January 2016 from our Term Loan B Commitments, for both merger and acquisition activities and general corporate purposes.In November 2015, as more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed our acquisition of Tokyo-based Bit-isle Inc. (“Bit-isle”) valued at ¥33.2 billion or approximately $275.4 million U.S. dollars. In connection with our acquisition of Bit-isle, as more fully described in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in September 2015 we entered into a term loan agreement (the “Bridge Term Loan Agreement”) with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (“BTMU”). BTMU has committed to provide a senior bridge loan facility (the “Bridge Term Loan”) in the amount of up to ¥47.5 billion, or approximately $395.2 million at the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2015. Proceeds from the Bridge Term Loan are to be used exclusively for the acquisition of Bit-isle, the repayment of Bit-isle’s existing debt and transaction costs incurred in connection with the closing of the Bridge Term Loan and the acquisition of Bit-isle. We borrowed ¥46.5 billion, or approximately $386.5 million in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2015, under the Bridge Term Loan in the fourth quarter of 2015. We intend to obtain permanent financing to replace and terminate the Bridge Term Loan in 2016.40Table of ContentsIn May 2015, as more fully described in Note 2 and Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we announced an offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of TelecityGroup, valued at approximately £2.4 billion, or $3.8 billion in U.S. dollars. The transaction closed in January 2016. The total consideration consisted of $1.7 billion in cash and 6.9 million shares of our common stock, valued at $2.1 billion. In connection with the transaction, we also entered into a bridge credit agreement (the ""Bridge Loan"") with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMCB”) as the initial lender and as administrative agent for the lenders (the “Lenders”), for a principal amount of £875.0 million; or approximately $1.3 billion. The Bridge Loan was dedicated solely for the acquisition of TelecityGroup and to satisfy funds certain requirements under UK takeover code. We terminated the Bridge Loan in January 2016.In May 2015, we received a favorable response to the PLR request we had submitted to the IRS in connection with our conversion to a REIT for federal income tax purposes effective for the taxable year commencing January 1, 2015.In April 2015, as more fully described in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we entered into the first amendment (the “First Amendment”) of our credit agreement dated December 17, 2014 (the “Senior Credit Facility”). The amendment allowed for the conversion of the outstanding U.S. dollar-denominated principal amount of the term loan facility to an approximately equivalent amount denominated in four foreign currencies. In connection with the execution of the amendment, on April 30, 2015, we repaid the U.S. dollar-denominated $490.0 million remaining principal balance of the term loan facility and immediately re-borrowed under the term loan facility the aggregate principal amount of CHF 47.8 million, €184.9 million, £92.6 million and ¥11.9 million, or approximately $490.0 million in U.S dollars in total.Overview Equinix provides global data center offerings that protect and connect the world’s most valued information assets. Global enterprises, financial services companies and content and network service providers rely upon Equinix’s leading insight and data centers in 33 markets around the world for the safekeeping of their critical IT equipment and the ability to directly connect to the networks that enable today’s information-driven economy. Equinix offers the following solutions: (i) premium data center colocation, (ii) interconnection and (iii) exchange and outsourced IT infrastructure services. As of December 31, 2015, we operated or had partner International Business Exchange (“IBX”) data centers in the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Seattle, Silicon Valley, Toronto and Washington, D.C. metro areas in the Americas region; France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) region; and Australia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan and Singapore in the Asia-Pacific region. Our data centers in 33 markets around the world are a global platform, which allows our customers to increase information and application delivery performance while significantly reducing costs. This global platform and the quality of our IBX data centers have enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. As more customers choose our IBX data centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate with us as well, in order to gain the full economic and performance benefits of our offerings. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a “marketplace” for their services. Our global platform enables scalable, reliable and cost-effective colocation, interconnection and traffic exchange that lowers overall cost and increases flexibility. Our focused business model is built on our critical mass of customers and the resulting “marketplace” effect. This global platform, combined with our strong financial position, continues to drive new customer growth and bookings. Historically, our market has been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled telecommunications products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include cloud computing/utility providers, application hosting providers and systems integrators, managed infrastructure hosting providers and colocation providers. More than 350 companies provide data center solutions in the U.S. alone. Each of these data center solutions providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings, and outsourced IT infrastructure services. We are able to offer our customers a global platform that reaches 21 countries with proven operational reliability, improved application performance and network choice, and a highly scalable set of offerings.Our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus net sellable cabinet space available, taking into account power limitations. Our utilization rate was approximately 81% and 78% as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. However, excluding the impact of IBX data center expansion projects that have opened during the last 12 months, our utilization rate would be approximately 85% as of December 31, 2015. Our utilization rate varies from market to market among our IBX data centers across the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers 41Table of Contentsare consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain high power-demand customers. This increased power consumption has driven us to build out our new IBX data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX data centers. We could face power limitations in our IBX data centers, even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific IBX data center. This could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given IBX data center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows. Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and offerings. As was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors, such as demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to break even on a free cash flow basis, and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. Depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to Equinix standards. Property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant.Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related interconnection and managed infrastructure offerings. We consider these offerings recurring because our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. In addition, during any given quarter of the past three years, more than half of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 3% of our recurring revenues for the period ended December 31, 2015 and 2% of our recurring revenues for the periods ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Our 50 largest customers accounted for approximately 34%, 36% and 35% of our recurring revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer’s initial deployment and professional services that we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring because they are billed typically once, upon completion of the installation or the professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. However, revenues from installation services are deferred and recognized ratably over the expected life of the customer installation. Additionally, revenue from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is recognized when no remaining performance obligations exist and collectability is reasonably assured, to the extent that the revenue has not previously been recognized. As a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future. Our Americas revenues are derived primarily from colocation and related interconnection offerings, and our EMEA and Asia-Pacific revenues are derived primarily from colocation and managed infrastructure offerings. The largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX data centers, utility costs, including electricity and bandwidth, IBX data center employees’ salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment and security services. A substantial majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing IBX data centers or open or acquire new IBX data centers. However, there are certain costs that are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. We expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will generally increase in the future on a per-unit or fixed basis, in addition to the variable increase related to the growth in consumption by our customers. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months, as compared to other times of the year. To the extent we incur increased utility costs, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, to the extent we incur increased electricity costs as a result of either climate change policies or the physical effects of climate change, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer contract intangible assets.42Table of ContentsGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees, and other general corporate expenses, such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and some depreciation expense.Due to our recurring revenue model, and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature and generally does not grow in proportion to revenue growth, we expect our cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses to decline as a percentage of revenues over time, although we expect each of them to grow in absolute dollars in connection with our growth. However, for cost of revenues, this trend may periodically be impacted when a large expansion project opens or is acquired, and before it starts generating any meaningful revenue. Furthermore, in relation to cost of revenues, we note that the Americas region has a lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue than either EMEA or Asia-Pacific. This is due to both the increased scale and maturity of the Americas region, compared to either the EMEA or Asia-Pacific region, as well as a higher cost structure outside of the Americas, particularly in EMEA. While we expect all three regions to continue to see lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in future periods, we expect the trend that sees the Americas having the lowest cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to continue. As a result, to the extent that revenue growth outside the Americas grows in greater proportion than revenue growth in the Americas, our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may increase in future periods. Sales and marketing expenses may periodically increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to scale our operations to invest in sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue, including the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovations. General and administrative expenses may also periodically increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth.Real Estate Investment Trust Conversion We began operating as a REIT for federal income tax purposes effective January 1, 2015. In May 2015, we received a favorable PLR from the IRS in connection with our conversion to a REIT. As of December 31, 2015, our REIT structure includes all of our data center operations in the U.S., Canada, Europe and the historical data center operations in Japan. Our data center operations in other jurisdictions, as well as the data center operations acquired in the Bit-isle Acquisition, have initially been designated as TRSs. As a REIT, we generally are permitted to deduct from federal taxable income the dividends we pay to our stockholders (including, for this purpose, the value of any deemed distribution on account of adjustments to the conversion rate relating to our outstanding debt securities that are convertible into our common stock). The income represented by such dividends is not subject to federal taxation at the entity level but is taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. Nevertheless, the income of our TRSs which hold our U.S. operations that may not be REIT-compliant, are subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income tax. Likewise, our foreign subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through TRSs or through QRSs. We are also subject to a separate corporate income tax on gain recognized from a sale of a REIT asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a present or former C corporation (such as (i) an asset that we held as of the effective date of our REIT election, that is, January 1, 2015 or (ii) an asset that we hold in a QRS following the liquidation or other conversion of a former TRS). This built-in-gains tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a REIT asset (e.g., January 1, 2015 in the case of REIT assets we held at the time of our REIT conversion), to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a REIT asset. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Even if we remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our TRSs' operations. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the federal income tax regime for REITs, many states do not completely follow federal rules and some may not follow them at all. We incurred a total of approximately $364.0 million in tax liabilities associated with a change in our methods of depreciating and amortizing various data center assets for tax purposes from our prior methods to methods that are more consistent with the characterization of such assets as real property for REIT purposes. These liabilities were generally payable over a four-year period starting in 2012.On September 28, 2015, we announced the declaration by our Board of Directors of a special distribution (the “2015 Special Distribution”) of $627.0 million on our shares of common stock, payable in either common stock or cash to, and at the election of, our stockholders of record as of October 8, 2015 (the “Record Date”). The 2015 Special Distribution included: (1) foreign earnings and profits repatriated as dividend income recognized in 2015; (2) taxable income in 2015 from depreciation recapture in respect of accounting method changes commenced in our pre-REIT period; and (3) certain other items of taxable income. The 2015 Special Distribution was paid on November 10, 2015 to our common stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 8, 2015 in the form of an aggregate of approximately $125.5 million in cash and 1.69 million shares of our common stock. 43Table of ContentsThe 2015 Special Distribution followed an initial special distribution of $416.0 million paid in cash and common stock to stockholders in November 2014.In connection with our conversion to a REIT effective January 1, 2015, we also paid quarterly cash dividends of $1.69 per share on each of March 25, 2015, June 17, 2015, September 16, 2015, and December 16, 2015. The amount of the 2015 Special Distribution, plus the amount of all of our other distributions during 2015 and the value of the deemed distributions on account of the adjustments to the conversion rate relating to our outstanding 4.75% convertible subordinated notes that were made as a result of all our 2015 distributions, equaled or exceeded the taxable income that we recognized in 2015.We have initially designated all the legal entities acquired in the Bit-isle acquisition as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”), which we believe will not impact our qualification for taxation as a REIT. We plan to integrate the data center business of Bit-isle into our REIT structure by the end of 2016.We will initially designate all the legal entities acquired in the TelecityGroup acquisition as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”), which we believe will not impact our qualification for taxation as a REIT. We plan to integrate a significant portion of the TelecityGroup businesses into our REIT structure by the end of 2016 and to complete almost all remaining REIT integration efforts in the first half of 2017. We continue to monitor our REIT compliance to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT. For this, and other reasons, as necessary, we may convert certain of our data center operations in additional countries into the REIT in future periods.Results of OperationsOur results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 include the results of operations of the Nimbo and Bit-isle acquisitions from January 15, 2015 and November 2, 2015 respectively. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 include the operations of Frankfurt Kleyer 90 carrier hotel acquisition from October 1, 2013.Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2015 % 2014 % Actual Constant currencyAmericas: Recurring revenues$1,432,084 52% $1,311,518 54% 9% 12%Non-recurring revenues80,451 3% 64,585 3% 25% 25% 1,512,535 55% 1,376,103 57% 10% 13%EMEA: Recurring revenues651,778 24% 598,953 24% 9% 23%Non-recurring revenues47,029 2% 38,312 1% 23% 41% 698,807 26% 637,265 25% 10% 24%Asia-Pacific: Recurring revenues485,279 18% 407,319 17% 19% 31%Non-recurring revenues29,246 1% 23,089 1% 27% 39% 514,525 19% 430,408 18% 20% 31%Total: Recurring revenues2,569,141 94% 2,317,790 95% 11% 18%Non-recurring revenues156,726 6% 125,986 5% 24% 32% $2,725,867 100% $2,443,776 100% 12% 19%44Table of ContentsAmericas Revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our revenues from the United States, the largest revenue contributor in the Americas region for the periods, represented approximately 93% and 91%, respectively, of the regional revenues. Growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to (i) $44.5 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers and IBX data center expansions in the Dallas, New York, Rio de Janeiro, Silicon Valley, Toronto and Washington DC metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers.. During the year ended December 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $37.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Americas revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. We expect that our Americas revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in the recently-opened IBX data centers and additional IBX data center expansions currently taking place in the Atlanta, Sao Paulo and Washington, D.C. metro areas, which are expected to open during 2016 and 2017. Our estimates of future revenue growth also take into account expected changes in recurring revenues attributed to customer bookings, customer churn or changes or amendments to customers’ contracts.EMEA Revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our revenues from the United Kingdom, the largest revenue contributor in the EMEA region for the periods, represented approximately 37% and 36%, respectively, of the regional revenues. Our EMEA revenue growth was due to (i) $23.6 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers and IBX data center expansions in the Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, and Paris metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. During the year ended December 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $94.1 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound and Euro during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. We expect that our EMEA revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in recently-opened IBX data centers and additional IBX data center expansions currently taking place in the Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London metro areas, which are expected to open during 2016 and 2017, and as a result of our acquisition of TelecityGroup, which closed in January 2016. Our estimates of future revenue growth also take into account expected changes in recurring revenues attributed to customer bookings, customer churn or changes or amendments to customers' contracts.Asia-Pacific Revenues. Our revenues from Singapore, the largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, represented approximately 37% and 38% of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Our Asia-Pacific revenue growth was due to (i) $58.8 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers and IBX data center expansions in the Hong Kong, Melbourne, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. In addition, our Asia-Pacific revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $21.6 million of revenue attributable to our acquisition of Bit-isle, which closed on November 2, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $46.4 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Asia-Pacific revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. We expect that our Asia-Pacific revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in these recently-opened IBX data center expansions and additional expansions currently taking place in the Hong Kong, Sydney, and Tokyo metro areas, which are expected to open during 2016 and 2017, and as a result of our acquisition of Bit-isle. Our estimates of future revenue growth also take into account expected changes in recurring revenues attributed to customer bookings, customer churn or changes or amendments to customers’ contracts.45Table of ContentsCost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2015 % 2014 % Actual Constant currencyAmericas$637,604 49% $605,184 51% 5% 10%EMEA350,270 27% 337,095 28% 4% 19%Asia-Pacific303,632 24% 255,606 21% 19% 30%Total$1,291,506 100% $1,197,885 100% 8% 17% Years ended December 31, 2015 2014Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues: Americas42% 44%EMEA50% 53%Asia-Pacific59% 59%Total47% 49%Americas Cost of Revenues. Our Americas cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 included $219.1 million and $218.4 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. The increase in our Americas cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $17.4 million of higher office expense, utilities, and repair and maintenance costs in support of our business growth, (ii) $7.3 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (1,032 employees included in Americas cost of revenues as of December 31, 2015 versus 941 as of December 31, 2014), (iii) $3.9 million of higher costs associated with equipment resales to support the growth of non-recurring revenues and (iv) $3.5 million of higher property and real property tax expenses primarily due to our newly-opened IBX data centers during the year ended December 31, 2015, partially offset by $2.6 million of lower rent and facility costs primarily as a result of certain leases being accounted for as capital leases rather than as operating leases. During the year ended December 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $29.6 million of net favorable foreign currency impact on our Americas cost of revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. We expect Americas cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business.EMEA Cost of Revenues. EMEA cost of revenues included $97.8 million of depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The increase in our EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to $3.4 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (541 employees included in EMEA cost of revenues as of December 31, 2015 versus 473 as of December 31, 2014), and $13.2 million of higher costs associated with equipment resales, bandwidth and other customer services in support of our non-recurring revenues growth as well as an increase in net losses related to cash flow derivatives. These increases were partially offset by $5.0 million of lower rent, facilities and utilities expenses and $2.7 million of lower consulting costs. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $50.8 million of net favorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA cost of revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound and Euro during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. We expect EMEA cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business and as a result of our acquisition of TelecityGroup, which closed in January 2016.Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $17.4 million of cost of revenues attributable to our acquisition of Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015. Excluding cost of revenues attributable to Bit-isle, Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $286.2 million compared to $255.6 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Depreciation expense, excluding Bit-isle, was $116.9 million and $101.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX data center expansion activity. In addition to the increase in depreciation expense, the increase in Asia-Pacific cost of revenues, excluding cost of revenues attributable to Bit-isle, was primarily due to $9.9 million in higher consulting costs, utility costs, repairs and maintenance costs and rent and facility costs in support of our revenue growth as well as $2.8 million of higher compensation 46Table of Contentscosts, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (390 employees included in Asia-Pacific cost of revenues, excluding Bit-isle employees, as of December 31, 2015 versus 342 as of December 31, 2014). During the year ended December 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $24.7 million of net favorable foreign currency impact on our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. We expect Asia-Pacific cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business and as a result of our acquisition of Bit-isle.Sales and Marketing Expenses.

The increase in our Americas sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to (i) $26.5 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, commission and stock-based compensation as a result of business and headcount growth (497 Americas sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2015 versus 450 as of December 31, 2014) and (ii) $8.6 million of higher travel, consulting and advertising and promotion costs in support of our business growth. During the year ended December 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.7 million of net favorable foreign currency impact on our Americas sales and marketing expenses primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our Americas sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts. Although we anticipate that we will continue to invest in Americas sales and marketing initiatives, we believe our Americas sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues will remain at approximately current levels over the next year or two but should ultimately decrease as we continue to grow our business.EMEA Sales and Marketing Expenses. The decrease in our EMEA sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $4.5 million of lower professional fees primarily due to the termination of certain contracts during 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $8.3 million of net favorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA sales and marketing expenses primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound and Euro compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our EMEA sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts and, as a result, our EMEA sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues have increased.

Although we anticipate that we will continue to invest in EMEA sales and marketing initiatives, including the integration of TelecityGroup, we believe our EMEA sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues will ultimately decrease as we continue to grow our business beyond 2016. 47Table of ContentsAsia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $2.2 million of sales and marketing expenses attributable to our acquisition of Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015. Excluding Bit-isle, Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses were $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $43.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses, excluding Bit-isle, was primarily due to $3.6 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, commission and stock-based compensation as a result of business and headcount growth (183 Asia-Pacific sales and marketing employees, excluding Bit-isle employees, versus 155 as of December 31, 2014).

Over the past several years, we have been investing in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts and, as a result, our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses have increased. We expect our APAC sales and marketing expenses to further increase as a result of the Bit-Isle acquisition. Although we anticipate that we will continue to invest in Asia-Pacific sales and marketing initiatives, including the integration of Bit-isle, we believe our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues will ultimately decrease as we continue to grow our business.General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2015 % 2014 % Actual Constant currencyAmericas$347,421 70% $315,533 72% 10% 11%EMEA92,803 19% 79,942 18% 16% 26%Asia-Pacific53,060 11% 42,541 10% 25% 35%Total$493,284 100% $438,016 100% 13% 16% Years ended December 31, 2015 2014General and Administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues: Americas23% 23%EMEA13% 13%Asia-Pacific10% 10%Total18% 18%Americas General and Administrative Expenses.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $3.2 million of net favorable foreign currency impact on our Americas general and administrative expenses primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Over the course of the past year, we have been investing in our Americas general and administrative functions to scale this region effectively for growth, which has included additional investments into improving our back office systems. We expect our current efforts to improve our back office systems will continue over the next several years. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect Americas general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to further scale our operations to support our growth, including these investments in our back office systems and maintaining our REIT qualification.EMEA General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our EMEA general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) approximately $4.2 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based 48Table of Contentscompensation as a result of headcount growth (420 EMEA general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2015 versus 353 as of December 31, 2014), (ii) $4.3 million of higher depreciation expenses due to implementation of the Oracle R12 ERP system and certain systems to support the REIT conversion and (iii) $2.8 million of higher consulting costs primarily due to integration efforts in connection with our acquisition of TelecityGroup as well as an increase in net losses related to cash flow hedging derivatives.

Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect our EMEA general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as a result of our acquisition of TelecityGroup and as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth; however, as a percentage of revenues, we generally expect them to decrease. Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $5.8 million of general and administrative expenses attributable to our acquisition of Bit-isle, which closed on November 2, 2015. Excluding general and administrative expenses attributable to Bit-isle, Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $47.3 million compared to $42.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding general and administrative expenses attributable to Bit-isle, the increase in our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a $2.2 million increase in consulting costs, legal fees and other costs for tax-related matters as well as higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation as a result of headcount growth (266 Asia-Pacific general and administrative employees, excluding Bit-isle employees, as of December 31, 2015 versus 224 as of December 31, 2014). During the year ended December 31, 2015, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $3.4 million of net favorable impact on our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses to increase as a result of our acquisition of Bit-isle and as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth; however, as a percentage of revenues, we generally expect them to decrease.Acquisition Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $41.7 million primarily attributed to the EMEA region, and to a lesser degree, to the Asia-Pacific region. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $2.5 million primarily attributed to the EMEA region.Income from Operations. Our income from operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2015 % 2014 % Actual Constant currencyAmericas$324,458 57% $282,219 56% 15% 15%EMEA145,527 26% 138,685 27% 5% 23%Asia-Pacific97,357 17% 88,362 17% 10% 24%Total$567,342 100% $509,266 100% 11% 19%Americas Income from Operations. The increase in our Americas income from operations was due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation and other headcount related expenses to support our growth. EMEA Income from Operations. The increase in our EMEA income from operations was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above. During the year ended December 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $25.6 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA income from operations primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pounds and Euro during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.Asia-Pacific Income from Operations. The increase in our Asia-Pacific income from operations was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation and other headcount related expenses and higher professional fees to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $17.5 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Asia-Pacific income from operations primarily 49Table of Contentsdue to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.Interest Income. Interest income was $3.6 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 0.38% versus 0.33% for the year ended December 31, 2014. We expect our interest income to remain at these low levels for the foreseeable future due to the impact of a continued low interest rate environment and a portfolio more weighted towards short-term securities and U.S. government securities in order to satisfy REIT compliance requirements.Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $299.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $270.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase in interest expense was primarily due to the full impact recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015 of our $1.25 billion of senior notes issued in November 2014, the $0.5 billion Term loan A we borrowed in December 2014 under our senior credit facility and $18 million of higher interest expense from various capital lease and other financing obligations to support our expansion projects, which was partially offset by the redemption of our 7.00% senior notes in December 2014, the settlement of the 3.00% convertible notes and the partial redemption of the 4.75% convertible notes in June 2014. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we capitalized $10.9 million and $19.0 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. Going forward, we expect to incur higher interest expense as we recognize the full impact of our $1.1 billion of senior notes issued in December 2015 and the full impact of financing our acquisition of Bit-isle as well as the impact of approximately $0.7 billion of borrowings under our Term loan B commitments under our senior credit facility that we completed in January 2016. We may also incur additional indebtedness to support our growth, resulting in higher interest expense.Other Income (Expense). We recorded net expense of $60.6 million and net income of $0.1 million for the years December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains and losses during the periods. The expense recorded in 2015 is primarily attributed to foreign currency losses to fund the TelecityGroup acquisition purchase price.Loss on Debt Extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a $0.3 million loss on debt extinguishment which was attributable to partial conversions of our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes in December 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a $157.0 million loss on debt extinguishment, of which $51.2 million was attributable to the exchanges of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes and 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, $103.3 million was attributable to the redemption of our $750.0 million 7.00% senior notes and $2.5 million was attributable to the prepayment and termination of our $750.0 million multicurrency credit facility. For additional information, see “Loss on Debt Extinguishment” in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Income Taxes. Effective January 1, 2015, we have operated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are generally not subject to U.S. income taxes on taxable income distributed to our stockholders. We distributed the entire taxable income generated by the operations of our REIT and its QRSs for the tax year ending December 31, 2015. As such, no provision for U.S. federal income taxes for the REIT and its QRSs has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. We have made TRS elections for some of our subsidiaries in and outside the U.S. In general, a TRS may provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs to provide and may hold assets that REITs cannot hold directly. U.S. income taxes for the TRS entities located in the U.S. and foreign income taxes for our foreign operations regardless of whether the foreign operations are operated as a QRS or TRS were accrued, as necessary, for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded $23.2 million and $345.5 million of income tax expenses, respectively. We recognized a significantly lower income tax provision in 2015 as compared to the income tax provision in 2014 primarily due to the de-recognition, in 2014, of the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our U.S. operations upon conversion to a REIT. As a REIT, we are entitled to a deduction for dividends paid, resulting in a substantial reduction of U.S. income tax expense. Substantially all of our income tax expense for 2015 is for foreign income taxes incurred by our foreign subsidiaries and U.S. income tax incurred by our U.S. TRSs.The $345.5 million of income tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to the statutory tax rate change due to our REIT conversion, which resulted in a $324.1 million domestic deferred tax assets write-off. In connection with the formal approval of our conversion to a REIT by our Board of Directors in December 2014, we reassessed, in the fourth quarter of 2014, the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our U.S. operations to be included in the REIT structure. The reevaluation resulted in de-recognizing the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our REIT’s U.S. operations, excluding the deferred tax liabilities associated with the depreciation and amortization recapture expected in 2015. The de-recognition of the deferred tax 50Table of Contentsassets and liabilities of our REIT’s U.S. operations occurred because the expected recovery or settlement of the related assets and liabilities will not result in deductible or taxable amounts in any post-REIT conversion periods. The deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with our foreign operations, regardless of whether such foreign operations were part of the REIT conversion, are not subject to the de-recognition assessment. We generally do not expect our occasional sale of assets to result in a material tax liability.Our effective tax rates were 11.0% and 407.7%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to tax expense attributable to the $324.1 million domestic deferred tax assets write-off as a result of our REIT conversion. Excluding this tax expense, our effective tax rate would have been 25.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Due to our REIT conversion, we are entitled to a deduction for dividends paid, which results in a substantial reduction of U.S income tax expense. As a REIT, substantially all of our income tax expense is the foreign income tax incurred by our foreign subsidiaries and the U.S. income tax expense incurred by our U.S. TRSs. Assuming no material changes to tax rules and regulations, as a REIT we expect our effective long-term world-wide cash tax rate to remain in the range of 10% to 15%.We recorded excess income tax benefits of $30,000 and $18.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets.Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a key factor in how we assess the performance of our segments, measure the operational cash generating abilities of our segments and develop regional growth strategies such as IBX data center expansion decisions. We define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations plus depreciation expense, amortization expense, accretion expense, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges and acquisition costs. See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below for more information about adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to income or loss from operations. Periodically, we enter into new lease agreements or amend existing lease agreements. To the extent we conclude that a lease is an operating lease, the rent expense may decrease our adjusted EBITDA whereas to the extent we conclude that a lease is a capital or financing lease, and this lease was previously reported as an operating lease, this outcome may increase our adjusted EBITDA. Our adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2015 % 2014 % Actual Constant currencyAmericas$698,604 55% $635,007 57% 10% 12%EMEA318,561 25% 269,222 24% 18% 35%Asia-Pacific254,462 20% 209,662 19% 21% 34%Total$1,271,627 100% $1,113,891 100% 14% 22%Americas Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our Americas adjusted EBITDA was due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by higher adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation and other headcount related expenses to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $12.2 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Americas adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.EMEA Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our EMEA adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above. During the year ended December 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $45.4 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pounds and Euro during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.Asia-Pacific Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by higher adjusted operating expenses as percentages of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation and other headcount related expenses and higher professional fees to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $26.1 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.51Table of ContentsYears Ended December 31, 2014 and 2013Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % change 2014 % 2013 % Actual Constant currencyAmericas: Recurring revenues$1,311,518 54% $1,214,301 56% 8% 10%Non-recurring revenues64,585 3% 50,473 3% 28% 28% 1,376,103 57% 1,264,774 59% 9% 11%EMEA: Recurring revenues598,953 24% 492,361 23% 22% 19%Non-recurring revenues38,312 1% 32,657 1% 17% 19% 637,265 25% 525,018 24% 21% 19%Asia-Pacific: Recurring revenues407,319 17% 343,300 16% 19% 22%Non-recurring revenues23,089 1% 19,674 1% 17% 26% 430,408 18% 362,974 17% 19% 22%Total: Recurring revenues2,317,790 95% 2,049,962 95% 13% 14%Non-recurring revenues125,986 5% 102,804 5% 23% 25% $2,443,776 100% $2,152,766 100% 14% 15%Americas Revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our revenues from the United States, the largest revenue contributor in the Americas region for the periods, represented approximately 91% of the regional revenues. Growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to (i) $38.3 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers and IBX data center expansions in the Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Miami, New York and Sao Paolo metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our utilization rate, as discussed above. During the year ended December 31, 2014, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $22.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Americas revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. We expect that our Americas revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in the recently-opened IBX data centers and additional IBX data center expansions currently taking place in the Dallas, New York, Philadelphia, Rio de Janeiro, Seattle, Silicon Valley, Toronto and Washington, D.C. metro areas, which opened during 2015.EMEA Revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our revenues from the United Kingdom, the largest revenue contributor in the EMEA region for the periods, represented approximately 36% of the regional revenues. Our EMEA revenue growth was due to (i) $20.0 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers and IBX data center expansions in the Amsterdam and Frankfurt metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. During the year ended December 31, 2014, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $11.1 million of favorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA revenues primarily due to the generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss franc during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. We expect that our EMEA revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in recently-opened IBX data centers and an additional IBX data center expansion currently taking place in the Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris metro areas, which opened during 2015.Asia-Pacific Revenues. Our revenues from Singapore, the largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, represented approximately 38% and 36%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. Our Asia-Pacific revenue growth was due to (i) $53.4 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers and IBX data center expansions in the Hong Kong, Melbourne, Osaka, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo metro areas and (ii) an increase in 52Table of Contentsorders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. During the year ended December 31, 2014, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $13.7 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Asia-Pacific revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. We expect that our Asia-Pacific revenues will continue to grow in future periods as a result of continued growth in these recently-opened IBX data center expansions and additional expansions currently taking place in the Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo metro areas, which opened during 2015 or are expected to open during 2016.Cost of Revenues.

Our Americas cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 included $218.4 million and $216.6 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in our Americas cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $17.7 million of higher utilities and repair and maintenance expense in support of our business growth, (ii) $8.7 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (941 employees included in Americas cost of revenues as of December 31, 2014 versus 894 as of December 31, 2013), (iii) $8.1 million of higher costs associated with equipment resales to support the growth of non-recurring revenues and (iv) $3.9 million of higher accretion expenses as a result of the reversal of asset retirement obligations during the year ended December 31, 2013 associated with the execution of certain lease amendments, partially offset by $12.9 million of lower rent and facility costs primarily as a result of either certain leases no longer being subject to operating lease treatment or the purchase of previously-leased sites. During the year ended December 31, 2014, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $16.3 million of favorable foreign currency impact on our Americas cost of revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.EMEA Cost of Revenues. EMEA cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 included $97.8 million and $77.9 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX data center expansion activity. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in our EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $29.9 million of higher utility costs, repair and maintenance, professional fees and rent and facility costs in support of our revenue growth, (ii) $7.4 million of higher compensation, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (473 employees included in EMEA cost of revenues as of December 31, 2014 versus 396 as of December 31, 2013) and (iii) $5.8 million of higher costs associated with equipment resales, bandwidth and other customer services in support of our non-recurring revenues growth. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA cost of revenues primarily due to the generally 53Table of Contentsweaker U.S. dollar relative to the British pound, Euro and Swiss franc during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 included $101.4 million and $82.6 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. Growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX data center expansion activity. Excluding depreciation expense, the increase in Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $13.7 million in higher utility costs, repairs and maintenance costs, as well as rent and facility costs in support of our revenue growth; (ii) $2.7 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (342 employees included in Asia-Pacific cost of revenues as of December 31, 2014 versus 289 as of December 31, 2013) and (iii) $3.3 million of higher costs associated with equipment resales in support of our non-recurring revenues growth.

The increase in our EMEA sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $8.2 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense as a result of business growth, which incorporates a change in our sales commission practices whereby our sales commission accrual will occur when sales orders are booked versus when the sales orders are billed. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our EMEA sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2013.Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $9.5 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, commission, stock-based compensation as a result of business and headcount growth (155 Asia-Pacific sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 54Table of Contents2014 versus 120 as of December 31, 2013), which incorporates a change in our sales commission practices whereby our sales commission accrual will occur when sales orders are booked versus when the sales orders are billed.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2013.Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we did not record any restructuring charges. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a $4.8 million reversal of the restructuring charge accrual for our excess space in the 55Table of ContentsNew York 2 IBX data center as a result of our decision to purchase this property and utilize the space. See “Restructuring Charges” in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Acquisition Costs.

The increase in our Americas income from operations was due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation expense and higher professional fees to support our growth. EMEA Income from Operations. The increase in our EMEA income from operations was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation expense and higher professional fees to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2014, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $3.3 million of net favorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA income from operations primarily due to the generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and Swiss franc during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.Asia-Pacific Income from Operations. The increase in our Asia-Pacific income from operations was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation expense and higher professional fees to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2014, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $3.2 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Asia-Pacific income from operations primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.Interest Income. Interest income was $2.9 million and $3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 0.33% versus 0.32% for the year ended December 31, 2013.Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $270.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $248.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase in interest expense was primarily due to the impact of our $1.25 billion senior notes offering in November 2014 and $29.8 million of higher interest expense from various capital lease and other financing obligations to support our expansion projects, which was offset by the redemption of our 7.00% senior notes in December 2014, the settlement of the 3.00% convertible notes, the partial redemption of the 4.75% convertible notes in June 2014 and more capitalized interest expense. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we capitalized $19.0 million and $10.6 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress.Other Income (Expense). We recorded $0.1 million and $5.3 million, respectively, of other income for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains (losses) during the periods.Loss on Debt Extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a $157.0 million loss on debt extinguishment, of which $51.2 million was attributable to the exchanges of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes and 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, $103.3 million was attributable to the redemption of our $750.0 million 7.00% senior notes and $2.5 million was attributable to the prepayment and termination of our $750.0 million multicurrency credit facility. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a $108.5 million loss on debt extinguishment, of which $93.6 million was attributable 56Table of Contentsto the redemption of our $750 million 8.125% senior notes, $13.2 million was attributable to the extinguishment of the financing liabilities for our London 4 and 5 IBX data centers and $1.7 million was attributable to an amendment of our New York 5 and 6 IBX lease. For additional information, see “Loss on Debt Extinguishment” in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded $345.5 million of income tax expense. The income tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to the statutory tax rate change due to our anticipated REIT conversion, which resulted in a $324.1 million domestic deferred tax assets write-off. In connection with the formal approval of our conversion to a REIT by our Board of Directors in December 2014, we reassessed, in the fourth quarter of 2014, the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our U.S. operations to be included in the REIT structure. The reevaluation resulted in de-recognizing the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our REIT’s U.S. operations, excluding the deferred tax liabilities associated with the depreciation and amortization recapture expected in 2015. The de-recognition of the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our REIT’s U.S. operations occurred because the expected recovery or settlement of the related assets and liabilities will not result in deductible or taxable amounts in any post-REIT conversion periods. The deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with our foreign operations, regardless of whether such foreign operations are part of the REIT conversion, are not subject to the de-recognition assessment. In addition, we generally do not expect our occasional sale of assets to result in a material tax liability. As of December 31, 2014, we had a net deferred tax liability of approximately $52.2 million for our domestic operations, which included approximately $82.5 million of deferred tax liabilities associated with the depreciation and amortization recapture.During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded $16.2 million of income tax expense. The income tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily attributable to our foreign operations, as we incurred losses in our domestic operations during the period. Our effective tax rates were 407.7% and 14.4%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to tax expense attributable to the domestic deferred tax assets write-off as a result of our REIT conversion. Excluding this tax expense, our effective tax rate would have been 25.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014.During the year ended December 31, 2013, we utilized all of our federal net operating losses free of Section 382 limitations in the U.S. for which a deferred tax asset had been previously recognized and all of our windfall tax losses in the U.S. for which a deferred tax asset had not been previously recognized. We recorded excess income tax benefits of $18.6 million and $25.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheet.To better align our EMEA corporate structure and intercompany relationship with the nature of our business activities and regional centralization, we commenced certain reorganization activities during the fourth quarter of 2012 in the EMEA region. The new organizational structure centralized the majority of our EMEA business management activities in the Netherlands effective July 1, 2013. In December 2013, our Dutch subsidiaries that were created to carry-out EMEA’s centralized management activities received favorable rulings from the Dutch Tax Authorities effective July 1, 2013. The rulings acknowledge the reorganization and agree to a lower level of earnings by our Dutch subsidiaries subject to tax in the Netherlands. The rulings also require both the Dutch Tax Authorities and our Dutch subsidiaries to revisit and renew the agreement in five years from the effective date. As a result, we expect our overall effective tax rate will be lower in subsequent periods as the new structure takes full effect.Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a key factor in how we assess the performance of our segments, measure the operational cash generating abilities of our segments and develop regional growth strategies such as IBX data center expansion decisions. We define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations plus depreciation expense, amortization expense, accretion expense, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges and acquisition costs. See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below for more information about adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to income or loss from operations. Periodically, we enter into new lease agreements or amend existing lease agreements. To the extent we conclude that a lease is an operating lease, the rent expense may decrease our adjusted EBITDA whereas to the extent we conclude that a lease is a capital or financing lease, and this lease was previously reported as an operating lease, this outcome may increase our adjusted EBITDA. Our adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):57Table of Contents Years ended December 31, % change 2014 % 2013 % Actual Constant currencyAmericas$635,007 57% $608,718 61% 4% 6%EMEA269,222 24% 216,186 22% 25% 22%Asia-Pacific209,662 19% 175,994 17% 19% 23%Total$1,113,891 100% $1,000,898 100% 11% 12%Americas Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our Americas adjusted EBITDA was due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by higher adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation expense and higher professional fees to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2014, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $8.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Americas adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. EMEA Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our EMEA adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by higher adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation expense and higher professional fees to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2014, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.9 million of net favorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and Swiss franc during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.Asia-Pacific Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by higher adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation expense and higher professional fees to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2014, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $7.0 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe provide all information required in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), but we believe that evaluating our ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, we use non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operations. Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We have presented such non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and ability to perform in subsequent periods. We believe that if we did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze Equinix effectively. Investors should note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by us may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. Investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing non-GAAP financial measures used by us to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. Our primary non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) and adjusted EBITDA, exclude depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of our IBX data centers and do not reflect our current or future cash spending levels to support our business. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of an IBX data center do not recur with respect to such data center, although we may incur initial construction costs in future periods with respect to additional IBX data centers, and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to our initial investment. This is a trend we expect to continue. In addition, depreciation is also based on the 58Table of Contentsestimated useful lives of our IBX data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs incurred to build out our IBX data centers and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. Therefore, we exclude depreciation from our operating results when evaluating our operations. In addition, in presenting AFFO and adjusted EBITDA, we exclude amortization expense related to certain intangible assets, as it represents the amortization of a cost that may not recur and is not meaningful in the evaluation of our current or future operating performance. We exclude accretion expense, both as it relates to asset retirement obligations as well as accrued restructuring charge liabilities, as these expenses represent costs which we believe are not meaningful in evaluating our current operations. We exclude stock-based compensation expense as it represents expense attributed to equity awards that have no current or future cash obligations. As such, we, and many investors and analysts, exclude this stock-based compensation expense when assessing the cash generating performance of our operations. We also exclude restructuring charges. The restructuring charges relate to our decisions to exit leases for excess space adjacent to several of our IBX data centers, which we did not intend to build out, or our decision to reverse such restructuring charges. We also exclude impairment charges related to certain long-lived assets. The impairment charges are related to expense recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets are not recoverable. Finally, we exclude acquisition costs from AFFO and adjusted EBITDA. The acquisition costs relate to costs we incur in connection with business combinations. Management believes items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges and acquisition costs are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs may occur in future periods.Adjusted EBITDAWe define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges and acquisition costs as presented below (in thousands): Years ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013Income from operations$567,342 $509,266 $460,932Depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense528,929 484,129 431,008Stock-based compensation expense133,633 117,990 102,940Restructuring charges— — (4,837)Acquisition costs41,723 2,506 10,855Adjusted EBITDA$1,271,627 $1,113,891 $1,000,898Our adjusted EBITDA results have improved each year and in each region in total dollars due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in “Results of Operations”, as well as the nature of our business model consisting of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature also discussed earlier in “Overview”.Funds from Operations (“FFO”) and AFFOWe use FFO and AFFO, which are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in the REIT industry. FFO is calculated in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). FFO represents net income (loss), excluding gains (losses) from the disposition of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures’ and non-controlling interests’ share of these items. We use AFFO to evaluate our performance on a consolidated basis and as a metric in the determination of employees’ annual bonuses beginning in 2015 and vesting of restricted stock units that were granted in 2015 that have both service and performance conditions. In presenting AFFO, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future operating performance. AFFO represents FFO excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate assets, accretion, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on debt extinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures’ and non-controlling interests’ share of these items. We include an adjustment for revenue from installation fees, since installation fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the expected life of the installation, although the fees are generally paid in a lump sum upon installation. We include an adjustment for straight-line rent expense on its operating leases, since the total minimum lease payments are recognized ratably over the lease term, although the lease payments generally increase over the lease term. The adjustments for both installation revenue and straight-line rent expense are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight-lined or amortized results in the consolidated statement of operations. We exclude the amortization of deferred financing costs as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings that have no current or future cash obligations. We exclude gains (losses) on debt extinguishment since it represents a cost that may not recur and is not a good indicator of our current or future 59Table of Contentsoperating performance. We include an income tax expense adjustment, which represents changes in its income tax reserves and valuation allowances that may not recur or may not relate to the current year’s operations. We also excludes recurring capital expenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of its IBX centers or other assets that are required to support current revenues.Our FFO and AFFO for were as follows (in thousands): Years ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013Net income (loss)$187,774 $(260,726) $96,123Net (income) loss attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests— 1,179 (1,438)Net (income) loss attributable to Equinix187,774 (259,547) 94,685Adjustments: Real estate depreciation and amortization439,969 417,703 377,049Gain/loss on disposition of real estate property1,382 301 825Adjustments for FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures113 112 112Non-controlling interests' share of above adjustments— (5,303) (6,711)NAREIT FFO attributable to common shareholders$629,238 $153,266 $465,960 Years ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013NAREIT FFO attributable to common shareholders$629,238 $153,266 $465,960Adjustments: Installation revenue adjustment35,498 25,720 25,017Straight-line rent expense adjustment7,931 13,048 8,612Amortization of deferred financing costs16,135 19,020 24,429Stock-based compensation expense133,633 117,990 102,940Non-real estate depreciation expense58,165 36,232 28,395Amortization expense27,446 27,756 27,287Accretion expense3,349 2,438 (1,723)Recurring capital expenditures(120,281) (105,366) (93,504)Loss on debt extinguishment289 156,990 108,501Restructuring charge reversal— — (4,837)Acquisition costs41,723 2,506 10,855Income tax expense adjustment (1)(1,270) 315,289 (16,421)Adjustments for AFFO from unconsolidated joint ventures(58) (76) (185)Non-controlling interests' share of above adjustments— (3,134) (5,824)Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO) attributable to common shareholders$831,798 $761,679 $679,502_____________(1)Represents changes in its income tax reserves and valuation allowances that may not relate to the current year’s operations. Our AFFO results have improved due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in “Results of Operations,” as well as due to the nature of our business model which consists of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature as discussed earlier in “Overview.” Constant Currency PresentationOur revenues and certain operating expenses (cost of revenues, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses) from our international operations have represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues and 60Table of Contentscertain operating expenses. As a result, our revenues and certain operating expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. dollar against major international currencies such as the Brazilian reals, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Chinese Yuan, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar. In order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present period-over-period percentage changes in our revenues and certain operating expenses on a constant currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, we have presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results. To present this information, our current and comparative prior period revenues and certain operating expenses from entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2014 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2015 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2015 with the year ended December 31, 2014, and average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2013 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2014 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2014 with the year ended December 31, 2013). Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of December 31, 2015, our total indebtedness was comprised of (i) convertible debt principal totaling $150.1 million from our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes (gross of discount) and (ii) non-convertible debt and financing obligations totaling approximately $6.4 billion consisting of (a) approximately $3.9 billion of principal from our senior notes, (b) approximately $1.3 billion from our capital lease and other financing obligations, (c) $325.6 million from our revolving credit facility, and (c) $920.1 million of principal from our mortgage and other loans payable (gross of discount and premium).We believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of the current portion of our debt as it becomes due, payment of regular dividend and special distributions due to our REIT conversion (see below) and completion of our publicly-announced expansion projects. As of December 31, 2015, we had $2.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, of which approximately $2.0 billion was held in the U.S. In January 2016, we used £1.2 billion, or approximately $1.7 billion in U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect on January 15, 2016, to fund the cash portion of the TelecityGroup purchase price. We believe that our current expansion activities in the U.S. can be funded with our cash and cash equivalents and investments. As of December 31, 2015, we had 30 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $55.3 million issued and outstanding under the revolving credit facility; as a result of these letters of credit plus $325.6 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, we had a total of approximately $1.1 of additional liquidity available to us under the revolving credit facility. Besides any further financing activities we may pursue, customer collections are our primary source of cash. While we believe we have a strong customer base, and have continued to experience relatively strong collections, if the current market conditions were to deteriorate, some of our customers may have difficulty paying us and we may experience increased churn in our customer base, including reductions in their commitments to us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Additionally, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build out of new IBX data centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as potential acquisitions. We are also now operating as a REIT (see below). While we expect to fund these plans with our existing resources, additional financing, either debt or equity, may be required if current market conditions were to deteriorate, we may be unable to secure additional financing or any such additional financing may only be available to us on unfavorable terms. An inability to pursue additional expansion opportunities will have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our desired level of revenue growth in future periods.Impact of REIT ConversionWe completed our conversion to a REIT in 2014 and began operating as a REIT effective January 1, 2015. As a result of our conversion to a REIT, we made special distributions to our stockholders in 2015 and 2014. The distributions were payable in common stock or cash at the election of our stockholders, with the cash portion of the distributions subject to certain maximum amounts. As a result of the special distributions, we paid a total of $125.5 million in 2015 and $83.3 million in 2014 and distributed 1.7 million and 1.5 million shares of common stock in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Also as a result of our conversion to a REIT, we began paying quarterly dividends in 2015. We paid an aggregate of $396.0 million of cash dividends during 2015, which consisted of $393.6 million of cash dividends paid to shareholders and $2.4 million of cash paid in lieu of stock for fractional shares upon the vesting of restricted stock units.61Table of ContentsWe have incurred $78.3 million in costs to support our conversion to a REIT since 2012, including $4.5 million and $49.4 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We expect to incur approximately $10.0 million annually in REIT compliance costs.Sources and Uses of Cash Years ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (dollars in thousands)Net cash provided by operating activities$894,793 $689,420 $604,608Net cash used in investing activities(1,134,927) (435,839) (1,169,313)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities1,873,182 107,401 574,907Operating ActivitiesThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to improved operating results. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to improved operating results, offset by unfavorable working capital activities such as decreased collections of customer receivables and a $51.4 million increase in interest payments. We expect we will continue to generate cash from our operating activities during 2016.Investing ActivitiesThe increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a $513.9 million increase in restricted cash, primarily in connection with our cash and share offer for TelecityGroup, $245.6 million, net of cash for our acquisition of Bit-isle and Nimbo, $207.9 million of higher capital expenditures primarily as a result of expansion activity and $21.5 million of higher purchase of real estate, partially offset by $187.0 million of lower purchase of investments and $87.6 million of higher sales and maturities of investment. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities during 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to $423.0 million of lower purchases of investments, $295.7 million of higher sales and maturities of investments, $57.5 million of lower real estate purchases and $49.3 million of lower business acquisition spending, partially offset by $87.8 million of higher capital expenditures as a result of more IBX expansion activity. In May 2015, we announced a cash and share offer valued at £2.4 billion or $3.8 billion U.S dollars for the entire issued and outstanding share capital of TelecityGroup. The acquisition closed on January 15, 2016.During 2016, we expect that our IBX expansion construction activity will be greater than our 2015 levels. However, if the opportunity to expand is greater than planned and we have sufficient funding to pursue such expansion opportunities, we may further increase the level of capital expenditures to support this growth as well as pursue additional business acquisitions, property acquisitions or joint ventures. Financing ActivitiesNet cash provided by financing activities during 2015 was primarily due to (i) $1.1 billion of gross proceeds from the senior notes offering in December 2015, (ii) $829.5 million of net proceeds from our public offering of common stock in November 2015, (iii) $1.2 billion of proceeds from loans payable including proceeds from our term loan modification, our bridge term loan and our revolving credit facility, partially offset by (iv) $715.3 million repayment of mortgage and loans payable including repayment of $171.2 million of loans assumed in the Bit-isle acquisition and repayment of $544.1 million of U.S. dollar-denominated term loan and other mortgage and loan payments, (v) $396.0 million of quarterly dividend distributions and (vi) $125.5 million of special distributions. The net cash provided by financing activities for 2014 was primarily due to $1.25 billion of proceeds from the senior notes offering in November 2014, $500.0 million of proceeds from the term loan facility, partially offset by (i) $1.1 billion for repayment of debt including $750.0 million for the redemption of the 7.00% senior notes, prepayment of the remaining principal balance of the U.S. term loan of $110.0 million, $43.5 million for repayments of mortgage and other loan payable, and $29.5 million for the exchanges of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes and 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, (ii) $298.0 million for the purchases of treasury stock, (iii) $226.3 million for the purchase of Riverwood’s interest in ALOG and the approximate 10% of ALOG owned by ALOG management and (iv) $83.3 million for the cash portion of the special distribution. The net cash provided by financing activities for 2013 was primarily due to $1.5 billion of proceeds from the senior notes offering in March 2013, partially offset by $834.7 million for the redemption of the $750.0 million 8.125% senior notes, repayments of various debt 62Table of Contentsand purchases of treasury stock. Going forward, we expect that our financing activities will consist primarily of repayment of our debt and additional financings needed to support expansion opportunities, additional acquisitions or joint ventures and the payment of our regular cash dividends.Debt ObligationsDebt FacilitiesWe have various debt obligations with maturity dates ranging from 2016 to 2026 under which a total principal balance of $5.2 billion remained outstanding as of December 31, 2015. For further information on debt obligations, see “Debt Facilities” in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Capital Lease and Other Financing ObligationsWe have numerous capital lease and other financing obligations with maturity dates ranging from 2016 to 2065 under which a total principal balance of $1.3 billion remained outstanding as of December 31, 2015 with a weighted average effective interest rate of 8.17%. For further information on our capital leases and other financing obligations, see “Capital Leases and Other Financing Obligations” in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet ArrangementsWe lease a majority of our IBX data centers and certain equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements expiring through 2065.

These letters of credit were provided in lieu of cash deposits under the revolving credit facility. If the landlords for these IBX leases decide to draw down on these letters of credit triggered by an event of default under the lease, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowing under the revolving credit facility. These contingent commitments are not reflected in the table above.We had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaling approximately $26.8 million as of December 31, 2015. These liabilities, which are reflected on our balance sheet, are not reflected in the table above since it is unclear when these liabilities will be paid.Primarily as a result of our various IBX data center expansion projects, as of December 31, 2015, we were contractually committed for $256.8 million of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for IBX equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided in connection with the work necessary to complete construction and open these IBX data centers prior to making them available to customers for installation. This amount, which is expected to be paid during 2016 and thereafter, is reflected in the table above as “other contractual commitments.”We had other non-capital purchase commitments in place as of December 31, 2015, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods or services to be delivered or provided during 2016 and beyond. Such other purchase commitments as of December 31, 2015, which total $352.2 million, are also reflected in the table above as “other contractual commitments.”In addition, although we are not contractually obligated to do so, we expect to incur additional capital expenditures of approximately $359.6 million to $459.6 million, in addition to the $609.0 million in contractual commitments discussed above as of December 31, 2015, in our various IBX data center expansion projects during 2016 and thereafter in order to complete the work needed to open these IBX data centers. These non-contractual capital expenditures are not reflected in the table above. If we so choose, whether due to economic factors or other considerations, we could delay these non-contractual capital expenditure commitments to preserve liquidity.Other Off-Balance-Sheet ArrangementsWe have various guarantor arrangements with both our directors and officers and third parties, including customers, vendors and business partners. As of December 31, 2015, there were no significant liabilities recorded for these arrangements. For additional information, see “Guarantor Arrangements” in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require significant judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain:•Accounting for income taxes;•Accounting for business combinations;•Accounting for impairment of goodwill; and•Accounting for property, plant and equipment.64Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ From AssumptionsAccounting for Income Taxes.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or settled. The accounting standard for income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined by the accounting standard as a likelihood of more than 50%) that such assets will not be realized.A tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authority’s widely understood administrative practices and precedents.The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future events. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. If, based on the weight of that available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified.This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account a number of types of evidence, including the following: 1) the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, 2) sources of future taxable income and 3) tax planning strategies.In assessing the tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position, the tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded a total of net deferred tax liabilities of $39.5 million and $100.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had a total valuation allowance of $29.9 million and $27.2 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we decided to provide a partial release of valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets associated with certain foreign operating entities, which resulted in an insignificant income tax benefit in our results of operations. Our decisions to release our valuation allowances were based on our belief that the operations of these jurisdictions had achieved a sufficient level of profitability and will sustain a sufficient level of profitability in the future to support the release of these valuation allowances based on relevant facts and circumstances. However, if our assumptions on the future performance of these jurisdictions prove not to be correct and these jurisdictions are not able to sustain a sufficient level of profitability to support the associated deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet, we will have to impair our deferred tax assets through an additional valuation allowance, which would impact our financial position and results of operations in the period such a determination is made.Our remaining valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015 was $29.9 million and primarily relates to certain of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. If and when we release our remaining valuation allowances, it will have a favorable impact to our financial position and results of operations in the periods such determinations are made. We will continue to assess the need for our valuation allowances, by country or location, in the future.As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $30.8 million and $36.1 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $5.3 million primarily due to an agreement with Dutch Tax Authorities on the availability of historical loss carry-forwards to offset future profits generated by the Dutch fiscal unity. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the unrecognized tax benefits decreased by an insignificant amount primarily due to the settlement of a tax audit and the lapse of statute of limitations in our foreign operations. The unrecognized tax benefits of $30.8 million as of December 31, 2015, if subsequently recognized, will affect our effective tax rate favorably at the time when such benefits are recognized. 65Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ From AssumptionsAccounting for Business CombinationsIn accordance with the accounting standard for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as customer contracts, leases and any other significant assets or liabilities and contingent consideration. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date if we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires assumptions and management’s judgment to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. During the last three years, we have completed three business combinations, including the Bit-isle acquisition in November 2015, the Nimbo acquisition in January 2015 and the Frankfurt Kleyer 90 Carrier Hotel acquisition in October 2013. The purchase price allocation for the Bit-isle and Frankfurt Kleyer 90 Carrier Hotel acquisitions were completed in the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2013, respectively. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we used to complete the purchase price allocations and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, which would be recorded in our statements of operations in 2016 or beyond. Accounting for Impairment of GoodwillIn accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform goodwill impairment reviews annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from November 30th to October 31st of each year, commencing on October 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we elected to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value.During the year ended December 31, 2015, we completed annual goodwill impairment assessment of the Americas reporting unit, the EMEA reporting unit and the Asia-Pacific reporting unit and concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units exceeded their carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test.During the year ended December 31, 2015, we elected to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value requires assumptions and estimates before performing the two-step goodwill impairment test, the assessment requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data.Prior to 2015, when we elected to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test, we used both the income and market approach. Under the income approach, we develop a five-year cash flow forecast and use our weighted-average cost of capital applicable to our reporting units as discount rates. This requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. The market approach requires judgment in determining the appropriate market comparables.These assumptions require significant management judgment and are inherently subject to uncertainties. As of December 31, 2015, goodwill attributable to the Americas reporting unit, the EMEA reporting unit and the Asia-Pacific reporting unit was $460.2 million, $374.1 million and $228.9 million, respectively. Future events, changing market conditions and any changes in key assumptions may result in an impairment charge. While we have not recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill to date, the development of adverse business conditions in our Americas, EMEA or Asia-Pacific reporting units, such as higher than anticipated customer churn or significantly increased operating costs, or significant deterioration of our market comparables that we use in the market approach, could result in an impairment charge in future periods. Any potential impairment charge against our goodwill would not exceed the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.66Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ From AssumptionsAccounting for Property, Plant and EquipmentWe have a substantial amount of property, plant and equipment recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The vast majority of our property, plant and equipment represent the costs incurred to build out or acquire our IBX data centers. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets. The majority of our IBX data centers are in properties that are leased. We depreciate our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (subject to the term of the lease in the case of leased assets or leasehold improvements and integral equipment located in leased properties). Accounting for property, plant and equipment includes determining the appropriate period in which to depreciate such assets, making assessments for leased properties to determine whether they are capital or operating leases, determining if construction projects performed at leased properties trigger build-to-suit lease accounting, assessing such assets for potential impairment, capitalizing interest during periods of construction and assessing the asset retirement obligations required for certain leased properties that require us to return the leased properties back to their original condition at the time we decide to exit a leased property.While there are numerous judgments and uncertainties involved in accounting for property, plant and equipment that are significant, arriving at the estimated useful life of an asset requires the most critical judgment for us and changes to these estimates would have the most significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. When we lease a property for our IBX data centers, we generally enter into long-term arrangements with initial lease terms of at least 8-10 years and with renewal options generally available to us. During the next several years, a number of leases for our IBX data centers will come up for renewal. As we start approaching the end of these initial lease terms, we will need to reassess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment. In addition, we may find that our estimates for the useful lives of non-leased assets may also need to be revised periodically. We periodically review the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment and changes in these estimates in the future are possible. Another area of judgment for us in connection with our property, plant and equipment is related to lease accounting. Most of our IBX data centers are leased. Each time we enter into a new lease or lease amendment for one of our IBX data centers, we analyze each lease or lease amendment for the proper accounting. This requires certain judgments on our part such as establishing the lease term to include in a lease test, establishing the remaining estimated useful life of the underlying property or equipment and estimating the fair value of the underlying property or equipment and establishing the incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payment for the lease test. All of these judgments are inherently uncertain. Different assumptions or estimates could result in a different accounting treatment for a lease.The assessment of long-lived assets for impairment requires assumptions and estimates of undiscounted and discounted future cash flows. These assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and are inherently uncertain.We did not revise the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2013. During the quarter ended December 31, 2014, we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment. As a result, we recorded an insignificant amount of higher depreciation expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 due to the reduction of the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment. We undertook this review due to our determination that we were generally using certain of our existing assets over a shorter period than originally anticipated and, therefore, the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment has been shortened. This change was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis effective October 1, 2014 under the accounting standard for change in accounting estimates. As of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we had property, plant and equipment of $5.6 billion, $5.0 billion, and $4.6 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded depreciation expense of $498.1 million, $453.9 million, and $405.5 million, respectively. Further changes in our estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment could have a significant impact on our results of operations.As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had property, plant and equipment under capital leases and other financing obligations of $1.5 billion, $1.1 billion and $949.0 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded depreciation expense of $52.9 million, $43.2 million, and $32.5 million respectively, related to property, plant and equipment under capital leases and other financing obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, we recorded interest expense of $104.4 million, $86.4 million, $56.6 million, respectively related to property, plant, equipment, under capital leases and other financing obligations. Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded rent expense of $200.0 million $105.4 million, and $112.7 million under operating leases. Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.67Table of ContentsITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket Risk The following discussion about market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity.We employ foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging certain specifically-identified exposures. The use of these financial instruments is intended to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, but does not eliminate such risks. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Investment Portfolio RiskWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities that is prioritized on meeting REIT asset requirements. All of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale and, therefore, are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax. We consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge for our securities, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. We anticipate that we will recover the entire cost basis of these securities and have determined that no other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were required to be recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015.As of December 31, 2015, our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market fund investments, U.S. government securities, certificates of deposits and publicly traded equity securities and publicly traded fixed income securities. The amount in our investment portfolio that could be susceptible to market risk totaled $1.1 billion.Interest Rate Risk Our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk which meets asset measurement requirements for REIT qualification. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates or credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Securities with longer maturities are subject to a greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities. As of December 31, 2015, the average duration of our portfolio was less than one year. An immediate hypothetical shift in the yield curves of plus or minus 50 basis points from their position as of December 31, 2015 would not have a material impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift of all interest rates, however, interest rates do not always move in such a manner and actual results may differ materially. We monitor our interest rate and credit risk, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers. There were no impairment charges on our cash equivalents and fixed income securities during the year ended December 31, 2015.An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates from their position as of December 31, 2015 would not have a material impact on our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of the majority of our debt obligations. However, the interest expense associated with our senior credit facility, the Brazil financings and bridge term loan, which bear interest at variable rates, could be affected. For every 100 basis point change in interest rates, our annual interest expense could increase or decrease by a total of approximately $6.9 million based on the total balance of our primary borrowings under the term loan A facility, revolving credit facility, bridge term loan and the Brazil financings as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we had not employed any interest rate derivative products against our debt obligations. However, we may enter into interest rate hedging agreements in the future to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk.The fair value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate changes may affect the fair value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair value of our convertible debt, which is traded in the market, is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of our loans payable, which are not traded in the market, is estimated by considering our credit rating, current rates available to us for debt of the same remaining maturities and the terms of the debt. The following table represents the carrying value and estimated fair value of our loans payable, senior notes and convertible debt as of (in thousands):68Table of Contents December 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 Carrying Value (1) Fair Value Carrying Value (1) Fair ValueMortgage and loans payable$920,064 $916,602 $595,752 $553,045Convertible debt150,082 151,997 157,885 162,159Senior notes3,850,000 3,954,000 2,750,000 2,790,023Revolving credit facility325,622 325,617 — —___________________(1)The carrying value is gross of debt discount.Foreign Currency Risk A significant portion of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, however, approximately 48.5% of our revenues and 48.6% of our operating costs are attributable to Brazil, Canada and the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions and a large portion of those revenues and costs are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Brazilian Reals, Canadian dollar, British pound, Euro, Swiss franc, United Arab Emirates dirham, Australian dollar, Chinese Yuan, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar. As a result, our operating results and cash flows are impacted by currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar. To protect against certain reductions in value caused by changes in currency exchange rates, we have established a risk management program to offset some of the risk of carrying assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. We entered into foreign currency forward contracts to help manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for forecasted revenues and expenses in our EMEA region. Our risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements and its impact on the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of less than two years.For the foreseeable future, we anticipate that more than 50% of our revenues and operating costs will continue to be generated and incurred outside of the U.S. in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. During fiscal 2015, the U.S. dollar was generally strong relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate. This overall strength of the U.S. dollar had a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations because the foreign denominations translated into less U.S. dollars. In future periods, the volatility of the U.S. dollar as compared to the other currencies in which we do business could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations including the amount of revenue that we report in future periods.Excluding consideration from hedging contracts, an immediate 10% appreciation in current foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2015 would have resulted in an increase of $130.8 million and $23.1 million in revenue and net income before taxes. Excluding consideration from hedging contracts, an immediate 10% depreciation in current foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2015 would have resulted in a decrease of $128.4 million and $25.2 million in revenue and net income before taxes.We may enter into additional hedging activities in the future to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency risk as our exposure to foreign currency risk continues to increase due to our growing foreign operations; however, we do not currently intend to eliminate all foreign currency transaction exposure. Commodity Price RiskCertain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of price changes are electricity, supplies and equipment used in our IBX data centers. We closely monitor the cost of electricity at all of our locations. We have entered into several power contracts to purchase power at fixed prices during 2014 and beyond in certain locations in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom.In addition, as we are building new, or expanding existing, IBX data centers, we are subject to commodity price risk for building materials related to the construction of these IBX data centers, such as steel and copper. In addition, the lead-time to procure certain pieces of equipment, such as generators, is substantial. Any delays in procuring the necessary pieces of equipment for the construction of our IBX data centers could delay the anticipated openings of these new IBX data centers and, as a result, increase the cost of these projects.69Table of ContentsWe do not currently employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to address commodity price risk other than the power contracts discussed above.",2023-12-30 20:28:32.257427
1101239,EQIX,EQUINIX INC,2017,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information in this discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements are based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. For example, the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist readers in understanding our financial information from our management’s perspective and is presented as follows:•Overview•Results of Operations•Non-GAAP Financial Measures•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements•Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates•Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn December 2016, as more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we entered into a transaction agreement with Verizon Communications Inc. (""Verizon"") to acquire Verizon's colocation services business at 24 data center sites, consisting of 29 data center buildings, located in the United States, Brazil and Colombia, for a cash purchase price of $3.6 billion (the ""Verizon Asset Purchase""). The acquisition is expected to close by mid-2017. We expect to fund the acquisition with a combination of cash on hand and proceeds of debt and equity financings. In connection with the Verizon Asset Purchase, we entered into a commitment letter, dated December 6, 2016, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (the ""Commitment Parties""), pursuant to which the Commitment Parties have committed to provide a senior unsecured bridge facility in aggregate principal amount of up to $2.0 billion for the purposes of funding (i) a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition and (ii) the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition. The full amount must be drawn in a single drawing. The initial maturity date is 12 months from the date of the drawdown and, at the initial maturity date (if not repaid prior to that time), the facility will convert into a seven-year senior unsecured term loan. As of December 31, 2016, we had not drawn against the bridge facility. In December 2016, as more fully described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we entered into a third amendment (the ""Third Amendment"") to the credit agreement we entered into on December 17, 2014 with a group of lenders for a $1.5 billion credit facility (the ""Senior Credit Facility""). Pursuant to the Third Amendment, (i) we could borrow up to €1.0 billion in additional term B loan drawings (the ""Term B-2 Loan""), (ii) the interest rate margin applicable to the existing Term Loan B (the ""Term Loan B-1 Facility"") in US Dollars was reduced from 3.25% to 2.50% and the LIBOR floor applicable to such loan was reduced from 0.75% to zero and (iii) the interest rate margin applicable to the loans borrowed under the Term Loan B-1 Facility in Pounds Sterling was reduced from 3.75% to 3.00%, with no change to the existing LIBOR floor of 0.75% applicable to such loan. In January 2017, we borrowed the full amount of the €1.0 billion Term B-2 Loan. The Term B-2 Loan bears interest at an index rate based on EURIBOR plus a margin of 3.25%. No original issue discount is applicable to the Term B-2 Loan. The Term B-2 Loan must be repaid in equal quarterly installments of 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Term B-2 Loan, starting in the second quarter of 2017, with the remaining amount outstanding to be repaid in full on the seventh anniversary of the funding date of the Term B-2 Loan. In June 2016, as more fully described in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we approved the divestiture of the solar power assets of Bit-isle. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we evaluated the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets held for sale associated with Terra Power Co., Ltd., and recorded an impairment charge on other current assets of $7.7 million, reducing the carrying value of such assets from $79.5 million to the estimated fair value of $71.8 million. In October 2016, we entered into a Share Transfer Agreement for the transfer of common stock of Terra Power Co., Ltd., relating to the divestiture of the solar power assets of Bit-isle. We received ¥400.0 million, or 41Table of Contentsapproximately $3.8 million at the exchange rate in effect on October 31, 2016, and by November 30, 2016, we had received an additional ¥2.5 billion, or approximately $22.1 million at the exchange rate in effect at the time of cash receipt. In addition, we expect to receive the remaining payment of ¥5.3 billion in the first quarter of 2017, or approximately $45.5 million at the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2016. The associated loss on the sale was insignificant. In September 2016, as more fully described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we entered into a five year term loan agreement (the ""Japanese Yen Term Loan"") with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, LTd. (""BTMU"") for ¥47.5 billion or approximately $468.4 million in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect as of September 30, 2016. In September 2015, in connection with our acquisition of Bit-isle, we entered into a term loan agreement (the ""Bridge Term Loan Agreement"") with BTMU. BTMU was committed to provide a senior bridge loan facility (the ""Bridge Term Loan"") in the amount of up to ¥47.5 billion or approximately $468.4 million in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect as of September 30, 2016. In October 2016, we borrowed the full amount of the ¥47.5 billion under the Japanese Yen Term Loan and repaid the Bridge Term Loan for a principal amount of ¥47.5 billion or approximately $453.2 million at the exchange rate in effect on October 31, 2016.In April and June 2016, as more fully described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, holders of our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes converted or redeemed a total of $150.1 million of the principal amount of the notes for 2.0 million shares of our common stock and $3.6 million in cash, comprised of accrued interest, cash paid in lieu of fractional shares and principal redemption. Upon maturity of our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes on June 15, 2016, we settled the related capped call transaction and received 380,779 shares of common stock, which was placed in treasury and resulted in a credit of $141.7 million to additional paid in capital based on the market price of $372.10 on June 15, 2016.In January 2016, as more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed our acquisition of Telecity Group plc (""TelecityGroup"") for a total purchase price of approximately $1.6 billion in cash and 6.9 million shares of our common stock valued at approximately $2.1 billion, for a total of $3.7 billion. In January 2016, we terminated our bridge credit agreement for £875.0 million, or approximately $1.3 billion, related to the TelecityGroup acquisition.In January 2016, as more fully described in Notes 4 and 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we agreed to divest eight data centers and related assets, including our London 2 data center (""LD2"") in London, United Kingdom and seven data centers of TelecityGroup in order to obtain the approval of the European Commission for the acquisition of TelecityGroup. The results of operations for the seven TelecityGroup data centers were classified as net income from discontinued operations, net of tax, from January 15, 2016, the date of the acquisition, through July 5, 2016 in our consolidated statement of operations. In July 2016, we completed the sale of these data centers and related assets to Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (""Digital Realty"") for approximately $827.3 million at the exchange rate in effect on July 5, 2016. On August 1, 2016, we purchased Digital Realty’s operating business, including its real estate and facility, in St. Denis, Paris, where we already had an established presence with two IBX data centers, for total cash consideration of approximately €193.8 million or approximately $216.4 million at the exchange rate in effect on August 1, 2016 (the ""Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition"").In January 2016, as more fully described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we borrowed the full amount of the $250.0 million and £300.0 million, or approximately $438.2 million at the exchange rate in effect on January 8, 2016 (""Term Loan B""), made available to us under the second amendment to our Senior Credit Facility to fund the TelecityGroup acquisition.Overview Equinix provides global data center offerings that protect and connect the world’s most valued information assets. Global enterprises, financial services companies and content and network service providers rely upon Equinix’s leading insight and data centers in 41 markets around the world for the safekeeping of their critical IT equipment and the ability to directly connect to the networks that enable today’s information-driven economy. Equinix offers the following solutions: (i) premium data center colocation, (ii) interconnection and (iii) exchange and outsourced IT infrastructure services. As of December 31, 2016, we operated or had partner IBX data centers in the Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Seattle, Silicon Valley, Toronto and Washington, D.C. metro areas in the Americas region; Bulgaria, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) region; and Australia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan and Singapore in the Asia-Pacific region.42Table of Contents Our data centers in 41 markets around the world are a global platform, which allows our customers to increase information and application delivery performance while significantly reducing costs. This global platform and the quality of our IBX data centers have enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. As more customers choose our IBX data centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate with us as well, in order to gain the full economic and performance benefits of our offerings. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a “marketplace” for their services. Our global platform enables scalable, reliable and cost-effective colocation, interconnection and traffic exchange that lowers overall cost and increases flexibility. Our focused business model is built on our critical mass of customers and the resulting “marketplace” effect. This global platform, combined with our strong financial position, continues to drive new customer growth and bookings.Historically, our market has been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled telecommunications products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include cloud computing/utility providers, application hosting providers and systems integrators, managed infrastructure hosting providers and colocation providers. More than 350 companies provide data center solutions in the U.S. alone. Each of these data center solutions providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings, and outsourced IT infrastructure services. We are able to offer our customers a global platform that reaches 21 countries with proven operational reliability, improved application performance and network choice, and a highly scalable set of offerings.Our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus net sellable cabinet space available, taking into account power limitations. Our utilization rate was approximately 81% as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. However, excluding the impact of IBX data center expansion projects that have opened during the last 12 months, our utilization rate would be approximately 84% as of December 31, 2016. Our utilization rate varies from market to market among our IBX data centers across the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain high power-demand customers. This increased power consumption has driven us to build out our new IBX data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX data centers. We could face power limitations in our IBX data centers, even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific IBX data center. This could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given IBX data center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows. Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and offerings. As was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors, such as demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to break even on a free cash flow basis, and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. Depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to Equinix standards. Property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant.Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related interconnection and managed infrastructure offerings. We consider these offerings recurring because our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. In addition, during any given quarter of the past three years, more than half of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 3% of our recurring revenues for the periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and 2% of our recurring revenues for the period ended December 31, 2014. Our 50 largest customers accounted for approximately 36%, 34% and 36%, respectively, of our recurring revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer’s initial deployment and professional services that we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring because they are billed typically once, upon completion of the installation or the professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. However, revenues from installation services are deferred and recognized ratably over the expected life of the customer installation. Additionally, revenue from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is recognized when no remaining performance 43Table of Contentsobligations exist and collectability is reasonably assured, to the extent that the revenue has not previously been recognized. As a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future. Our Americas revenues are derived primarily from colocation and related interconnection offerings, and our EMEA and Asia-Pacific revenues are derived primarily from colocation and managed infrastructure offerings. The largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX data centers, utility costs, including electricity and bandwidth, IBX data center employees’ salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment and security services. A majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing IBX data centers or open or acquire new IBX data centers. However, there are certain costs that are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. We expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will generally increase in the future on a per-unit or fixed basis, in addition to the variable increase related to the growth in consumption by our customers. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months, as compared to other times of the year. To the extent we incur increased utility costs, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, to the extent we incur increased electricity costs as a result of either climate change policies or the physical effects of climate change, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer contract intangible assets.General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees, and other general corporate expenses, such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and some depreciation expense.We expect our cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses to grow in absolute dollars in connection with our business growth. We may periodically see a higher cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue, when a large expansion project opens or is acquired, and before it starts generating any meaningful revenue. Furthermore, in relation to cost of revenues, we note that the Americas region has a lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue than either EMEA or Asia-Pacific. This is due to both the increased scale and maturity of the Americas region, compared to either the EMEA or Asia-Pacific region, as well as a higher cost structure outside of the Americas, particularly in EMEA. While we expect all three regions to continue to see lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in future periods, we expect the trend that sees the Americas having the lowest cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to continue. As a result, to the extent that revenue growth outside the Americas grows in greater proportion than revenue growth in the Americas, our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may increase in future periods. Sales and marketing expenses may periodically increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to scale our operations by investing in sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue, including the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovations. General and administrative expenses may also periodically increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth.Taxation as a REIT We elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 taxable year. As of December 31, 2016, our REIT structure includes all of our data center operations in the U.S., Canada, Japan, our historical data center operations in Europe and a significant portion of the data center operations acquired in the TelecityGroup acquisition. Our data center operations in other jurisdictions are operated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). We plan to complete the REIT integration of the majority of the remaining TelecityGroup business during the first half of 2017.As a REIT, we generally are permitted to deduct from our federal taxable income the dividends we pay to our stockholders (including, for this purpose, the value of any deemed distributions attributable to anti-dilution adjustments made with respect to our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes prior to their maturity in 2016). The income represented by such dividends payment is not subject to federal income tax at the entity level but is taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. Nevertheless, the income of our TRSs which hold our U.S. operations that may not be REIT compliant is subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income tax. Likewise, our foreign subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through TRSs or through qualified REIT subsidiaries (“QRSs”). We are also subject to a separate corporate income tax on gain recognized from a sale of a REIT asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a C corporation (such as (i) an asset that we held as of the effective date of our REIT election, that is, January 1, 2015, or (ii) an asset that we or a QRS hold following the liquidation 44Table of Contentsor other conversion of a former TRS). This built-in-gains tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a REIT asset (e.g., January 1, 2015 in the case of REIT assets we held at the time of our REIT conversion), to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a REIT asset. If we fail to remain qualified for federal income tax as a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate tax rates. Even if we remain qualified for federal income tax as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our TRSs’ operations. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the federal income tax regime for REITs, many states do not completely follow federal rules and some may not follow them at all.On March 23, June 15, September 14, and December 14 of 2016, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $1.75 per share. We expect these quarterly and other applicable distributions to equal or exceed the taxable income that we recognized in 2016.We continue to monitor our REIT compliance in order to maintain our qualification for federal income tax as a REIT. For this and other reasons, as necessary we may convert certain of our data center operations in additional countries into the REIT structure in future periods.Results of OperationsOur results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 include the results of operations of TelecityGroup from January 15, 2016, and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition from August 1, 2016. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 include the results of operations of the Nimbo and Bit-isle acquisitions from January 15, 2015 and November 2, 2015, respectively. Discontinued OperationsWe present the results of operations associated with the TelecityGroup data centers that were divested in July 2016 as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. We did not have any discontinued operations activity during 2015 or 2014.Years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2016 % 2015 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas: Recurring revenues$1,593,084 44% $1,432,084 52% 11% 12%Non-recurring revenues86,465 3% 80,451 3% 7% 8% 1,679,549 47% 1,512,535 55% 11% 11%EMEA: Recurring revenues1,106,652 31% 651,778 24% 70% 75%Non-recurring revenues64,687 1% 47,029 2% 38% 42% 1,171,339 32% 698,807 26% 68% 72%Asia-Pacific: Recurring revenues717,638 20% 485,279 18% 48% 46%Non-recurring revenues43,463 1% 29,246 1% 49% 46% 761,101 21% 514,525 19% 48% 46%Total: Recurring revenues3,417,374 95% 2,569,141 94% 33% 34%Non-recurring revenues194,615 5% 156,726 6% 24% 25% $3,611,989 100% $2,725,867 100% 33% 34%45Table of ContentsAmericas Revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our revenues from the United States, the largest revenue contributor in the Americas region for the periods, represented approximately 92% and 93%, respectively, of the regional revenues. Growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to (i) $28.9 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real than during the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in approximately $6.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Americas revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2015. EMEA Revenues. Revenues for our EMEA region for the year ended December 31, 2016 include $404.1 million of revenues attributable to TelecityGroup, which closed in January 2016, and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, which closed in August 2016. After our acquisition of TelecityGroup, the U.K. continues to be our largest revenue contributor in the EMEA region, providing 32% of regional revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 37% of regional revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our EMEA revenue growth was primarily due to (i) $404.1 million of revenues attributable to TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, (ii) approximately $49.7 million of revenue from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Paris and Zurich metro areas and (iii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $33.5 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA revenues primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Asia-Pacific Revenues. Revenues for our Asia-Pacific region for the year ended December 31, 2016 include $148.7 million of revenues attributable to Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015. After our acquisition of Bit-isle, Japan is our largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, providing 35% of regional revenues including Bit-isle for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 20% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding revenues attributable to Bit-isle, our revenues from Singapore, which was our largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region before we acquired Bit-isle, represented approximately 38% and 39%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Our Asia-Pacific revenue growth was primarily due to (i) $148.7 million of revenues attributable to Bit-isle, (ii) approximately $58.2 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data center expansions in the Hong Kong, Melbourne, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo metro areas and (iii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Japanese Yen than during the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in approximately $7.5 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2015. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2016 % 2015 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$700,544 38% $637,604 49% 10% 11%EMEA653,766 36% 350,270 27% 87% 91%Asia-Pacific466,560 26% 303,632 24% 54% 52%Total$1,820,870 100% $1,291,506 100% 41% 42% Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues: Americas 42% 42%EMEA 56% 50%Asia-Pacific 61% 59%Total 50% 47%46Table of ContentsAmericas Cost of Revenues. Our Americas cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 included $241.6 million and $219.1 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. The growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX expansion activity. In addition to the increase in depreciation expense, the increase in our Americas cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to (i) $22.9 million of higher utilities, rent and facilities costs, office expense, consulting, and repairs and maintenance in support of our business growth, (ii) $10.1 million of higher costs primarily due to custom service orders in support of our revenue growth and (iii) $4.5 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.9 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our Americas cost of revenues primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. We expect Americas cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business.EMEA Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues for our EMEA region for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $273.5 million of cost of revenues attributable to TelecityGroup, which closed in January 2016, and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, which closed in August 2016. Excluding cost of revenues attributable to TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, EMEA cost of revenues was $380.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $350.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Depreciation expense, excluding TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, was $100.8 million and $97.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX data center expansion activity. Excluding the impact of TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, the remaining increase in our EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $16.4 million of higher utilities, consulting, and repairs and maintenance costs in support of our business growth, (ii) $4.7 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (623 EMEA cost of revenues employees, excluding TelecityGroup employees, as of December 31, 2016 versus 541 as of December 31, 2015), (iii) $8.3 million of other costs primarily related to the impact from cash flow hedges, offset by $4.0 million of lower rent and facilities costs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $13.6 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA cost of revenues, primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. We expect EMEA cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business and as a result of our acquisitions of TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX data centers.Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues for our Asia-Pacific region included $116.0 million and $17.4 million of cost of revenues attributable to Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding cost of revenues attributable to Bit-isle, Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was $350.6 million for Asia-Pacific for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $286.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Depreciation expense, excluding Bit-isle, was $149.5 million and $116.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX data center expansion activity. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of Bit-isle, the remaining increase in our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $26.0 million of higher utilities, rent, facility costs, consulting, custom service orders, repairs and maintenance costs in support of our business growth and (ii) $4.5 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (431 Asia-Pacific cost of revenues employees as of December 31, 2016 versus 390 as of December 31, 2015, excluding Bit-isle employees in both periods). During the year ended December 31, 2016, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Japanese Yen than during the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in approximately $5.6 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2015. We expect Asia-Pacific cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business, including from the impact of our acquisition of Bit-isle.47Table of ContentsSales and Marketing Expenses.

The increase in our Americas sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to (i) $16.4 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (553 Americas sales and marketing employees as December 31, 2016 versus 497 as of December 31, 2015) and (ii) $7.9 million of higher advertising, promotion, consulting and travel expenses to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Americas sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2015. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our Americas sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts. We anticipate that we will continue to invest in Americas sales and marketing initiatives. As such, we expect our Americas sales and marketing expenses to continue to grow over the next year.EMEA Sales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses for our EMEA region for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $53.0 million attributable to TelecityGroup, which closed in January 2016. Excluding the impact of TelecityGroup, our EMEA sales and marketing expenses were $84.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $71.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to (i) $6.5 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (283 EMEA sales and marketing employees, excluding TelecityGroup employees, as of December 31, 2016 versus 227 as of December 31, 2015), and (ii) $4.0 million of higher advertising, promotion, consulting, and other marketing expenses to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.8 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA sales and marketing expenses primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our EMEA sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts. We expect our EMEA sales and marketing expenses to increase as a result of the TelecityGroup acquisition.Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses for our Asia-Pacific region included $15.6 million and $2.2 million of sales and marketing expenses attributable to Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding the impact of Bit-isle, our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses were $54.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to $4.9 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (205 Asia-Pacific sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2016 versus 183 as of December 31, 2015, excluding Bit-isle employees in both periods). For the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2015. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts. We expect our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses to increase as a result of the Bit-isle acquisition. 48Table of ContentsGeneral and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2016 % 2015 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$391,637 56% $347,421 70% 13% 13%EMEA228,310 33% 92,803 19% 146% 157%Asia-Pacific74,614 11% 53,060 11% 41% 40%Total$694,561 100% $493,284 100% 41% 43% Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015General and Administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues: Americas23% 23%EMEA19% 13%Asia-Pacific10% 10%Total19% 18%Americas General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $17.5 million of higher depreciation expense associated with certain systems to improve our quote to order and billing processes and other systems to support the integration and growth of our business, (ii) $16.0 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and headcount growth (934 Americas general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2016 versus 800 as of December 31, 2015) and (iii) $10.7 million of higher office expense, rent and facility cost and outside services consulting costs also in line with our overall growth. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Americas general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2015. Over the last several years, we have been investing in our Americas general and administrative functions to scale this region effectively for growth, which has included additional investments into improving our back office systems. We expect our current efforts to improve our back office systems will continue over the next several years. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect Americas general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to further scale our operations to support our growth, including these investments in our back office systems and maintaining our REIT qualification.EMEA General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for our EMEA region for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $92.7 million attributable to TelecityGroup, which closed in January 2016, and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, which closed in August 2016. Excluding the impact of TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, our EMEA general and administrative expenses were $135.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $92.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the impact of TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, the increase was primarily due to (i) $22.8 million of higher consulting services, travel, office and rent and facility costs to support the integration of TelecityGroup and (ii) $18.0 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (562 EMEA general and administrative employees, excluding TelecityGroup employees, as of December 31, 2016 versus 420 as of December 31, 2015). During the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $10.1 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA general and administrative expenses primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in EMEA general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to an increase in amortization expense of $43.9 million associated with the TelecityGroup acquired intangibles. Over the last several years, we have been investing in our EMEA general and administrative functions as a result of our ongoing efforts to scale this region effectively for growth. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending given the current economic environment, we expect our EMEA general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth, as well as ongoing integration of TelecityGroup.Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for our Asia-Pacific region included $17.4 million and $5.8 million of general and administrative expenses attributable to Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding the impact of Bit-isle, our Asia-Pacific general and 49Table of Contentsadministrative expenses were $57.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the impact of Bit-isle, the increase was primarily due to $8.5 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (317 Asia-Pacific general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2016 versus 266 as of December 31, 2015, excluding Bit-isle employees in both periods). For the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2015. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses to increase as a result of our acquisition and integration of Bit-isle and as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth.Acquisition Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $64.2 million primarily attributed to the EMEA region due to the acquisitions of Telecity and the Paris IBX Data Center. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $41.7 million primarily attributed to the EMEA region, and to a lesser degree, to the Asia-Pacific region.Impairment Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded impairment charges totaling $7.7 million in the Asia-Pacific region relating to assets held for sale. We did not have impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2015.Gain on Asset Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a gain on asset sales of $32.8 million primarily relating to the sale of the LD2 data center in the EMEA region and a parcel of land in San Jose in the Americas region. We did not have any gain on asset sales during the year ended December 31, 2015.Income from Operations. Our income from operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2016 % 2015 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$352,180 57% $324,458 57% 9% 9%EMEA124,853 20% 145,527 26% (14)% (11)%Asia-Pacific141,706 23% 97,357 17% 46% 44%Total$618,739 100% $567,342 100% 9% 10%Americas Income from Operations. The increase in our Americas income from continuing operations was due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above as well as the gain recognized on the sale of the San Jose land parcel, partially offset by higher cost of revenues and operating expenses primarily attributable to higher compensation and other headcount related expenses to support our growth. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Americas income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2015. EMEA Income from Operations. The decrease in our EMEA income from continuing operations was primarily due to acquisition and integration costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of TelecityGroup, which closed in January 2016, as well as the increased depreciation and amortization created from the purchase accounting for TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, partially offset by the gain recognized on the sale of the LD2 data center. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $5.2 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA income from continuing operations primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.Asia-Pacific Income from Operations. The increase in our Asia-Pacific income from continuing operations was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our acquisition and integration of Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015, as well as our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by the impairment charges, higher cost of revenues and operating expenses primarily attributable to our acquisition of Bit-isle as well as higher compensation and other headcount related expenses and higher professional fees to support our growth. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest Income. Interest income was $3.5 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 0.37% versus 0.38% for the year ended December 31, 50Table of Contents2015. We expect our interest income to remain at these low levels for the foreseeable future due to lower invested balances and a portfolio more weighted towards money market funds.Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $392.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $299.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase in interest expense was primarily due to the impact of our $1.1 billion of senior notes issued in December 2015, $614.7 million outstanding in seven-year term loans we borrowed in January 2016 and $406.6 million outstanding in five-year term loans we borrowed in October 2016, replacing a bridge term loan facility we borrowed to finance our acquisition of Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015, as well as additional financings such as various capital lease and other financing obligations to support our expansion projects. The increase in interest expense is partially offset by the settlement of the 4.75% convertible debt in June 2016. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we capitalized $13.3 million and $10.9 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. Going forward, we expect to incur higher interest expense as we borrowed the €1.0 billion Term B-2 Loan in January 2017. We also expect to incur additional indebtedness to support our growth and acquisition opportunities including the Verizon Asset Purchase, resulting in higher interest expense going forward. Other Income (Expense). We recorded net other expense of $57.9 million and $60.6 million for the years December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses during the periods.Loss on Debt Extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $12.3 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the settlement of the financing obligations for our Paris 3 IBX data center, a portion of the lender fees associated with the Japanese Yen Term Loan, and the prepayment and termination of our 2012 and 2013 Brazil financings. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a $0.3 million loss on debt extinguishment which was attributable to partial conversions of our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes in December 2015.Income Taxes. Effective January 1, 2015, we have operated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income distributed to our stockholders. We intend to distribute the entire taxable income generated by the operations of our REIT and its QRSs for the tax years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. As such, no provision for U.S. income taxes for the REIT and its QRSs has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. We have made TRS elections for some of our subsidiaries in and outside the U.S. In general, a TRS may provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs to provide and may hold assets that REITs cannot hold directly. U.S. income taxes for the TRS entities located in the U.S. and foreign income taxes for our foreign operations regardless of whether the foreign operations are operated as a QRS or TRS have been accrued, as necessary, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded $45.5 million and $23.2 million of income tax expenses, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 28.4% and 11.0%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily due to higher profits in the domestic TRS and larger amount of non-deductible interest expenses within our EMEA operations. We recorded excess income tax benefits of $2,773,000 and $30,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets.Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a key factor in how we assess the operating performance of our segments and develop regional growth strategies such as IBX data center expansion decisions. We define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs and gain on asset sales. See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below for more information about adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to income or loss from operations. Our adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2016 % 2015 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$787,311 47% $698,604 55% 13% 13%EMEA494,263 30% 318,561 25% 55% 59%Asia-Pacific375,900 23% 254,462 20% 48% 46%Total$1,657,474 100% $1,271,627 100% 30% 31%51Table of ContentsAmericas Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our Americas adjusted EBITDA was due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above. During the year ended December 31, 2016, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $2.2 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Americas adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.EMEA Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for our EMEA region includes $189.0 million of adjusted EBITDA attributable to our acquisition of TelecityGroup, which closed in January 2016, and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, which closed in August 2016. Excluding adjusted EBITDA attributable to TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, the decrease in our EMEA adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher operating costs as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above and integration costs relating to TelecityGroup acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2016, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $10.7 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA adjusted EBITDA primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.Asia-Pacific Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for our Asia-Pacific region includes $50.3 million and $5.2 million of adjusted EBITDA attributable to our acquisition of Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding adjusted EBITDA attributable to Bit-isle, the increase in our Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Japanese Yen than during the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in approximately $4.1 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2015. Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014Revenues.

Growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to (i) $44.5 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers and IBX data center expansions in the Dallas, New York, Rio de Janeiro, Silicon Valley, Toronto and Washington DC metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. During the year ended 52Table of ContentsDecember 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $37.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Americas revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. EMEA Revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our revenues from the United Kingdom, the largest revenue contributor in the EMEA region for the periods, represented approximately 37% and 36%, respectively, of the regional revenues. Our EMEA revenue growth was due to (i) $23.6 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers and IBX data center expansions in the Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, and Paris metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. During the year ended December 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $94.1 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA revenues primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound and Euro during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Asia-Pacific Revenues. Our revenues from Singapore, the largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, represented approximately 37% and 38% of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Our Asia-Pacific revenue growth was due to (i) $58.8 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers and IBX data center expansions in the Hong Kong, Melbourne, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period as reflected in the growth in our utilization rate, as discussed above, in both our new and existing IBX data centers. In addition, our Asia-Pacific revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $21.6 million of revenue attributable to our acquisition of Bit-isle, which closed on November 2, 2015.

These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts and, as a result, our EMEA sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues have increased. We expect our EMEA sales and marketing expenses to further increase as a result of the TelecityGroup acquisition.Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $2.2 million of sales and marketing expenses attributable to our acquisition of Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015. Excluding Bit-isle, Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses were $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $43.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses, excluding Bit-isle, was primarily due to $3.6 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, commission and stock-based compensation as a result of business and headcount growth (183 Asia-Pacific sales and marketing employees, excluding Bit-isle employees, versus 155 as of December 31, 2014). During the year ended December 31, 2015, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $3.6 million of net favorable impact on our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts and, as a result, our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses have increased. We expect our APAC sales and marketing expenses to further increase as a result of the Bit-Isle acquisition. General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2015 % 2014 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$347,421 70% $315,533 72% 10% 11%EMEA92,803 19% 79,942 18% 16% 26%Asia-Pacific53,060 11% 42,541 10% 25% 35%Total$493,284 100% $438,016 100% 13% 16% Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014General and Administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues: Americas23% 23%EMEA13% 13%Asia-Pacific10% 10%Total18% 18%Americas General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $15.0 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation as a result of headcount growth (800 Americas general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2015 versus 731 as of December 31, 2014), (ii) $17.0 million of higher depreciation expenses primarily associated with the implementation of the Oracle R12 ERP system and certain systems to support the REIT conversion and (iii) $10.9 million of higher office expenses, travel, entertainment, and rent and facility costs, in support of our business growth, partially offset by an $11.3 million reduction in professional fees related to our REIT conversion as compared to those incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $3.2 million of net favorable foreign currency impact on our Americas general and administrative expenses primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Over the course of the past year, we have been investing in our Americas general and administrative functions to scale this region effectively for growth, which has included additional investments into improving our back office systems. We expect our current efforts to improve our back office systems will continue over the next several years.55Table of ContentsEMEA General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our EMEA general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) approximately $4.2 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation as a result of headcount growth (420 EMEA general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2015 versus 353 as of December 31, 2014), (ii) $4.3 million of higher depreciation expenses due to implementation of the Oracle R12 ERP system and certain systems to support the REIT conversion and (iii) $2.8 million of higher consulting costs primarily due to integration efforts in connection with our acquisition of TelecityGroup as well as an increase in net losses related to cash flow hedging derivatives. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $7.8 million of net favorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA general and administrative expenses primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound and Euro during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $5.8 million of general and administrative expenses attributable to our acquisition of Bit-isle, which closed on November 2, 2015. Excluding general and administrative expenses attributable to Bit-isle, Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $47.3 million compared to $42.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding general and administrative expenses attributable to Bit-isle, the increase in our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a $2.2 million increase in consulting costs, legal fees and other costs for tax-related matters as well as higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation as a result of headcount growth (266 Asia-Pacific general and administrative employees, excluding Bit-isle employees, as of December 31, 2015 versus 224 as of December 31, 2014). During the year ended December 31, 2015, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $3.4 million of net favorable impact on our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.Acquisition Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $41.7 million primarily attributed to the EMEA region, and to a lesser degree, to the Asia-Pacific region. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $2.5 million primarily attributed to the EMEA regions.Income from Operations. Our income from operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2015 % 2014 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$324,458 57% $282,219 56% 15% 15%EMEA145,527 26% 138,685 27% 5% 23%Asia-Pacific97,357 17% 88,362 17% 10% 24%Total$567,342 100% $509,266 100% 11% 19%Americas Income from Operations. The increase in our Americas income from operations was due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation and other headcount related expenses to support our growth. EMEA Income from Operations. The increase in our EMEA income from operations was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above. During the year ended December 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $25.6 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA income from operations primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pounds and Euro during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.Asia-Pacific Income from Operations. The increase in our Asia-Pacific income from operations was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation and other headcount related expenses and higher professional fees to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $17.5 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Asia-Pacific income from operations primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.56Table of ContentsInterest Income. Interest income was $3.6 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 0.38% versus 0.33% for the year ended December 31, 2014.Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $299.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $270.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase in interest expense was primarily due to the full impact recognized for the year ended December 31, 2015 of our $1.25 billion senior notes offering in November 2014, the $0.5 billion Term loan A we borrowed in December 2014 under our senior credit facility and $18 million of higher interest expense from various capital lease and other financing obligations to support our expansion projects, which was partially offset by the redemption of our 7.00% senior notes in December 2014, the settlement of the 3.00% convertible notes and the partial redemption of the 4.75% convertible notes in June 2014. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we capitalized $10.9 million and $19.0 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress.Other Income (Expense). We recorded net expense of $60.6 million and net income of $0.1 million for the years December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains and losses during the periods. The expense recorded in 2015 is primarily attributed to foreign currency losses to fund the TelecityGroup acquisition purchase price.Loss on Debt Extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a $0.3 million loss on debt extinguishment which was attributable to partial conversions of our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes in December 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a $157.0 million loss on debt extinguishment, of which $51.2 million was attributable to the exchanges of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes and 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, $103.3 million was attributable to the redemption of our $750.0 million 7.00% senior notes and $2.5 million was attributable to the prepayment and termination of our $750.0 million multicurrency credit facility. For additional information, see “Loss on Debt Extinguishment” in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Income Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded $23.2 million and $345.5 million of income tax expenses, respectively. We recognized a significantly lower income tax provision in 2015 as compared to the income tax provision in 2014 primarily due to the de-recognition, in 2014, of the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our U.S. operations upon conversion to a REIT. The $345.5 million of income tax expense recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to the statutory tax rate change due to our REIT conversion, which resulted in a $324.1 million domestic deferred tax assets write-off. In connection with the formal approval of our conversion to a REIT by our Board of Directors in December 2014, we reassessed, in the fourth quarter of 2014, the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our U.S. operations to be included in the REIT structure. The reevaluation resulted in de-recognizing the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our REIT’s U.S. operations, excluding the deferred tax liabilities associated with the depreciation and amortization recapture expected in 2015. The de-recognition of the deferred tax assets and liabilities of our REIT’s U.S. operations occurred because the expected recovery or settlement of the related assets and liabilities will not result in deductible or taxable amounts in any post-REIT conversion periods. The deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with our foreign operations, regardless of whether such foreign operations were part of the REIT conversion, are not subject to the de-recognition assessment. We generally do not expect our occasional sale of assets to result in a material tax liability.Our effective tax rates were 11.0% and 407.7%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to tax expense attributable to the $324.1 million domestic deferred tax assets write-off as a result of our REIT conversion. Excluding this tax expense, our effective tax rate would have been 25.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Due to our REIT conversion, we are entitled to a deduction for dividends paid, which results in a substantial reduction of U.S income tax expense. As a REIT, substantially all of our income tax expense is the foreign income tax incurred by our foreign subsidiaries and the U.S. income tax expense incurred by our U.S. TRSs. We recorded excess income tax benefits of $30,000 and $18.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets.57Table of ContentsAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a key factor in how we assess the operating performance of our segments and develop regional growth strategies such as IBX data center expansion decisions. We define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs and gain on asset sales. See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below for more information about adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to income or loss from operations. Our adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2015 % 2014 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$698,604 55% $635,007 57% 10% 12%EMEA318,561 25% 269,222 24% 18% 35%Asia-Pacific254,462 20% 209,662 19% 21% 34%Total$1,271,627 100% $1,113,891 100% 14% 22%Americas Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our Americas adjusted EBITDA was due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by higher adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation and other headcount related expenses to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $12.2 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Americas adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. EMEA Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our EMEA adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above. During the year ended December 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $45.4 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our EMEA adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pounds and Euro during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.Asia-Pacific Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by higher adjusted operating expenses as percentages of revenues primarily attributable to higher compensation and other headcount related expenses and higher professional fees to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2015, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $26.1 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe provide all information required in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), but we believe that evaluating our ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, we use non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operations. Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We have presented such non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and ability to perform in subsequent periods. We believe that if we did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze Equinix effectively. Investors should note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by us may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. Investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing non-GAAP financial measures used by us to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. Our primary non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”), exclude depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of our IBX data centers and do not reflect 58Table of Contentsour current or future cash spending levels to support our business. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of an IBX data center do not recur with respect to such data center, although we may incur initial construction costs in future periods with respect to additional IBX data centers, and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to our initial investment. This is a trend we expect to continue. In addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of our IBX data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs incurred to build out our IBX data centers and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. Therefore, we exclude depreciation from our operating results when evaluating our operations. In addition, in presenting adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, we exclude amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense is significantly affected by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions and these charges may vary in amount from period to period. We exclude amortization expense to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our prior periods. We exclude accretion expense, both as it relates to asset retirement obligations as well as accrued restructuring charge liabilities, as these expenses represent costs which we believe are not meaningful in evaluating our current operations. We exclude stock-based compensation expense, as it can vary significantly from period to period based on share price, the timing, size and nature of equity awards. As such, we, and many investors and analysts, exclude this stock-based compensation expense to compare our operating results with those of other companies. We also exclude restructuring charges. The restructuring charges relate to our decisions to exit leases for excess space adjacent to several of our IBX data centers, which we did not intend to build out, or our decision to reverse such restructuring charges. We also exclude impairment charges related to certain long-lived assets. The impairment charges are related to expense recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets are not recoverable. We also exclude gains on asset sales as it represents profit that is not meaningful in evaluating the current or future operating performance. Finally, we exclude acquisition costs from AFFO and adjusted EBITDA to allow more comparable comparisons of our financial results to our historical operations. The acquisition costs relate to costs we incur in connection with business combinations. Such charges generally are not relevant to assessing the long-term performance of the company. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions. Management believes items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, gains on asset sales and acquisition costs are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs may occur in future periods.Adjusted EBITDAWe define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs, and gain on asset sales as presented below (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014Income from operations$618,739 $567,342 $509,266Depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense843,510 528,929 484,129Stock-based compensation expense156,148 133,633 117,990Acquisition costs64,195 41,723 2,506Impairment charges7,698 — —Gain on asset sales(32,816) — —Adjusted EBITDA$1,657,474 $1,271,627 $1,113,891Our adjusted EBITDA results have improved each year and in each region in total dollars due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in “Results of Operations”, as well as the nature of our business model consisting of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature also discussed earlier in “Overview”.Funds from Operations (“FFO”) and AFFOWe use FFO and AFFO, which are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in the REIT industry. FFO is calculated in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). FFO represents net income (loss), excluding gain (loss) from the disposition of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures’ and non-controlling interests’ share of these items. We use AFFO to evaluate our performance on a consolidated basis and as a metric in the determination of employees’ annual bonuses beginning in 2015 and vesting of restricted stock units that were granted beginning in 2015 and that have both service and performance conditions. In presenting AFFO, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future operating performance. AFFO represents FFO excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate assets, 59Table of Contentsaccretion, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs, gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and noncontrolling interests’ share of these items, gain on asset sales and net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax. The adjustments for both installation revenue and straight-line rent expense are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight-lined or amortized results in the consolidated statement of operations. We exclude the amortization of deferred financing costs as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings that have no current or future cash obligations. We exclude gain (loss) on debt extinguishment since it generally represents the write-off of initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings or a cost that is incurred to reduce future interest costs and is not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance. We include an income tax expense adjustment, which represents the non-cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes that do not relate to current period’s operations. We deduct recurring capital expenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of its IBX centers or other assets that are required to support current revenues. We also exclude net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, which represents results that may not recur and are not a good indicator of our current future operating performance.60Table of ContentsOur FFO and AFFO were as follows (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014Net income (loss)$126,800 $187,774 $(260,726)Net loss attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests— — 1,179Net income (loss) attributable to Equinix126,800 187,774 (259,547)Adjustments: Real estate depreciation and amortization626,564 439,969 417,703(Gain) loss on disposition of real estate property(28,388) 1,382 301Adjustments for FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures113 113 112Non-controlling interests' share of above adjustments— — (5,303)NAREIT FFO attributable to common stockholders$725,089 $629,238 $153,266 Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014NAREIT FFO attributable to common stockholders$725,089 $629,238 $153,266Adjustments: Installation revenue adjustment20,161 35,498 25,720Straight-line rent expense adjustment7,700 7,931 13,048Amortization of deferred financing costs18,696 16,135 19,020Stock-based compensation expense156,149 133,633 117,990Non-real estate depreciation expense87,781 58,165 36,232Amortization expense122,862 27,446 27,756Accretion expense6,303 3,349 2,438Recurring capital expenditures(141,819) (120,281) (105,366)Loss on debt extinguishment12,276 289 156,990Acquisition costs64,195 41,723 2,506Impairment charges7,698 — —Net income from discontinued operations, net of tax(12,392) — —Income tax expense adjustment3,680 (1,270) 315,289Adjustments for AFFO from unconsolidated joint ventures(40) (58) (76)Non-controlling interests' share of above adjustments— — (3,134)AFFO$1,078,339 $831,798 $761,679Our AFFO results have improved due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in “Results of Operations,” as well as due to the nature of our business model which consists of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature as discussed earlier in “Overview.” Constant Currency PresentationOur revenues and certain operating expenses (cost of revenues, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses) from our international operations have represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues and certain operating expenses. As a result, our revenues and certain operating expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. dollar against major international currencies such as the Euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar, Australian dollar and Brazilian real. In order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present period-over-period percentage changes in our revenues and certain operating expenses on a constant currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, we have presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results. To present this information, our current and comparative prior period revenues 61Table of Contentsand certain operating expenses from entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2015 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2016 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2016 with the year ended December 31, 2015, and average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2014 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2015 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2015 with the year ended December 31, 2014). Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of December 31, 2016, our total indebtedness was comprised of debt and financing obligations totaling approximately $6,821.6 million consisting of (a) approximately $3,850.0 million of principal from our senior notes, (b) approximately $1,511.8 million from our capital lease and other financing obligations, and (c) $1,459.8 million of principal from our mortgage and other loans payable (gross of discount and premium).We believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of the current portion of our debt as it becomes due, payment of regular dividend distributions and completion of our publicly-announced expansion projects. As of December 31, 2016, we had $761.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, of which approximately $380.8 million was held in the U.S. We believe that our current expansion activities can be funded with our cash and cash equivalents and investments. On December 6, 2016, we entered into a transaction agreement with Verizon to acquire Verizon's colocation services business at 24 data center sites located in the United States, Brazil and Colombia for a cash purchase price of $3,600.0 million. We expect to fund the acquisition with a combination of cash on hand, proceeds from the €1,000.0 million Term B-2 Loan which we borrowed in full on January 6, 2017 (see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), and proceeds from future debt and equity financings. In connection with the Verizon Asset Purchase, we entered into a commitment letter to provide a senior unsecured bridge facility in the aggregate principal amount of $2,000.0 million for the purpose of funding a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.As of December 31, 2016, we had 30 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $50.5 million issued and outstanding under the revolving credit facility; as a result of these letters of credit, we had a total of approximately $1,449.5 million of additional liquidity available to us under the revolving credit facility. Besides any further financing activities we may pursue, customer collections are our primary source of cash. While we believe we have a strong customer base, and have continued to experience relatively strong collections, if the current market conditions were to deteriorate, some of our customers may have difficulty paying us and we may experience increased churn in our customer base, including reductions in their commitments to us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Additionally, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build out of new IBX data centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as potential acquisitions. While we expect to fund these plans with our existing resources, additional financing, either debt or equity, may be required, and if current market conditions were to deteriorate, we may be unable to secure additional financing or any such additional financing may only be available to us on unfavorable terms. An inability to pursue additional expansion opportunities will have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our desired level of revenue growth in future periods.We completed our conversion to a REIT in 2014 and began operating as a REIT effective January 1, 2015. As a result of our conversion to a REIT, we made special distributions to our stockholders in 2015 and 2014. The distributions were payable in common stock or cash at the election of our stockholders, with the cash portion of the distributions subject to certain maximum amounts. As a result of the special distributions, we paid a total of $125.5 million in 2015 and $83.3 million in 2014 and distributed 1.7 million and 1.5 million shares of common stock in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Also as a result of our conversion to a REIT, we began paying quarterly dividends in 2015. We paid an aggregate of $499.5 million of quarterly cash dividends during 2016 and $521.5 million of quarterly cash dividends and special distribution during 2015.Sources and Uses of Cash Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (in thousands)Net cash provided by operating activities$1,016,580 $894,793 $689,420Net cash used in investing activities(1,592,155) (1,134,927) (435,839)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities(894,292) 1,873,182 107,40162Table of ContentsOperating ActivitiesThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to improved operating results combined with incremental operating cash provided by the acquisition of TelecityGroup in January 2016 and inclusion of full year operating results of Bit-isle. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to improved operating results. Investing ActivitiesThe increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the increase in spending for the acquisitions of TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center of $1,521.4 million, net of cash acquired, over prior year acquisition spending, a decrease in sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases, of $503.3 million and $245.2 million of higher capital expenditures, primarily a result of expansion activity. These uses were partially offset by proceeds from sales of assets of $851.6 million, net of cash transferred, and changes in restricted cash totaling $950.9 million related primarily to the TelecityGroup acquisition. The increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a $513.9 million increase in restricted cash, primarily in connection with our cash and share offer for TelecityGroup, $245.6 million, net of cash for our acquisition of Bit-isle and Nimbo, $207.9 million of higher capital expenditures primarily as a result of expansion activity and $21.5 million of higher purchases of real estate, partially offset by $187.0 million of lower purchase of investments and $87.6 million of higher sales and maturities of investment. During 2017, we expect to complete the acquisition of Verizon's data center sites located in the United States, Brazil and Colombia. We also anticipate our IBX expansion construction activity will be approximately the same as our 2016 levels. If the opportunity to expand is greater than planned and we have sufficient funding to pursue such expansion opportunities, we may further increase the level of capital expenditures to support this growth as well as pursue additional business acquisitions, property acquisitions or joint ventures.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities during 2016 was primarily due to (i) $1,462.9 million repayment of loans payable including repayment of loans assumed in the TelecityGroup acquisition, bridge term loan and revolving credit facility, (ii) $114.4 million repayment of capital lease and other financing obligations and (iii) $499.5 million payment of dividends, partially offset by (iv) $1,168.3 million of proceeds from loans payable including proceeds from our Term Loan B and Japanese Yen Term Loan. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2015 was primarily due to (i) $1,100.0 million of gross proceeds from the senior notes offering in December 2015, (ii) $829.5 million of net proceeds from our public offering of common stock in November 2015, (iii) $1,197.1 million of proceeds from loans payable including proceeds from our term loan modification, our bridge term loan and our revolving credit facility, partially offset by (iv) $715.3 million repayment of mortgage and loans payable including repayment of $171.2 million of loans assumed in the Bit-isle acquisition and repayment of $544.1 million of U.S. dollar-denominated term loan and other mortgage and loan payments, (v) $396.0 million of quarterly dividend distributions and (vi) $125.5 million of special distributions. The net cash provided by financing activities for 2014 was primarily due to $1,250.00 million of proceeds from the senior notes offering in November 2014, $500.0 million of proceeds from the term loan facility, partially offset by (i) $1,100.0 million for repayment of debt including $750.0 million for the redemption of the 7.00% senior notes, prepayment of the remaining principal balance of the U.S. term loan of $110.0 million, $43.5 million for repayments of mortgage and other loan payable, and $29.5 million for the exchanges of the 3.00% convertible subordinated notes and 4.75% convertible subordinated notes, (ii) $298.0 million for the purchases of treasury stock, (iii) $226.3 million for the purchase of Riverwood’s interest in ALOG and the approximate 10% of ALOG owned by ALOG management and (iv) $83.3 million for the cash portion of the special distribution. Going forward, we expect that our financing activities will consist primarily of repayment of our debt and additional financings needed to support expansion opportunities, additional acquisitions or joint ventures and the payment of our regular cash dividends.Debt ObligationsDebt FacilitiesWe have various debt obligations with maturity dates ranging from 2017 to 2026 under which a total principal balance of $5,309.8 million remained outstanding (gross of debt issuance cost and discounts) as of December 31, 2016. For further information on debt obligations, see “Debt Facilities” in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.63Table of ContentsCapital Lease and Other Financing ObligationsWe have numerous capital lease and other financing obligations with maturity dates ranging from 2017 to 2053 under which a total principal balance of $1,511.8 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2016 with a weighted average effective interest rate of 7.96%. For further information on our capital leases and other financing obligations, see “Capital Leases and Other Financing Obligations” in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet ArrangementsWe lease a majority of our IBX data centers and certain equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements expiring through 2065.

Other contractual commitments are described below.(6)Represents liability, net of future accretion expense.In connection with certain of our leases and other contracts requiring deposits, we entered into 30 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $50.5 million under the revolving credit facility. These letters of credit were provided in lieu of cash deposits. If the landlords for these IBX leases decide to draw down on these letters of credit triggered by an event of default under the lease, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowing under the revolving credit facility. These contingent commitments are not reflected in the table above.We had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaling approximately $53.3 million as of December 31, 2016. These liabilities, which are reflected on our balance sheet, are not reflected in the table above since it is unclear when these liabilities will be paid.Primarily as a result of our various IBX data center expansion projects, as of December 31, 2016, we were contractually committed for $234.4 million of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for IBX equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided in connection with the work necessary to complete construction and open these IBX data centers prior to making them available to customers for installation. This amount, which is expected to be paid during 2017 and thereafter, is reflected in the table above as “other contractual commitments.”We had other non-capital purchase commitments in place as of December 31, 2016, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods or services to be delivered or provided during 2017 and beyond. Such other purchase commitments as of December 31, 2016, which total $304.9 million, are also reflected in the table above as “other contractual commitments.”64Table of ContentsIn addition, although we are not contractually obligated to do so, we expect to incur additional capital expenditures of approximately $634.7 million to $734.7 million, in addition to the $539.3 million in contractual commitments discussed above as of December 31, 2016, for our various IBX data center expansion projects during 2017 and thereafter in order to complete the work needed to open these IBX data centers. These non-contractual capital expenditures are not reflected in the table above. If we so choose, whether due to economic factors or other considerations, we could delay these non-contractual capital expenditure commitments to preserve liquidity.On January 6, 2017, we borrowed the full amount of the €1.0 billion Term B-2 Loan, which is not reflected in the table above.Other Off-Balance-Sheet ArrangementsWe have various guarantor arrangements with both our directors and officers and third parties, including customers, vendors and business partners. As of December 31, 2016, there were no significant liabilities recorded for these arrangements. For additional information, see “Guarantor Arrangements” in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require significant judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain:•Accounting for income taxes;•Accounting for business combinations;•Accounting for impairment of goodwill; and•Accounting for property, plant and equipment.65Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ From AssumptionsAccounting for Income Taxes.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or settled. The accounting standard for income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined by the accounting standard as a likelihood of more than 50%) that such assets will not be realized.A tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authority’s widely understood administrative practices and precedents.The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future events. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. If, based on the weight of that available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified.This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account a number of types of evidence, including the following: 1) the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, 2) sources of future taxable income and 3) tax planning strategies.In assessing the tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position, the tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded a total of net deferred tax liabilities of $212.0 million and $39.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had a total valuation allowance of $29.2 million and $29.9 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we decided to release the valuation allowances related to the historical data center operations in Japan. This reduction in valuation allowance was partially offset by the full valuation allowance setups in Brazil and Canada as well as the change in valuation allowances in Europe due to the TelecityGroup acquisition and integration. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we decided to provide a partial release of valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets associated with certain foreign operating entities, which resulted in an insignificant income tax benefit in our consolidated results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our decision to release our valuation allowances in Japan was due to the tax free merger of Bit-isle into Equinix Japan on January 1, 2017. This results in an overall net deferred tax liability position for the surviving entity so that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets can be realized via deferred tax liability reversal. Our decision to release our valuation allowances in other jurisdiction was based on our belief that the operations of these jurisdictions had achieved a sufficient level of profitability and will sustain a sufficient level of profitability in the future to support the release of these valuation allowances based on relevant facts and circumstances. However, if our assumptions on the future performance of these jurisdictions prove not to be correct and these jurisdictions are not able to sustain a sufficient level of profitability to support the associated deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet, we will have to impair our deferred tax assets through an additional valuation allowance, which would impact our financial position and results of operations in the period such a determination is made.Our remaining valuation allowance as of December 31, 2016 was $29.2 million and relates to certain of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. If and when we reduce our remaining valuation allowances, it will have a favorable impact to our financial position and results of operations in the periods such determinations are made. We will continue to assess the need for our valuation allowances, by country or location, in the future.As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $72.2 million and $30.8 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the unrecognized tax benefits increased by $41.4 million primarily due to the TelecityGroup acquisition and integration. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $5.3 million primarily due to an agreement with Dutch Tax Authorities on the availability of historical loss carry-forwards to offset future profits generated by the Dutch fiscal unity. The unrecognized tax benefits of $72.2 million as of December 31, 2016, if subsequently recognized, will affect our effective tax rate favorably at the time when such benefits are recognized. 66Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ From AssumptionsAccounting for Business CombinationsIn accordance with the accounting standard for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets such as customer contracts, leases and any other significant assets or liabilities and contingent consideration. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date if we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires assumptions and management’s judgment to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. During the last three years, we have completed four business combinations, including the Paris IBX data center acquisition in August 2016, TelecityGroup acquisition in January 2016, Bit-isle acquisition in November 2015, and Nimbo acquisition in January 2015.The purchase price allocation for the TelecityGroup and Bit-isle acquisitions were completed in the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we used to complete the purchase price allocations and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, which would be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in 2017 or beyond. Accounting for Impairment of GoodwillIn accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform goodwill impairment reviews annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we elected to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test. We completed annual goodwill impairment assessment of the Americas reporting unit, the EMEA reporting unit and the Asia-Pacific reporting unit and concluded that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values. Goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform step two of goodwill impairment test.In 2016, we elected to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test, we used both the income and market approach. The income approach is based on the ten-year business plan. We apply the weighted-average cost of capital applicable to our reporting units as discount rates. This requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. The market approach requires judgment in determining the appropriate market comparables.In 2015, we elected to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value requires assumptions and estimates before performing the two-step goodwill impairment test, the assessment requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data.These assumptions require significant management judgment and are inherently subject to uncertainties. As of December 31, 2016, goodwill attributable to the Americas reporting unit, the EMEA reporting unit and the Asia-Pacific reporting unit was $469.4 million, $2.3 billion and $235.3 million, respectively. Future events, changing market conditions and any changes in key assumptions may result in an impairment charge. While we have not recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill to date, the development of adverse business conditions in our Americas, EMEA or Asia-Pacific reporting units, such as higher than anticipated customer churn or significantly increased operating costs, or significant deterioration of our market comparables that we use in the market approach, could result in an impairment charge in future periods. Any potential impairment charge against our goodwill would not exceed the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.67Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ From AssumptionsAccounting for Property, Plant and EquipmentWe have a substantial amount of property, plant and equipment recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The vast majority of our property, plant and equipment represent the costs incurred to build out or acquire our IBX data centers. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets. The majority of our IBX data centers are in properties that are leased. We depreciate our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (subject to the term of the lease in the case of leased assets or leasehold improvements and integral equipment located in leased properties). Accounting for property, plant and equipment includes determining the appropriate period in which to depreciate such assets, making assessments for leased properties to determine whether they are capital or operating leases, determining if construction projects performed at leased properties trigger build-to-suit lease accounting, assessing such assets for potential impairment, capitalizing interest during periods of construction and assessing the asset retirement obligations required for certain leased properties that require us to return the leased properties back to their original condition at the time we decide to exit a leased property.While there are numerous judgments and uncertainties involved in accounting for property, plant and equipment that are significant, arriving at the estimated useful life of an asset requires the most critical judgment for us and changes to these estimates would have the most significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. When we lease a property for our IBX data centers, we generally enter into long-term arrangements with initial lease terms of at least 8-10 years and with renewal options generally available to us. During the next several years, a number of leases for our IBX data centers will come up for renewal. As we start approaching the end of these initial lease terms, we will need to reassess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment. In addition, we may find that our estimates for the useful lives of non-leased assets may also need to be revised periodically. We periodically review the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment and changes in these estimates in the future are possible. Another area of judgment for us in connection with our property, plant and equipment is related to lease accounting. Most of our IBX data centers are leased. Each time we enter into a new lease or lease amendment for one of our IBX data centers, we analyze each lease or lease amendment for the proper accounting. This requires certain judgments on our part such as establishing the lease term to include in a lease test, establishing the remaining estimated useful life of the underlying property or equipment and estimating the fair value of the underlying property or equipment and establishing the incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payment for the lease test. All of these judgments are inherently uncertain. Different assumptions or estimates could result in a different accounting treatment for a lease.The assessment of long-lived assets for impairment requires assumptions and estimates of undiscounted and discounted future cash flows. These assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and are inherently uncertain.We did not revise the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. During the quarter ended December 31, 2014, we revised the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment. As a result, we recorded an insignificant amount of higher depreciation expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 due to the reduction of the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment. We undertook this review due to our determination that we were generally using certain of our existing assets over a shorter period than originally anticipated and, therefore, the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment has been shortened. This change was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis effective October 1, 2014 under the accounting standard for change in accounting estimates. As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had property, plant and equipment of $7.2 billion, $5.6 billion, and $5.0 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded depreciation expense of $714.3 million, $498.1 million, and $453.9 million, respectively. Further changes in our estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment could have a significant impact on our results of operations.As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had property, plant and equipment under capital leases and other financing obligations of $1.6 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded depreciation expense of $61.9 million, $52.9 million, and $43.2 million, respectively, related to property, plant and equipment under capital leases and other financing obligations. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we recorded interest expense of $120.7 million, $104.4 million, $86.4 million, respectively, related to property, plant, equipment, under capital leases and other financing obligations. Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded rent expense of $140.6 million, $101.5 million, and $105.4 million under operating leases. Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.68Table of ContentsITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket Risk The following discussion about market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity.We employ foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging certain specifically-identified exposures. The use of these financial instruments is intended to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, but does not eliminate such risks. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Investment Portfolio RiskWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities that is prioritized on meeting REIT asset requirements. All of our marketable securities are designated as available-for-sale and, therefore, are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax. We consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge for our securities, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. We anticipate that we will recover the entire cost basis of these securities and have determined that no other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were required to be recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016.As of December 31, 2016, our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market funds, certificates of deposits and publicly traded equity securities. The amount in our investment portfolio that could be susceptible to market risk totaled $413.8 million.Interest Rate Risk Our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk which meets asset measurement requirements for REIT qualification. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates or credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Securities with longer maturities are subject to a greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities. As of December 31, 2016, the average duration of our portfolio was less than one year. An immediate hypothetical shift in the yield curves of plus or minus 50 basis points from their position as of December 31, 2016 would not have a material impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift of all interest rates, however, interest rates do not always move in such a manner and actual results may differ materially. We monitor our interest rate and credit risk, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers. There were no impairment charges on our cash equivalents and fixed income securities during the year ended December 31, 2016.An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates from their position as of December 31, 2016 would not have a material impact on our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of the majority of our debt obligations. However, the interest expense associated with our term loans and Japanese Yen term loan, which bear interest at variable rates, could be affected. Based on our debt that was outstanding as of December 31, 2016, for every 100 basis point increase in interest rates, our annual interest expense could increase by a total of approximately $13.9 million. Based on our debt that was outstanding as of December 31, 2016, for every 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, our annual interest expense could decrease by a total of approximately $2.5 million based on the total balance of our primary borrowings under the term loan A and B facilities and Japanese Yen term loan as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had not employed any interest rate derivative products against our debt obligations. However, we may enter into interest rate hedging agreements in the future to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk.The fair value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate changes may affect the fair value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair value of our convertible debt, which was traded in the market, was based on quoted market prices. The fair value of our loans payable, which are not traded in the market, is estimated by considering our credit rating, current rates available to us for debt of the same remaining maturities and the terms of the debt. The following table represents the carrying value and estimated fair value of our loans payable, senior notes and convertible debt as of (in thousands):69Table of Contents December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 Carrying Value (1) Fair Value Carrying Value (1) Fair ValueMortgage and loans payable$1,459,826 $1,461,954 $920,064 $916,602Convertible debt— — 150,082 151,997Senior notes3,850,000 4,033,985 3,850,000 3,954,000Revolving credit facility— — 325,622 325,617___________________(1)The carrying value is gross of debt issuance cost and discount.Foreign Currency Risk A significant portion of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, however, approximately 57.1% of our revenues and 59.7% of our operating costs are attributable to Brazil, Canada and the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions and a large portion of those revenues and costs are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Australian dollar and Brazilian real. To help manage the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we have implemented a number of hedging programs, in particular (i) a cash flow hedging program to hedge the forecasted revenues and expenses in our EMEA region, (ii) a balance sheet hedging program to hedge the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, and (iii) a net investment hedging program to hedge the long term investments in our foreign subsidiaries. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements and its impact on the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2016, the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of up to two years.For the foreseeable future, we anticipate that approximately 50% or less of our revenues and operating costs will continue to be generated and incurred outside of the U.S. in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. During fiscal 2016, the U.S. dollar became generally stronger relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate. This overall strength of the U.S. dollar had a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations because the foreign denominations translated into less U.S. dollars. In future periods, the volatility of the U.S. dollar as compared to the other currencies in which we do business could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations including the amount of revenue that we report in future periods.With the existing cash flow hedges in place, a hypothetical additional 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2016 would have resulted in a reduction of our revenues and operating expenses for the year by approximately $119.2 million and $138.5 million, respectively.We may enter into additional hedging activities in the future to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency risk as our exposure to foreign currency risk continues to increase due to our growing foreign operations; however, we do not currently intend to eliminate all foreign currency transaction exposure. Commodity Price RiskCertain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of price changes are electricity, supplies and equipment used in our IBX data centers. We closely monitor the cost of electricity at all of our locations. We have entered into several power contracts to purchase power at fixed prices during 2014 and beyond in certain locations in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom.In addition, as we are building new, or expanding existing, IBX data centers, we are subject to commodity price risk for building materials related to the construction of these IBX data centers, such as steel and copper. In addition, the lead-time to procure certain pieces of equipment, such as generators, is substantial. Any delays in procuring the necessary pieces of equipment for the construction of our IBX data centers could delay the anticipated openings of these new IBX data centers and, as a result, increase the cost of these projects.We do not currently employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to address commodity price risk other than the power contracts discussed above.",2023-12-30 20:28:35.924983

All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist readers in understanding our financial information from our management’s perspective and is presented as follows:•Overview•Results of Operations•Non-GAAP Financial Measures•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements•Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates•Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn February 2018, as more fully described in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we entered into an agreement to acquire the Infomart Dallas, including its operations and tenants, from ASB Real Estate Investments. At the closing, we will deliver $31.0 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments, and will issue $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior unsecured notes. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2018, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions. We will account for this transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. In December 2017, as more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we entered into a transaction agreement to acquire the Metronode group of companies, for a cash purchase price of A$1.035 billion, or approximately $791.2 million at the exchange rate in effect on December 15, 2017. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2018. We will account for this transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. In December 2017, as more fully described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we issued €1,000.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior notes due February 1, 2026 (the ""2026 Euro Senior Notes""), or approximately $1,179.0 million in U.S. dollars, at the exchange rate in effect on December 12, 2017, and recorded debt issuance costs of $15.7 million. We also entered into a credit agreement in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $3,000.0 million (""Senior Credit Facility""), comprised of a $2,000.0 million senior unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility (""Revolving Facility"") and an approximately $1,000.0 million senior unsecured multi-currency term loan facility, with maturity date of December 12, 2022 (""Term Loan Facility""). We borrowed £500.0 million and SEK 2,800.0 million under the term loan facility on December 12, 2017, or approximately $997.1 million at the exchange rate in effect on that date. With the proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Euro Senior Notes and borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and cash on hand, we terminated and prepaid in full the amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facility we entered in 2014 (the ""2014 Senior Credit Facility""). As a result, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $22.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2017.In October 2017, as more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we acquired Itconic, with 5 data centers in Spain and Portugal, for a cash purchase price of approximately €220.5 million, or $259.1 million at the exchange rate in effect on October 9, 2017 (the ""Itconic Acquisition""). The Itconic Acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method. The valuation and purchase accounting of this acquisition have not yet been finalized as of December 31, 2017.41Table of ContentsIn October 2017, as more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we acquired the Zenium data center business in Istanbul for a cash purchase price of approximately $92.0 million. The acquired data center will be renamed as the Istanbul 2 (or ""IS2"") data center. The acquisition of the Zenium data center will be accounted for using the acquisition method. The valuation and purchase accounting of this acquisition have not yet been finalized as of December 31, 2017.In September 2017, as more fully described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we issued €1,000.0 million, or approximately $1,199.7 million in U.S. dollars, at the exchange rate in effect on September 20, 2017, in aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior notes due October 1, 2025 (the ""2025 Euro Senior Notes"") and recorded debt issuance costs of $16.3 million. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2025 Euro Senior Notes to redeem our 4.875% senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million in September 2017. As a result, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $14.6 million during the third quarter of 2017.In August 2017, as more fully described in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we launched the ATM program, under which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $750.0 million from time to time through our sales agents. Through December 31, 2017, we have sold 763,201 shares of common stock under the ATM program for net proceeds of approximately $355.1 million. In August 2017, as more fully described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we entered into a fourth amendment (the ""Fourth Amendment"") to our then existing 2014 Senior Credit Facility, where we modified various terms of interest rates applicable to loans borrowed under the Term Loan B Facility and Term B-2 Loan. We terminated and prepaid in full the amounts outstanding under our 2014 Senior Credit Facility in December 2017. In May 2017, as more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed the acquisition of certain colocation business from Verizon consisting of 29 data center buildings located in the United States, Brazil and Colombia, for a cash purchase price of approximately $3.6 billion, which we funded with proceeds of debt and equity financings conducted in January and March 2017 as discussed below. The Verizon Data Center Acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are currently being appraised by a third-party and have not yet been finalized as of December 31, 2017.In March 2017, as more fully described in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we issued and sold 6,069,444 shares of our common stock in a public offering. We received net proceeds of approximately $2,126.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.In March 2017, as more fully described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we issued $1,250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due May 15, 2027 (the ""2027 Senior Notes"") and recorded debt issuance costs of $16.8 million.In February 2017, as more fully described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we acquired IO UK's data center operating business for a cash payment of approximately $36.3 million. The acquired facility was renamed as the London 10 (""LD10"") data center. The IO Acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method. As of December 31, 2017, we have finalized the allocation of purchase price for the IO Acquisition from the provisional amounts reported as of March 31, 2017.In January 2017, as more fully described in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we borrowed the full amount of the Term B-2 Loan of €1,000.0 million, or approximately $1,059.8 million in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on January 6, 2017. We prepaid in full the amounts outstanding under our Term B-2 Loan in December 2017. Overview Equinix provides global data center offerings that protect and connect the world’s most valued information assets. Global enterprises, financial services companies and content and network service providers rely upon Equinix's leading insight and data centers around the world for the safehousing of their critical IT equipment and the ability to directly connect to the networks that enable today's information-driven economy. The Verizon Data Center Acquisition, along with the acquisitions of Itconic, LD10 and IS2, expanded the Company's total global footprint to 190 IBX data centers across 48 markets around the world. Equinix offers the following solutions: (i) premium data center colocation, (ii) interconnection and (iii) exchange and outsourced IT infrastructure solutions. As of December 31, 2017, we operated or had partner IBX data centers in Brazil, Canada, Colombia and throughout the U.S. in the Americas region; Bulgaria, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, 42Table of ContentsSwitzerland, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom in the EMEA region; and Australia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan and Singapore in the Asia-Pacific region. Our data centers in 48 markets around the world are a global platform, which allows our customers to increase information and application delivery performance while significantly reducing costs. This global platform and the quality of our IBX data centers have enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. As more customers choose our IBX data centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate with us as well, in order to gain the full economic and performance benefits of our offerings. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a ""marketplace"" for their services. Our global platform enables scalable, reliable and cost-effective colocation, interconnection and traffic exchange that lowers overall cost and increases flexibility. Our focused business model is built on our critical mass of customers and the resulting ""marketplace"" effect. This global platform, combined with our strong financial position, continues to drive new customer growth and bookings.Historically, our market has been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled telecommunications products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include cloud computing/utility providers, application hosting providers and systems integrators, managed infrastructure hosting providers and colocation providers. More than 350 companies provide data center solutions in the U.S. alone. Each of these data center solutions providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings and outsourced IT infrastructure solutions. We are able to offer our customers a global platform that reaches 24 countries with proven operational reliability, improved application performance, network choice and a highly scalable set of offerings.Our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus net sellable cabinet space available, taking into account power limitations. Our utilization rates were approximately 80%, excluding the Verizon Data Center, Paris IBX Data Center, Itconic, Zenium data center and IO acquisitions, as of December 31, 2017, and 81%, excluding the acquisitions of Telecity Group and Bit-isle, as of December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of IBX data center expansion projects that have opened during the last 12 months and acquisitions mentioned above, our utilization rate would have increased to approximately 82% as of December 31, 2017. Our utilization rate varies from market to market among our IBX data centers across the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain high power-demand customers. This increased power consumption has driven us to build out our new IBX data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX data centers. We could face power limitations in our IBX data centers, even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific IBX data center. This could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given IBX data center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows. Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and offerings. As was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors, such as demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to break even on a free cash flow basis and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. Depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to Equinix standards. Property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant.Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related interconnection and managed infrastructure offerings. We consider these offerings recurring because our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. In addition, during any given quarter of the past three years, more than half of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 3% of our recurring revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Our 50 largest customers accounted for approximately 37%, 36% and 34%, respectively, of our recurring revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer’s initial deployment and professional services that we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring because they are billed typically once, 43Table of Contentsupon completion of the installation or the professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. However, revenues from installation services are deferred and recognized ratably over the period the customer is expected to benefit from the installation. Additionally, revenue from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is generally recognized as the termination occurs, when no remaining related performance obligations exist and the customer is deemed to be creditworthy, to the extent that the revenue has not previously been recognized. As a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future. The largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX data centers, utility costs, including electricity, bandwidth access, IBX data center employees’ salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment and security services. A majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing IBX data centers or open or acquire new IBX data centers. However, there are certain costs that are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. We expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will generally increase in the future on a per-unit or fixed basis, in addition to the variable increase related to the growth in consumption by our customers. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months, as compared to other times of the year. To the extent we incur increased utility costs, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, to the extent we incur increased electricity costs as a result of either climate change policies or the physical effects of climate change, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, sales commissions, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer relationship intangible assets.General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees, and other general corporate expenses, such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and some depreciation expense.We expect our cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses to grow in absolute dollars in connection with our business growth. We may periodically see a higher cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue when a large expansion project opens or is acquired, before it starts generating any meaningful revenue. Furthermore, in relation to cost of revenues, we note that the Americas region has a lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue than either EMEA or Asia-Pacific. This is due to both the increased scale and maturity of the Americas region, compared to either the EMEA or Asia-Pacific region, as well as a higher cost structure outside of the Americas, particularly in EMEA. While we expect all three regions to continue to see lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in future periods, we expect the trend that sees the Americas having the lowest cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to continue. As a result, to the extent that revenue growth outside the Americas grows in greater proportion than revenue growth in the Americas, our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may increase in future periods. Sales and marketing expenses may periodically increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to scale our operations by investing in sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue, including the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovations. General and administrative expenses may also periodically increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth.Taxation as a REIT We elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 taxable year. As of December 31, 2017, our REIT structure included all of our data center operations in the U.S., Canada and Japan, and the data center operations in Europe with the exception of Bulgaria, Portugal, Spain and Turkey. Our data center operations in other jurisdictions are operated as taxable REIT subsidiaries.As a REIT, we generally are permitted to deduct from our federal taxable income the dividends we pay to our stockholders (including, for this purpose, the value of any deemed distributions attributable to anti-dilution adjustments made with respect to our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes prior to their maturity in 2016). The income represented by such dividends is not subject to federal income tax at the entity level but is taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. Nevertheless, the income of our TRSs which hold our U.S. operations that may not be REIT compliant is subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income tax. Likewise, our foreign subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through TRSs or through QRSs. We are also subject to a separate corporate income tax on any gain recognized from a sale of a REIT asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a C corporation (such as (i) an asset that we held as of the effective date of our REIT election, that is, January 1, 2015, or (ii) an asset held by us or a QRS following the liquidation or other conversion of a former 44Table of ContentsTRS). This built-in-gains tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a REIT asset (e.g., January 1, 2015 in the case of REIT assets we held at the time of our REIT conversion), to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a REIT asset. If we fail to remain qualified for federal income tax as a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate tax rates. Even if we remain qualified for federal income tax as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our TRSs’ operations. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the federal income tax regime for REITs, many states do not completely follow federal rules and some may not follow them at all.On March 22, June 21, September 20, and December 13, 2017, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $2.00 per share. We expected these quarterly and other applicable distributions to equal or exceed the taxable income that we recognized in 2017.On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""TCJA"") which contains many significant changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws. The TCJA retains the REIT regime, but contains many significant changes which impact REIT, particularly those with global operations. We are still analyzing the new tax legislation and assessing its impact. Based on our current assessment, which is subject to further interpretation and guidance on the new tax legislation, we believe we can continue to meet all the REIT compliance requirements in the foreseeable future. We continue to monitor our REIT compliance in order to maintain our qualification for federal income tax as a REIT. For this and other reasons, as necessary, we may convert some of our data center operations in other countries into the REIT structure in future periods.Results of OperationsOur results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 include the results of operations of the IO Acquisition from February 3, 2017, the Verizon Data Center Acquisition from May 1, 2017, the Zenium data center acquisition from October 6, 2017 and the Itconic Acquisition from October 9, 2017. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 include the results of operations of TelecityGroup from January 15, 2016 and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition from August 1, 2016. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 include the results of operations of the Nimbo and Bit-isle acquisitions from January 15, 2015 and November 2, 2015, respectively. Discontinued OperationsWe present the results of operations associated with the TelecityGroup data centers that were divested in July 2016 as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. We did not have any discontinued operations activity during 2017 or 2015.45Table of ContentsYears ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2017 % 2016 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas: Recurring revenues$2,062,352 47% $1,593,084 44% 29% 29%Non-recurring revenues110,408 3% 86,465 3% 28% 27% 2,172,760 50% 1,679,549 47% 29% 29%EMEA: Recurring revenues1,266,971 29% 1,106,652 31% 14% 15%Non-recurring revenues79,285 2% 64,687 1% 23% 23% 1,346,256 31% 1,171,339 32% 15% 15%Asia-Pacific: Recurring revenues790,797 18% 717,638 20% 10% 11%Non-recurring revenues58,615 1% 43,463 1% 35% 36% 849,412 19% 761,101 21% 12% 12%Total: Recurring revenues4,120,120 94% 3,417,374 95% 21% 21%Non-recurring revenues248,308 6% 194,615 5% 28% 28% $4,368,428 100% $3,611,989 100% 21% 21%Americas Revenues. Revenues for our Americas region for the year ended December 31, 2017 included approximately $359.1 million of revenues attributable to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our revenues from the United States, the largest revenue contributor in the Americas region for the periods, represented approximately 91% and 92%, respectively, of the regional revenues. Excluding revenues attributable to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to (i) $34.5 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Dallas, New York, Sao Paulo, Silicon Valley, Toronto and Washington, D.C. areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real than during the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting in approximately $11.4 million of favorable foreign currency impact on our Americas revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to 2016 using average exchange rates. EMEA Revenues. As compared to 2016, revenues for our EMEA region for the year ended December 31, 2017 include $47.2 million of incremental revenues from recently closed acquisitions including the TelecityGroup Acquisition, which closed on January 15, 2016, the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, which closed in August 2016, the IO Acquisition, which closed in February 2017, and the Itconic and Zenium data center acquisitions, which closed in October 2017. Our revenues from the U.K., our largest revenue contributor in the EMEA region, represented 30% of regional revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 32% of regional revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the acquisitions, our EMEA revenue growth was primarily due to (i) approximately $62.3 million of revenue from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Amsterdam, Dubai, Dublin, Frankfurt, Helsinki, London, Paris and Zurich metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.9 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA revenues primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Asia-Pacific Revenues. Our revenues from Japan, the largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, represented approximately 34% and 35%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Our Asia-Pacific revenue growth was primarily due to (i) approximately $42.6 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data center expansions in the Hong Kong, Osaka and Sydney metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the Japanese Yen 46Table of Contentsthan during the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting in approximately $6.8 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to 2016 using average exchange rates. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2017 % 2016 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$958,845 44% $700,544 38% 37% 36%EMEA749,933 34% 653,766 36% 15% 15%Asia-Pacific484,371 22% 466,560 26% 4% 5%Total$2,193,149 100% $1,820,870 100% 20% 20% Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues: Americas 44% 42%EMEA 56% 56%Asia-Pacific 57% 61%Total 50% 50%Americas Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues for our Americas region for the year ended December 31, 2017 included approximately $177.4 million of costs of revenues attributable to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition. Excluding the impact from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, depreciation expense was $273.0 million and $241.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX expansion activity. In addition to the increase in depreciation expense, the increase in our Americas cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to (i) $30.4 million of higher utilities, repairs and maintenance, property taxes, and other cost of sales in support of our business growth, and (ii) $13.2 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation (1,114 Americas cost of revenues employees, excluding the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, as of December 31, 2017 versus 1,023 as of December 31, 2016). During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $7.7 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Americas cost of revenues primarily due to a generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. We expect Americas cost of revenues to increase as we continue to expand our business, including results from the newly acquired business from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition.EMEA Cost of Revenues. As compared to 2016, cost of revenues for our EMEA region for the year ended December 31, 2017 included $36.7 million of incremental cost of revenues attributable to recently closed acquisitions, including the TelecityGroup Acquisition that closed on January 15, 2016, the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition that closed in August 2016, the IO Acquisition, which closed in February 2017, and the Itconic and Zenium data center acquisitions, which closed in October 2017. Excluding cost of revenues attributable to these acquisitions, the increase in our EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $25.5 million of higher utilities in support of our business growth, (ii) $16.4 million of higher other cost of sales, including third party and managed service expenses, (iii) $10.7 million of higher depreciation expense and (iv) $7.2 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation (743 EMEA cost of revenues employees, excluding TelecityGroup employees, as of December 31, 2017 versus 623 as of December 31, 2016). During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $2.7 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA cost of revenues, primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. We expect EMEA cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business and as a result of our acquisitions.Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. The increase in our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $16.7 million of higher utilities, rent, facility costs, consulting, bandwidth cost, custom service orders and repairs and maintenance costs in support of our business growth and (ii) $3.3 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (828 Asia-Pacific cost of revenues employees as of December 31, 2017 versus 787 as of December 31, 2016), partially offset by a decrease of $3.2 million in depreciation and accretion expenses. During the year ended 47Table of ContentsDecember 31, 2017, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the Japanese Yen than during the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting in approximately $5.0 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues in 2017. We expect Asia-Pacific cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business.Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % Change 2017 % 2016 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$349,666 60% $230,900 53% 51% 51%EMEA153,811 26% 137,887 31% 12% 14%Asia-Pacific78,247 14% 69,955 16% 12% 13%Total$581,724 100% $438,742 100% 33% 33% Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues: Americas16% 14%EMEA11% 12%Asia-Pacific9% 9%Total13% 12%Americas Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our Americas sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to (i) $75.3 million of amortization of the acquired intangible assets in connection with the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, (ii) $33.1 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (608 Americas sales and marketing employees, including those from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, as December 31, 2017, versus 553 as of December 31, 2016) and (ii) $4.1 million of higher consulting expenses to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Americas sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2016. We anticipate that we will continue to invest in Americas sales and marketing initiatives and expect our Americas sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as we continue to grow our business, including the impact from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition.EMEA Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in the EMEA sales and marketing expense was primarily due to (i) $12.3 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (378 EMEA sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2017 versus 349 as of December 31, 2016) and (ii) an increase of $1.8 million in depreciation and amortization expense, primarily due to acquisitions made during the current year. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $2.8 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA sales and marketing expenses primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our EMEA sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in the Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expense is primarily due to (i) $6.5 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and a larger average headcount in 2017 as compared to 2016 and (ii) $3.2 million of higher rent expense in support of our growth. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2016. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue. These investments have included the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovation efforts. 48Table of ContentsGeneral and Administrative Expenses.

The increase in our Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $35.5 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and headcount growth (1,207 Americas general and administrative employees, including those from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, as of December 31, 2017 versus 934 as of December 31, 2016), (ii) $22.9 million of higher depreciation expense associated with certain systems, including revenue, data management and cloud exchange systems, to improve our quote to order and billing processes and to support the integration and growth of our business and (iii) $16.6 million of higher office expense and consulting cost to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Americas general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2016. Over the course of the past year, we have been investing in our Americas general and administrative functions to scale this region effectively for growth, which has included additional investments in improving our back office systems. We expect our current efforts to improve our back office systems will continue over the next several years. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect Americas general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to further scale our operations to support our growth, including these investments in our back office systems and investments to maintain our REIT qualification. We also expect our Americas general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to grow our business and as a result of the Verizon Data Center Acquisition.EMEA General and Administrative Expenses. The decrease in our EMEA general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $20.8 million of lower amortization expenses as a result of fully amortizing the TelecityGroup trade names during the current period and (ii) $8.4 million of lower consulting expenses which was largely due to the completion of TelecityGroup integration activities in the current period. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $5.7 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA general and administrative expenses primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Over the course of the past year, we have been investing in our EMEA general and administrative functions as a result of our ongoing efforts to scale this region effectively for growth. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect our EMEA general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth.Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expense was primarily due to $5.0 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (453 Asia-Pacific general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2017 versus 358 as of December 31, 2016), partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in rent, repair and maintenance expense. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2016. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to support our growth.Acquisition Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $38.6 million primarily in the Americas and EMEA regions, of which $28.5 million was related to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition during the year 49Table of Contentsended December 31, 2017 attributable to the Americas region. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $64.2 million primarily in the EMEA region due to the acquisitions of Telecity and the Paris IBX Data Center, and to a lesser degree, to the Americas region.Impairment Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded impairment charges totaling $7.7 million in the Asia-Pacific region relating to assets held for sale. We did not have impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2017.Gain on Asset Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a gain on asset sales of $32.8 million primarily relating to the sale of the LD2 data center in the EMEA region and a parcel of land in San Jose in the Americas region. We did not have any gain on asset sales during the year ended December 31, 2017.Income from Operations. Our income from operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2017 % 2016 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$363,220 45% $352,180 57% 3% 3%EMEA237,854 29% 124,853 20% 91% 85%Asia-Pacific207,940 26% 141,706 23% 47% 47%Total$809,014 100% $618,739 100% 31% 30%Americas Income from Continuing Operations. Our Americas income from continuing operations did not change significantly year over year. While revenues increased as described above, this was largely offset by (i) an increase of $18.6 million in acquisition costs, which was primarily related to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, (ii) additional amortization of the acquired intangible assets resulted from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition and (iii) higher cost of revenues and sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Americas income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was not significant when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. EMEA Income from Continuing Operations. The increase in our EMEA income from continuing operations was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and acquisitions, as described above, as well as lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, lower amortization costs as a result of fully amortizing the TelecityGroup trade names during the current period and lower acquisition costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2017. We incurred $9.2 million of acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $54.5 million of acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2016, which was primarily related to our acquisition of TelecityGroup. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $6.4 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA income from continuing operations primarily due to a generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.Asia-Pacific Income from Continuing Operations. The increase in our Asia-Pacific income from continuing operations was primarily due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above and lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest Income. Interest income was $13.1 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in interest income was driven by higher cash balances and interest yield rates for the year ended December 31, 2017. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 0.64% versus 0.37% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $478.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $392.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to the Term B-2 Loan borrowings of €1.0 billion and the issuance of $1.25 billion of 2027 Senior Notes in March 2017, as well as additional financings such as various capital lease and other financing obligations to support our expansion projects. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we capitalized $22.6 million and $13.3 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. We expect to incur higher interest expense going forward in connection with the additional indebtedness that we incurred during 2017.50Table of ContentsOther Income (Expense). We recorded net other income of $9.2 million and net expense of $57.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains and losses during the periods, including $63.5 million in foreign currency losses recognized in the first quarter of 2016 as a result of completing the acquisition of TelecityGroup.Loss on Debt Extinguishment. We recorded $65.8 million net loss on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2017 comprised of (i) $14.6 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the early redemption of the 4.875% Senior Notes due 2020, (ii) $13.2 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the early redemption of the Term B-2 Loan, (iii) $9.3 million of loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the redemption of the Term B Loans, (iv) $16.7 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of amendments to leases and other financing obligations related to built-to-suite arrangements and (v) $12.0 million of loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the settlement of financing obligations of properties purchased. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $12.3 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the settlement of the financing obligations for our Paris 3 IBX data center, a portion of the lender fees associated with the Japanese Yen Term Loan, and the prepayment and termination of our 2012 and 2013 Brazil financings. Income Taxes. We operate as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income distributed to stockholders. We intend to distribute or have distributed the entire taxable income generated by the operations of our REIT and QRSs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. As such, other than built-in-gains recognized and withholding taxes, no provision for U.S. income taxes for the REIT and QRSs has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We have made TRS elections for some of our subsidiaries in and outside the U.S. In general, a TRS may provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs to provide and may hold assets that REITs cannot hold directly. U.S. income taxes for the TRS entities located in the U.S. and foreign income taxes for our foreign operations regardless of whether the foreign operations are operated as QRSs or TRSs have been accrued, as necessary, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded $53.9 million and $45.5 million of income tax expenses, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 18.8% and 28.4%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily due to recognition of unrecognized tax benefits related to our tax positions in the U.S. and Brazil as a result of a lapse in statutes of limitations and lower amount of non-deductible expenses within our EMEA operations. This is partially offset by net deferred tax asset remeasurement in the U.S. TRS due to the corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 as a result of the TCJA. Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a key factor in how we assess the operating performance of our segments and develop regional growth strategies such as IBX data center expansion decisions. We define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs and gain on asset sales. See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below for more information about adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to income or loss from operations.

The increase in our Americas adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above. During the year ended December 31, 2017, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.5 million of net favorable foreign currency impact on our Americas adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the U.S. dollar being generally weaker relative to the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.EMEA Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our EMEA adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $2.1 million of net favorable 51Table of Contentsforeign currency impact to our EMEA adjusted EBITDA primarily due to a generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.Asia-Pacific Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth, as described above, and lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the Japanese Yen than during the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting in approximately $2.7 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2016. Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 Revenues.

Growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to (i) $28.9 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real than during the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in approximately $6.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Americas revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2015. EMEA Revenues. Revenues for our EMEA region for the year ended December 31, 2016 include $404.1 million of revenues attributable to TelecityGroup, which closed in January 2016, and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, which closed in August 2016. After our acquisition of TelecityGroup, the U.K. continues to be our largest revenue contributor in the EMEA region, providing 32% of regional revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 37% of regional revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our EMEA revenue growth was primarily due to (i) $404.1 million of revenues attributable to TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, (ii) approximately $49.7 million of revenue from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Paris and Zurich metro areas and (iii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $33.5 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA revenues 52Table of Contentsprimarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Asia-Pacific Revenues. Revenues for our Asia-Pacific region for the year ended December 31, 2016 include $148.7 million of revenues attributable to Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015. After our acquisition of Bit-isle, Japan is our largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, providing 35% of regional revenues including Bit-isle for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 20% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding revenues attributable to Bit-isle, our revenues from Singapore, which was our largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region before we acquired Bit-isle, represented approximately 38% and 39%, respectively, of the regional revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Our Asia-Pacific revenue growth was primarily due to (i) $148.7 million of revenues attributable to Bit-isle, (ii) approximately $58.2 million of revenue generated from our recently-opened IBX data center expansions in the Hong Kong, Melbourne, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo metro areas and (iii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Japanese Yen than during the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in approximately $7.5 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2015. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2016 % 2015 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$700,544 38% $637,604 49% 10% 11%EMEA653,766 36% 350,270 27% 87% 91%Asia-Pacific466,560 26% 303,632 24% 54% 52%Total$1,820,870 100% $1,291,506 100% 41% 42% Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues: Americas42% 42%EMEA56% 50%Asia-Pacific61% 59%Total50% 47%Americas Cost of Revenues. Our Americas cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 included $241.6 million and $219.1 million, respectively, of depreciation expense. The growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX expansion activity. In addition to the increase in depreciation expense, the increase in our Americas cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to (i) $22.9 million of higher utilities, rent and facilities costs, office expense, consulting, and repairs and maintenance in support of our business growth, (ii) $10.1 million of higher costs primarily due to custom service orders in support of our revenue growth and (iii) $4.5 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.9 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our Americas cost of revenues primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.EMEA Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues for our EMEA region for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $273.5 million of cost of revenues attributable to TelecityGroup, which closed in January 2016, and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, which closed in August 2016. Excluding cost of revenues attributable to TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, EMEA cost of revenues was $380.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $350.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Depreciation expense, excluding TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, was $100.8 million and $97.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX data center expansion activity. Excluding the impact of TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, the remaining increase in our EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $16.4 million of higher utilities, 53Table of Contentsconsulting, and repairs and maintenance costs in support of our business growth, (ii) $4.7 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (623 EMEA cost of revenues employees, excluding TelecityGroup employees, as of December 31, 2016 versus 541 as of December 31, 2015), (iii) $8.3 million of other costs primarily related to the impact from cash flow hedges, offset by $4.0 million of lower rent and facilities costs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $13.6 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA cost of revenues, primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues for our Asia-Pacific region included $116.0 million and $17.4 million of cost of revenues attributable to Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding cost of revenues attributable to Bit-isle, Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was $350.6 million for Asia-Pacific for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $286.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Depreciation expense, excluding Bit-isle, was $149.5 million and $116.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX data center expansion activity. Excluding the impact of our acquisition of Bit-isle, the remaining increase in our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $26.0 million of higher utilities, rent, facility costs, consulting, custom service orders, repairs and maintenance costs in support of our business growth and (ii) $4.5 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (431 Asia-Pacific cost of revenues employees as of December 31, 2016 versus 390 as of December 31, 2015, excluding Bit-isle employees in both periods). During the year ended December 31, 2016, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Japanese Yen than during the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in approximately $5.6 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2015. Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2016 % 2015 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$230,900 53% $208,310 63% 11% 11%EMEA137,887 31% 71,871 22% 92% 98%Asia-Pacific69,955 16% 51,831 15% 35% 34%Total$438,742 100% $332,012 100% 32% 34% Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues: Americas14% 14%EMEA12% 10%Asia-Pacific9% 10%Total12% 12%Americas Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our Americas sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to (i) $16.4 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (553 Americas sales and marketing employees as December 31, 2016 versus 497 as of December 31, 2015) and (ii) $7.9 million of higher advertising, promotion, consulting and travel expenses to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Americas sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2015.EMEA Sales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses for our EMEA region for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $53.0 million attributable to TelecityGroup, which closed in January 2016. Excluding the impact of TelecityGroup, our EMEA sales and marketing expenses were $84.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $71.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to (i) $6.5 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (283 EMEA sales and marketing employees, excluding TelecityGroup employees, as of December 31, 2016 versus 227 as of December 31, 2015), and (ii) $4.0 million of higher advertising, promotion, consulting, and other marketing expenses to support our growth. During the year ended 54Table of ContentsDecember 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.8 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA sales and marketing expenses primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. Sales and marketing expenses for our Asia-Pacific region included $15.6 million and $2.2 million of sales and marketing expenses attributable to Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding the impact of Bit-isle, our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses were $54.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to $4.9 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (205 Asia-Pacific sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2016 versus 183 as of December 31, 2015, excluding Bit-isle employees in both periods). For the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2015. General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2016 % 2015 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$391,637 56% $347,421 70% 13% 13%EMEA228,310 33% 92,803 19% 146% 157%Asia-Pacific74,614 11% 53,060 11% 41% 40%Total$694,561 100% $493,284 100% 41% 43% Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015General and Administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues: Americas23% 23%EMEA19% 13%Asia-Pacific10% 10%Total19% 18%Americas General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $17.5 million of higher depreciation expense associated with certain systems to improve our quote to order and billing processes and other systems to support the integration and growth of our business, (ii) $16.0 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and headcount growth (934 Americas general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2016 versus 800 as of December 31, 2015) and (iii) $10.7 million of higher office expense, rent and facility cost and outside services consulting costs also in line with our overall growth. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Americas general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2015. EMEA General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for our EMEA region for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $92.7 million attributable to TelecityGroup, which closed in January 2016, and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, which closed in August 2016. Excluding the impact of TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, our EMEA general and administrative expenses were $135.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $92.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the impact of TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, the increase was primarily due to (i) $22.8 million of higher consulting services, travel, office and rent and facility costs to support the integration of TelecityGroup and (ii) $18.0 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (562 EMEA general and administrative employees, excluding TelecityGroup employees, as of December 31, 2016 versus 420 as of December 31, 2015). During the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $10.1 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA general and administrative expenses primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in EMEA general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to an increase in amortization expense of $43.9 million associated with the TelecityGroup acquired intangibles. 55Table of ContentsAsia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for our Asia-Pacific region included $17.4 million and $5.8 million of general and administrative expenses attributable to Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding the impact of Bit-isle, our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses were $57.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the impact of Bit-isle, the increase was primarily due to $8.5 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (317 Asia-Pacific general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2016 versus 266 as of December 31, 2015, excluding Bit-isle employees in both periods). For the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2015. Acquisition Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $64.2 million primarily attributed to the EMEA region due to the acquisitions of Telecity and the Paris IBX Data Center. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $41.7 million primarily attributed to the EMEA region, and to a lesser degree, to the Asia-Pacific region.Impairment Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded impairment charges totaling $7.7 million in the Asia-Pacific region relating to assets held for sale. We did not have impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2015.Gain on Asset Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a gain on asset sales of $32.8 million primarily relating to the sale of the LD2 data center in the EMEA region and a parcel of land in San Jose in the Americas region. We did not have any gain on asset sales during the year ended December 31, 2015.Income from Operations. Our income from operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2016 % 2015 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$352,180 57% $324,458 57% 9% 9%EMEA124,853 20% 145,527 26% (14)% (11)%Asia-Pacific141,706 23% 97,357 17% 46% 44%Total$618,739 100% $567,342 100% 9% 10%Americas Income from Continuing Operations. The increase in our Americas income from continuing operations was due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above as well as the gain recognized on the sale of the San Jose land parcel, partially offset by higher cost of revenues and operating expenses primarily attributable to higher compensation and other headcount related expenses to support our growth. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Americas income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2015. EMEA Income from Continuing Operations. The decrease in our EMEA income from continuing operations was primarily due to acquisition and integration costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of TelecityGroup, which closed in January 2016, as well as the increased depreciation and amortization created from the purchase accounting for TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, partially offset by the gain recognized on the sale of the LD2 data center. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $5.2 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA income from continuing operations primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.Asia-Pacific Income from Continuing Operations. The increase in our Asia-Pacific income from continuing operations was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our acquisition and integration of Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015, as well as our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above, partially offset by the impairment charges, higher cost of revenues and operating expenses primarily attributable to our acquisition of Bit-isle as well as higher compensation and other headcount related expenses and higher professional fees to support our growth. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2015. 56Table of ContentsInterest Income. Interest income was $3.5 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 0.37% versus 0.38% for the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $392.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $299.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase in interest expense was primarily due to the impact of our $1.1 billion of senior notes issued in December 2015, $614.7 million outstanding in seven-year term loans we borrowed in January 2016 and $406.6 million outstanding in five-year term loans we borrowed in October 2016, replacing a bridge term loan facility we borrowed to finance our acquisition of Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015, as well as additional financings such as various capital lease and other financing obligations to support our expansion projects. The increase in interest expense is partially offset by the settlement of the 4.75% convertible debt in June 2016. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we capitalized $13.3 million and $10.9 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. Going forward, we expect to incur higher interest expense as we borrowed the €1.0 billion Term B-2 Loan in January 2017. We also expect to incur additional indebtedness to support our growth and acquisition opportunities including the Verizon Asset Purchase, resulting in higher interest expense going forward. Other Income (Expense). We recorded net other expense of $57.9 million and $60.6 million for the years December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses during the periods.Loss on Debt Extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $12.3 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the settlement of the financing obligations for our Paris 3 IBX data center, a portion of the lender fees associated with the Japanese Yen Term Loan, and the prepayment and termination of our 2012 and 2013 Brazil financings. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a $0.3 million loss on debt extinguishment which was attributable to partial conversions of our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes in December 2015.Income Taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded $45.5 million and $23.2 million of income tax expenses, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 28.4% and 11.0%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily due to higher profits in the domestic TRS and larger amount of non-deductible interest expenses within our EMEA operations. We recorded excess income tax benefits of $2.8 million and $30.0 thousand during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheets.Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a key factor in how we assess the operating performance of our segments and develop regional growth strategies such as IBX data center expansion decisions. We define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs and gain on asset sales. See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below for more information about adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to income or loss from operations. Our adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2016 % 2015 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$787,311 47% $698,604 55% 13% 13%EMEA494,263 30% 318,561 25% 55% 59%Asia-Pacific375,900 23% 254,462 20% 48% 46%Total$1,657,474 100% $1,271,627 100% 30% 31%Americas Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our Americas adjusted EBITDA was due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above. During the year ended December 31, 2016, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $2.2 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Americas adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. EMEA Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for our EMEA region includes $189.0 million of adjusted EBITDA attributable to our acquisition of TelecityGroup, which closed in January 2016, and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, which closed in August 2016. Excluding adjusted EBITDA attributable to TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition, the decrease in our EMEA adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher operating costs as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above and integration costs relating to TelecityGroup acquisition. During the year ended 57Table of ContentsDecember 31, 2016, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $10.7 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA adjusted EBITDA primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.Asia-Pacific Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for our Asia-Pacific region includes $50.3 million and $5.2 million of adjusted EBITDA attributable to our acquisition of Bit-isle, which closed in November 2015, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding adjusted EBITDA attributable to Bit-isle, the increase in our Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Japanese Yen than during the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting in approximately $4.1 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2015. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but we believe that evaluating our ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, we use non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operations. Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We have presented such non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and ability to perform in subsequent periods. We believe that if we did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze Equinix effectively. Investors should note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by us may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. Investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing non-GAAP financial measures used by us to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. Our primary non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted funds from operations (""AFFO""), exclude depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of our IBX data centers and do not reflect our current or future cash spending levels to support our business. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of an IBX data center do not recur with respect to such data center, although we may incur initial construction costs in future periods with respect to additional IBX data centers, and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to our initial investment. This is a trend we expect to continue. In addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of our IBX data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs incurred to build out our IBX data centers and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. Therefore, we exclude depreciation from our operating results when evaluating our operations. In addition, in presenting adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, we exclude amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense is significantly affected by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions and these charges may vary in amount from period to period. We exclude amortization expense to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our prior periods. We exclude accretion expense, both as it relates to asset retirement obligations as well as accrued restructuring charge liabilities, as these expenses represent costs which we believe are not meaningful in evaluating our current operations. We exclude stock-based compensation expense, as it can vary significantly from period to period based on share price, the timing, size and nature of equity awards. As such, we, and many investors and analysts, exclude stock-based compensation expense to compare our operating results with those of other companies. We also exclude restructuring charges. The restructuring charges relate to our decisions to exit leases for excess space adjacent to several of our IBX data centers, which we did not intend to build out, or our decision to reverse such restructuring charges. We also exclude impairment charges related to certain long-lived assets. The impairment charges are related to expense recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets are not recoverable. We also exclude gain or loss on asset sales as it represents profit or loss that is not meaningful in evaluating the current or future operating performance. Finally, we exclude acquisition costs from AFFO and adjusted EBITDA to allow more comparable comparisons of our financial results to our historical operations. The acquisition costs relate to costs we incur in connection with business combinations. Such charges generally are not relevant to assessing the long-term performance of the company. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges vary significantly 58Table of Contentsbased on the size and timing of the acquisitions. Management believes items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, gain or loss on asset sales and acquisition costs are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs may occur in future periods.Adjusted EBITDAWe define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs, and gain on asset sales as presented below (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015Income from operations$809,014 $618,739 $567,342Depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense1,028,892 843,510 528,929Stock-based compensation expense175,500 156,148 133,633Acquisition costs38,635 64,195 41,723Impairment charges— 7,698 —Gain on asset sales— (32,816) —Adjusted EBITDA$2,052,041 $1,657,474 $1,271,627Our adjusted EBITDA results have improved each year and in each region in total dollars due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in ""Results of Operations"", as well as the nature of our business model consisting of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature also discussed earlier in ""Overview"".Funds from Operations (""FFO"") and AFFOWe use FFO and AFFO, which are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in the REIT industry. FFO is calculated in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (""NAREIT""). FFO represents net income (loss), excluding gain (loss) from the disposition of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures’ and non-controlling interests’ share of these items. We use AFFO to evaluate our performance on a consolidated basis and as a metric in the determination of employees’ annual bonuses beginning in 2015 and vesting of restricted stock units that were granted beginning in 2015 and that have both service and performance conditions. In presenting AFFO, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future operating performance. AFFO represents FFO excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate assets, accretion, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs, gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and noncontrolling interests’ share of these items and net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax. The adjustments for both installation revenue and straight-line rent expense are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight-lined or amortized results in the consolidated statement of operations. We exclude the amortization of deferred financing costs as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings that have no current or future cash obligations. We exclude gain (loss) on debt extinguishment since it generally represents the write-off of initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings or a cost that is incurred to reduce future interest costs and is not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance. We include an income tax expense adjustment, which represents the non-cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes that do not relate to current period’s operations. We deduct recurring capital expenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of its IBX data centers or other assets that are required to support current revenues. We also exclude net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, which represents results that may not recur and are not a good indicator of our current future operating performance.59Table of ContentsOur FFO and AFFO were as follows (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015Net income$232,982 $126,800 $187,774Adjustments: Real estate depreciation and amortization754,351 626,564 439,969(Gain) loss on disposition of real estate property4,945 (28,388) 1,382Adjustments for FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures85 113 113NAREIT FFO attributable to common stockholders$992,363 $725,089 $629,238 Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015NAREIT FFO attributable to common stockholders$992,363 $725,089 $629,238Adjustments: Installation revenue adjustment24,496 20,161 35,498Straight-line rent expense adjustment8,925 7,700 7,931Amortization of deferred financing costs24,449 18,696 16,135Stock-based compensation expense175,500 156,149 133,633Non-real estate depreciation expense111,121 87,781 58,165Amortization expense177,008 122,862 27,446Accretion expense (adjustment)(13,588) 6,303 3,349Recurring capital expenditures(167,995) (141,819) (120,281)Loss on debt extinguishment65,772 12,276 289Acquisition costs38,635 64,195 41,723Impairment charges— 7,698 —Net income from discontinued operations, net of tax— (12,392) —Income tax expense adjustment371 3,680 (1,270)Adjustments for AFFO from unconsolidated joint ventures(17) (40) (58)AFFO$1,437,040 $1,078,339 $831,798Our AFFO results have improved due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in ""Results of Operations,"" as well as due to the nature of our business model which consists of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature as discussed earlier in ""Overview."" Constant Currency PresentationOur revenues and certain operating expenses (cost of revenues, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses) from our international operations have represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues and certain operating expenses. As a result, our revenues and certain operating expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. dollar against major international currencies such as the Euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar, Australian dollar and Brazilian real. In order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present period-over-period percentage changes in our revenues and certain operating expenses on a constant currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, we have presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results. To present this information, our current and comparative prior period revenues and certain operating expenses from entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2016 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2017 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2017 with the year ended December 31, 2016, and average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 60Table of Contents2015 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2016 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2016 with the year ended December 31, 2015). Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of December 31, 2017, our total indebtedness was comprised of debt and financing obligations totaling approximately $10.2 billion consisting of (a) approximately $7,002.0 million of principal from our senior notes, (b) approximately $1,699.0 million from our capital lease and other financing obligations and (c) $1,468.3 million of principal from our mortgage and other loans payable (gross of debt issuance cost, debt discount, plus debt premium).We believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of the current portion of our debt as it becomes due, payment of regular dividend distributions and completion of our publicly-announced expansion projects. As of December 31, 2017, we had $1,450.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, of which approximately $929.3 million was held in the U.S. In addition to our cash and investment portfolio, we have additional liquidity available to us from our $2,000.0 million Revolving Facility and the ATM program described below. On May 1, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Verizon's colocation data centers and their operations located in the United States, Brazil and Colombia for a cash purchase price of approximately $3,594.7 million. The Verizon Data Center Acquisition was funded by the borrowing of our then existing €1,000.0 million Term B-2 Loan and proceeds from the issuance of our $1,250.0 million 2027 Senior Notes and the issuance of common stock. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we borrowed the full amount of our €1,000.0 million Term B-2 Loan (see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), issued $1,250.0 million of 5.375% senior notes due 2027 (see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and sold 6,069,444 shares of common stock in a public offering for net proceeds of $2,126.3 million (see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). In August 2017, we entered into an equity distribution agreement to sell up to $750.0 million of common stock in at the market (""ATM"") offerings. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold 763,201 shares for approximately $355.1 million, net of payment of commissions to the sales agents and estimated equity offering costs under the ATM program.In September 2017, we issued €1,000.0 million 2025 Euro Senior Notes and redeemed the entire $500.0 million principal amount of our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2020. In December 2017, we issued €1,000.0 million 2026 Euro Senior Notes and entered into a credit agreement with a group of lenders for a $3,000.0 million Senior Credit Facility, comprised of a $2,000.0 million Revolving Facility and approximately a $1,000.0 million Term Loan Facility. We borrowed £500.0 million and SEK 2,800.0 million under the Term Loan Facility on December 12, 2017, or approximately $997.1 million at the exchange rate in effect on that date. Using the proceeds borrowed from the Term Loan Facility and the €1,000.0 million 2026 Euro Senior Notes and cash on hand, we terminated and repaid in full amounts outstanding under the 2014 Senior Credit Facility.As of December 31, 2017, we had 41 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $62.6 million issued and outstanding under the Revolving Facility; as a result of these letters of credit, we had a total of approximately $1,937.4 million of additional liquidity available to us under the Revolving Facility. Besides any further financing activity we may pursue, customer collections are our primary source of cash. While we believe we have a strong customer base, and have continued to experience relatively strong collections, if the current market conditions were to deteriorate, some of our customers may have difficulty paying us and we may experience increased churn in our customer base, including reductions in their commitments to us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Additionally, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build out of new IBX data centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as potential acquisitions. While we expect to fund these plans with our existing resources, additional financing, either debt or equity, may be required, and if current market conditions were to deteriorate, we may be unable to secure additional financing or any such additional financing may only be available to us on unfavorable terms. An inability to pursue additional expansion opportunities will have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our desired level of revenue growth in future periods.We completed our conversion to a REIT in 2014 and began operating as a REIT effective January 1, 2015. As a result of our conversion to a REIT, we made special distributions to our stockholders in 2015 and 2014. The distributions were payable in common stock or cash at the election of our stockholders, with the cash portion of the distributions subject to certain maximum amounts. As a result of the special distributions, we paid a total of $125.5 million in 2015 and $83.3 million in 2014 and distributed 1.7 million and 1.5 million shares of common stock in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Also as a result of our conversion to a REIT, we began paying quarterly dividends in 2015. We paid an aggregate of $621.5 million and $499.5 million of quarterly cash dividends during 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $521.5 million of quarterly cash dividends and special distribution during 2015.61Table of ContentsSources and Uses of Cash Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (in thousands)Net cash provided by operating activities$1,439,233 $1,019,353 $894,823Net cash used in investing activities(5,400,826) (2,045,668) (637,797)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities4,607,860 (897,065) 1,873,152Operating ActivitiesOur cash provided by our operations is generated by colocation, interconnection, managed infrastructure and other revenues. Our primary use of cash from our operating activities include compensation and related costs, interest payments, other general corporate expenditures and taxes. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to improved operating results combined with incremental operating cash provided by the Verizon Data Center Acquisition and other acquisitions in 2017, offset by timing of collections on our receivables and increases in cash paid for cost of revenues, operating expenses, interest expense and income taxes. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to improved operating results combined with incremental operating cash provided by the acquisition of TelecityGroup in January 2016 and inclusion of full year operating results of Bit-isle.Investing ActivitiesThe increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the increase in spending for business acquisitions of approximately of $2,196.7 million, primarily related to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, a decrease in proceeds from asset sales of $803.8 million, $265.4 million of higher capital expenditures and $67.0 million of higher purchases of real estate, primarily as a result of expansion activity. The increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the increase in spending for the acquisitions of TelecityGroup and the Paris IBX Data Center of $1,521.4 million, net of cash acquired, over prior year acquisition spending, a decrease in sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases, of $503.3 million and $245.2 million of higher capital expenditures, primarily a result of expansion activity. This was partially offset by proceeds from sales of assets of $851.6 million, net of cash transferred. During 2018, we expect to complete the acquisitions of Metronode and the Infomart Dallas. We also anticipate our IBX expansion construction activity will increase from our 2017 levels. If the opportunity to expand is greater than planned and we have sufficient funding to pursue such expansion opportunities, we may further increase the level of capital expenditures to support this growth as well as pursue additional business acquisitions, property acquisitions or joint ventures.Financing ActivitiesNet cash provided by financing activities during 2017 was primarily due to (i) borrowings under our €1,000.0 million Term B-2 Loan, approximately $1,059.8 million at the exchange rate in effect on January 6, 2017, (ii) the issuance of $1,250.0 million 2027 Senior Notes, (iii) the issuance of €1,000.0 million 2025 Euro Senior Notes, approximately $1,199.7 million at the exchange rate on September 20, 2017, (iv) the issuance of €1,000.0 million 2026 Euro Senior Notes, approximately $1,179.0 million at the exchange rate on December 12, 2017, (v) borrowings under our Term Loan Facility of approximately $997.1 million on December 12, 2017, at the exchange rate in effect on that day, (vi) the sale of common stock for net proceeds of $2,481.4 million and (vii) proceeds from employee awards of $41.7 million, partially offset by (i) repayment of the entire $500.0 million principal amount of our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2020 (ii) repayment in full of amounts outstanding under the 2014 Senior Credit Facility of approximately $2,207.7 million in total at the exchange rate on December 12, 2017, (iii) dividend distributions of $621.5 million, (iv) repayments of capital lease and other financing obligations of $93.5 million and (v) debt issuance costs of $81.0 million. Net cash used in financing activities during 2016 was primarily due to (i) $1,462.9 million repayment of loans payable including repayment of loans assumed in the TelecityGroup acquisition, bridge term loan and revolving credit facility, (ii) $114.4 million repayment of capital lease and other financing obligations and (iii) $499.5 million payment of dividends, partially offset by (iv) $1,168.3 million of proceeds from loans payable including proceeds from our Term Loan B and Japanese Yen Term Loan. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2015 was primarily due to (i) $1,100.0 million of gross proceeds from the senior notes offering in December 2015, (ii) $829.5 million of net proceeds from our public offering of common stock in November 2015, (iii) $1,197.1 million of proceeds from loans payable including proceeds from our term loan modification, our bridge term loan and our revolving credit facility, partially offset by (iv) $715.3 million repayment of mortgage and loans payable including repayment of $171.2 million of loans assumed in the Bit-isle acquisition and repayment of $544.1 million of U.S. dollar-denominated term loan and other mortgage and loan payments, (v) $396.0 million of quarterly dividend distributions and (vi) $125.5 million of special distributions. Going forward, we expect that our financing activities will consist primarily of repayment and refinancing 62Table of Contentsof our debt and additional financings needed to support expansion opportunities, additional acquisitions or joint ventures, and the payment of our regular cash dividends.Debt ObligationsDebt FacilitiesWe have various debt obligations with maturity dates ranging from 2018 to 2027 under which a total principal balance of $8,470.3 million remained outstanding (gross of debt issuance cost and discounts) as of December 31, 2017. For further information on debt obligations, see ""Debt Facilities"" in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Capital Lease and Other Financing ObligationsWe have numerous capital lease and other financing obligations with maturity dates ranging from 2018 to 2053 under which a total principal balance of $1,699.0 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2017 with a weighted average effective interest rate of 7.86%. For further information on our capital leases and other financing obligations, see ""Capital Lease and Other Financing Obligations"" in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet ArrangementsWe lease a majority of our IBX data centers and certain equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements expiring through 2065.

These letters of credit were provided in lieu of cash deposits. If the landlords for these IBX leases decide to draw down on these letters of credit triggered by an event of default under the lease, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowing under the revolving credit facility. These contingent commitments are not reflected in the table above.We had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaling approximately $57.5 million as of December 31, 2017. These liabilities, which are reflected on our balance sheet, are not reflected in the table above since it is unclear when these liabilities will be paid.Primarily as a result of our various IBX data center expansion projects, as of December 31, 2017, we were contractually committed for $508.2 million of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for IBX equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided in connection with the work necessary to complete construction and open these IBX data centers prior to making them available to customers 63Table of Contentsfor installation. This amount, which is expected to be paid during 2018 and thereafter, is reflected in the table above as ""other contractual commitments.""We had other non-capital purchase commitments in place as of December 31, 2017, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods or services to be delivered or provided during 2018 and beyond. Such other purchase commitments as of December 31, 2017, which total $643.6 million, are also reflected in the table above as ""other contractual commitments.""On October 13, 2017, we entered into an agreement to purchase certain real property in Sydney, Australia, for a purchase price of A$110.0 million or approximately $86.7 million, subject to certain closing conditions, which is not reflected in the table above. We expect to close this transaction in 2018.In December 2017, we entered into a transaction agreement to acquire the Metronode group of companies, for a cash purchase price of A$1.035 billion, or approximately $791.2 million at the exchange rate in effect on December 15, 2017. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2018, subject to certain closing conditions, which is not reflected in the table above. Other Off-Balance-Sheet ArrangementsWe have various guarantor arrangements with both our directors and officers and third parties, including customers, vendors and business partners. As of December 31, 2017, there were no significant liabilities recorded for these arrangements. For additional information, see ""Guarantor Arrangements"" in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require significant judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain:•Accounting for income taxes;•Accounting for business combinations;•Accounting for impairment of goodwill; and•Accounting for property, plant and equipment.64Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Income Taxes.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or settled. The accounting standard for income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined by the accounting standard as a likelihood of more than 50%) that such assets will not be realized.A tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authority’s widely understood administrative practices and precedents.The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future events. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. If, based on the weight of that available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified.This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account a number of types of evidence, including the following: 1) the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, 2) sources of future taxable income and 3) tax planning strategies.In assessing the tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position, the tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had net total deferred tax liabilities of $186.3 million and $212.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a total valuation allowance of $84.6 million and $29.2 million, respectively. If and when we reduce our remaining valuation allowances, it may have a favorable impact to our financial position and results of operations in the periods when such determinations are made. We will continue to assess the need for our valuation allowances, by country or location, in the futureDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we provided full and partial valuation allowances on the Spanish and Turkish deferred tax assets acquired from the Itconic and Zenium data center acquisitions, respectively. In addition, we set up a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset associated with tax goodwill obtained as a result of a reorganization in Brazil. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we decided to release the valuation allowances related to the historical data center operations in Japan. This reduction in valuation allowance was partially offset by the full valuation allowance setups in Brazil and Canada as well as the increase in valuation allowances in Europe due to the TelecityGroup acquisition and integration. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $82.4 million and $72.2 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the unrecognized tax benefits increased by $10.2 million primarily due to the TelecityGroup integrations which was partially offset by the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits related to the Company’s tax positions in the U.S. and Brazil as a result of a lapse in statutes of limitations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the unrecognized tax benefits increased by $41.4 million primarily due to the TelecityGroup acquisition and integration. The unrecognized tax benefits of $82.4 million as of December 31, 2017, if subsequently recognized, will affect our effective tax rate favorably at the time when such benefits are recognized.65Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Business CombinationsIn accordance with the accounting standard for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as customer contracts, leases and any other significant assets or liabilities and contingent consideration, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date if we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires assumptions and management’s judgment to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Key judgment used to estimate the fair value of intangible assets include projected revenue growth and operating margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. During the last three years, we have completed a number of business combinations, including the Itconic Acquisition in October, 2017, Zenium data center acquisition in October, 2017, the Verizon Data Center Acquisition in May, 2017, IO Acquisition in February, 2017, the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition in August 2016, TelecityGroup acquisition in January 2016, Bit-isle acquisition in November 2015, and Nimbo acquisition in January 2015. In 2017, we have finalized the purchase price allocation for the Paris IBX Data Center and IO acquisitions in the first and fourth quarters, respectively. The purchase price allocation for the TelecityGroup and Bit-isle acquisitions were completed in the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had net intangible assets of $2.4 billion, $719.2 million and $224.6 million, respectively. We recorded amortization expense for intangible assets of $177.0 million, $122.9 million and $27.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we used to complete the purchase price allocations and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, which would be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in 2018 or beyond. 66Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsIn accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform goodwill and other intangible assets impairment reviews annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We complete the annual goodwill impairment assessment for the Americas reporting unit, the EMEA reporting unit and the Asia-Pacific reporting unit to determine if the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values. If goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform step two of goodwill impairment test. We perform a review of other intangible assets for impairment by assessing events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In 2017, we elected to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, this analysis requires assumptions and estimates before performing the two-step goodwill impairment test, where the assessment requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. In 2016, we elected to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test, we used both the income and market approach. The income approach is based on the ten-year business plan. We apply the weighted-average cost of capital applicable to our reporting units as discount rates. This requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. The market approach requires judgment in determining the appropriate market comparables. These assumptions require significant management judgment and are inherently subject to uncertainties. In 2017 and 2016, we performed our annual review of other intangible assets by assessing if there were events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, such as a significant decrease in market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset or a continuous deterioration of our financial condition. This assessment requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. There were no specific events in 2016 or 2017 that indicated a significant potential impairment. As of December 31, 2017, goodwill attributable to the Americas reporting unit, the EMEA reporting unit and the Asia-Pacific reporting unit was $1.6 billion, $2.6 billion and $239.4 million, respectively. Future events, changing market conditions and any changes in key assumptions may result in an impairment charge. While we have not recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill to date, the development of adverse business conditions in our Americas, EMEA or Asia-Pacific reporting units, such as higher than anticipated customer churn or significantly increased operating costs, or significant deterioration of our market comparables that we use in the market approach, could result in an impairment charge in future periods. The balance of our other intangible assets, net, for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $2.4 billion. While we have not recorded an impairment charge against our other intangible assets to date, future events or changes in circumstances, such as a significant decrease in market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate, may result in an impairment charge in future periods. Any potential impairment charge against our goodwill and other intangible assets would not exceed the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.67Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Property, Plant and EquipmentWe have a substantial amount of property, plant and equipment recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The vast majority of our property, plant and equipment represent the costs incurred to build out or acquire our IBX data centers. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets. The majority of our IBX data centers are in properties that are leased. We depreciate our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (subject to the term of the lease in the case of leased assets or leasehold improvements and integral equipment located in leased properties). Accounting for property, plant and equipment includes determining the appropriate period in which to depreciate such assets, making assessments for leased properties to determine whether they are capital or operating leases, determining if construction projects performed at leased properties trigger build-to-suit lease accounting, assessing such assets for potential impairment, capitalizing interest during periods of construction and assessing the asset retirement obligations required for certain leased properties that require us to return the leased properties back to their original condition at the time we decide to exit a leased property.While there are numerous judgments and uncertainties involved in accounting for property, plant and equipment that are significant, arriving at the estimated useful life of an asset requires the most critical judgment for us and changes to these estimates would have the most significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. When we lease a property for our IBX data centers, we generally enter into long-term arrangements with initial lease terms of at least 8-10 years and with renewal options generally available to us. During the next several years, a number of leases for our IBX data centers will come up for renewal. As we start approaching the end of these initial lease terms, we will need to reassess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment. In addition, we may find that our estimates for the useful lives of non-leased assets may also need to be revised periodically. We periodically review the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment and changes in these estimates in the future are possible. Another area of judgment for us in connection with our property, plant and equipment is related to lease accounting. Most of our IBX data centers are leased. Each time we enter into a new lease or lease amendment for one of our IBX data centers, we analyze each lease or lease amendment for the proper accounting. This requires certain judgments on our part such as establishing the lease term to include in a lease test, establishing the remaining estimated useful life of the underlying property or equipment and estimating the fair value of the underlying property or equipment, establishing the incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payment for the lease test. All of these judgments are inherently uncertain. Different assumptions or estimates could result in a different accounting treatment for a lease.The assessment of long-lived assets for impairment requires assumptions and estimates of undiscounted and discounted future cash flows. These assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and are inherently uncertain.As of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had property, plant and equipment of $9.4 billion, $7.2 billion, and $5.6 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded depreciation expense of $865.5 million, $714.3 million, and $498.1 million, respectively. While we evaluated the appropriateness, we did not revise the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Further changes in our estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment could have a significant impact on our results of operations.As of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had property, plant and equipment under capital leases and other financing obligations of $1.8 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. We recorded accumulated depreciation for assets under capital leases and other financing obligations of $348.4 million, $283.7 million and $221.8 million as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded rent expense of $157.9 million, $140.6 million, and $101.5 million under operating leases. Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee ""Recent Accounting Pronouncements"" in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.68Table of ContentsITEM 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket Risk The following discussion about market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity.We employ foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging certain specifically-identified exposures. The use of these financial instruments is intended to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, but does not eliminate such risks. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Investment Portfolio RiskWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities that is prioritized on meeting REIT asset requirements. All of our marketable securities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax. We consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge for our securities, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. We anticipate that we will recover the entire cost basis of these securities and have determined that no other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were required to be recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017.As of December 31, 2017, our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market funds, certificates of deposits and publicly traded equity securities. The amount in our investment portfolio that could be susceptible to market risk totaled $464.6 million.Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our outstanding debt. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates from their position as of December 31, 2017 would not have a material impact on our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of the majority of our debt obligations. However, the interest expense associated with our senior credit facility and term loans, which bear interest at variable rates, could be affected. For every 100 basis point change in interest rates, our annual interest expense could increase by a total of approximately $12.6 million or decrease by a total of approximately $3.8 million based on the total balance of our primary borrowings under the Term A loan facility and the Japanese yen term loan as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had not employed any interest rate derivative products against our debt obligations. However, we may enter into interest rate hedging agreements in the future to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk.The fair value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate changes may affect the fair value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair value of our senior notes, which are traded in the market, was based on quoted market prices. The fair value of our mortgage and loans payable, which are not traded in the market, is estimated by considering our credit rating, current rates available to us for debt of the same remaining maturities and the terms of the debt. The following table represents the carrying value and estimated fair value of our mortgage and loans payable and senior notes as of (in thousands): December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Carrying Value (1) Fair Value Carrying Value (1) Fair ValueMortgage and loans payable$1,468,275 $1,464,877 $1,459,826 $1,461,954Senior notes7,002,000 7,288,673 3,850,000 4,033,985___________________(1)The carrying value is gross of debt issuance cost and discount.Foreign Currency Risk A significant portion of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, however, approximately 54.8% of our revenues and 53.8% of our operating costs are attributable to Brazil, Canada and the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions, and a large portion of those revenues and costs are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, British pound, Japanese yen, 69Table of ContentsSingapore dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Australian dollar and Brazilian real. To help manage the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we have implemented a number of hedging programs, in particular (i) a cash flow hedging program to hedge the forecasted revenues and expenses in our EMEA region, (ii) a balance sheet hedging program to hedge the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, and (iii) a net investment hedging program to hedge the long term investments in our foreign subsidiaries. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements and its impact on the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of up to two years.We have entered into various foreign currency loans and senior notes which are designated as hedges against our net investment in foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2017, the total principal amount of foreign currency loans and senior notes was $3,819.4 million, including $2,402.0 million denominated in Euro, $675.9 million denominated in British pound, $341.9 million denominated in Swedish krona and $399.6 million denominated in Japanese Yen. As of December 31, 2017, we have designated $3,149.5 million of the total principal amount of foreign currency loans and senior notes as net investment hedges. For a net investment hedge, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument designated as a net investment hedge, except the ineffective portion and forward points, are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. We did not record any ineffectiveness during 2017. Any remaining change in the carrying value of the foreign currency loans and senior notes is recognized in other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of operations. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between these foreign currencies (i.e. Euro, British pound, Swedish krona and Japanese Yen) and the U.S. Dollar will impact the amount of U.S. Dollars that we will require to settle the foreign currency loans and senior notes at maturity. If the U.S. Dollar would have been weaker or stronger by 10% in comparison to these foreign currencies as of December 31, 2017, we estimate our obligation to cash settle the principal of these foreign currency loans and senior notes in U.S. Dollars would have increased or decreased by approximately $382.0 million respectively. For the foreseeable future, we anticipate that approximately 50% or less of our revenues and operating costs will continue to be generated and incurred outside of the U.S. in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. During fiscal 2017, the U.S. dollar became generally weaker relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate. This overall weakening of the U.S. dollar had a positive impact on our consolidated results of operations because the foreign denominations translated into more U.S. dollars. In future periods, the volatility of the U.S. dollar as compared to the other currencies in which we do business could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations including the amount of revenue that we report in future periods.With the existing cash flow hedges in place, a hypothetical additional 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2017 would have resulted in a reduction of our revenues and operating expenses, including depreciation and amortization expenses, for the year by approximately $132.4 million and $134.4 million, respectively.With the existing cash flow hedges in place, a hypothetical additional 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2017 would have resulted in an increase of our revenues and operating expenses, including depreciation and amortization expenses, for the year by approximately $127.3 million and $136.0 million, respectively.We may enter into additional hedging activities in the future to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency risk as our exposure to foreign currency risk continues to increase due to our growing foreign operations; however, we do not currently intend to eliminate all foreign currency transaction exposure. Commodity Price RiskCertain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of price changes are electricity, supplies and equipment used in our IBX data centers. We closely monitor the cost of electricity at all of our locations. We have entered into several power contracts to purchase power at fixed prices in certain locations in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom.In addition, as we are building new, or expanding existing, IBX data centers, we are subject to commodity price risk for building materials related to the construction of these IBX data centers, such as steel and copper. In addition, the lead-time to procure certain pieces of equipment, such as generators, is substantial. Any delays in procuring the necessary pieces of equipment for the construction of our IBX data centers could delay the anticipated openings of these new IBX data centers and, as a result, increase the cost of these projects.We do not currently employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to address commodity price risk other than the power contracts discussed above.70Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:28:36.569373

As of December 31, 2018, no shares remained available for sale under the 2017 ATM Program. In December 2018, we launched another ATM program, under which we may offer and sell from time to time up to an aggregate of $750.0 million of our common stock in ""at the market"" transactions (the ""2018 ATM Program""). As of December 31, 2018, no sales have been made under the 2018 ATM Program.In July 2018, as more fully described in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we entered into an amendment to our existing credit agreement to add a senior unsecured term loan in an aggregate principal amount of ¥47.5 billion (the ""JPY Term Loan""). Concurrent with the closing of our JPY Term Loan, we drew down the full ¥47.5 billion of the JPY Term Loan, or approximately $424.7 million, and prepaid the remaining principal of our existing Japanese Yen Term Loan of ¥43.8 billion, or approximately $391.3 million. We recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $2.2 million during the third quarter of 2018 in connection therewith. In April 2018, as more fully described in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed the acquisition of Metronode for a cash purchase price of A$1.034 billion or approximately $804.6 million at the exchange rate in effect on April 18, 2018 (the ""Metronode Acquisition""). We accounted for this transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The valuation and purchase accounting of this acquisition have not yet been finalized as of December 31, 2018.In April 2018, as more fully described in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we completed the acquisition of Infomart Dallas for total consideration of approximately $804.0 million (the ""Infomart Dallas Acquisition""), consisting of approximately $45.8 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments, and $758.2 million aggregate fair value of 5.000% senior unsecured notes. We accounted for this transaction as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The valuation and purchase accounting of this acquisition have not yet been finalized as of December 31, 2018.In March 2018, as more fully described in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we issued €750.0 million, or approximately $929.9 million in U.S. dollars, at the exchange rate in effect on March 14, 2018, aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior notes due March 15, 2024. We incurred debt issuance costs of $11.6 million related to the 2.875% Euro Senior Notes due 2024.41Table of ContentsOverview Equinix provides global data center offerings that protect and connect the world's most valued information assets. Global enterprises, financial services companies and content and network service providers rely upon Equinix's leading insight and data centers around the world for the safehousing of their critical IT equipment and the ability to directly connect to the networks that enable today's information-driven economy. The acquisitions of Infomart Dallas and Metronode expanded our total global footprint to 200 IBX data centers across 52 markets around the world. Equinix offers the following solutions: (i) premium data center colocation, (ii) interconnection and exchange and (iii) outsourced IT infrastructure solutions. As of December 31, 2018, we operated or had partner IBX data centers in Brazil, Canada, Colombia and throughout the U.S. in the Americas region; Bulgaria, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom in the EMEA region; and Australia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan and Singapore in the Asia-Pacific region. Our data centers in 52 markets around the world are a global platform, which allows our customers to increase information and application delivery performance while significantly reducing costs. This global platform and the quality of our IBX data centers have enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. As more customers choose our IBX data centers, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate with us as well, in order to gain the full economic and performance benefits of our offerings. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a ""marketplace"" for their services. Our global platform enables scalable, reliable and cost-effective colocation, interconnection and traffic exchange that lowers overall cost and increases flexibility. Our focused business model is built on our critical mass of customers and the resulting ""marketplace"" effect. This global platform, combined with our strong financial position, continues to drive new customer growth and bookings.Historically, our market has been served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled telecommunications products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include cloud computing/utility providers, application hosting providers and systems integrators, managed infrastructure hosting providers and colocation providers. More than 350 companies provide data center solutions in the U.S. alone. Each of these data center solutions providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings and outsourced IT infrastructure solutions. We are able to offer our customers a global platform that reaches 24 countries with proven operational reliability, improved application performance, network choice and a highly scalable set of offerings.Our utilization rate represents the percentage of our cabinet space billing versus net sellable cabinet space available, taking into account power limitations. Our utilization rates were approximately 81%, as of December 31, 2018, and 80%, excluding the Verizon Data Center, Paris IBX Data Center, Itconic, Zenium data center and IO acquisitions, as of December 31, 2017. Excluding the impact of IBX data center expansion projects that have opened during the last 12 months, our utilization rate would have increased to approximately 83% as of December 31, 2018. Our cabinet utilization rate varies from market to market among our IBX data centers across the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain high power-demand customers. This increased power consumption has driven us to build out our new IBX data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX data centers. We could face power limitations in our IBX data centers, even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific IBX data center. This could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given IBX data center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows. Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and offerings. As was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors, including but not limited to demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, lead-time to break even on a free cash flow basis and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. Depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to Equinix standards. Property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant.42Table of ContentsOur business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related interconnection and managed infrastructure offerings. We consider these offerings recurring because our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. In addition, during any given quarter of the past three years, more than half of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 3% of our recurring revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our 50 largest customers accounted for approximately 38%, 37% and 36%, respectively, of our recurring revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer's initial deployment and professional services we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring because they are billed typically once, upon completion of the installation or the professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. However, revenues from installation services are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of contract term. Additionally, revenue from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is generally treated as a contract modification and recognized ratably over the remaining term of the contract, if any. As a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future. The largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX data centers, utility costs, including electricity, bandwidth access, IBX data center employees' salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment and security services. A majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing IBX data centers or open or acquire new IBX data centers. However, there are certain costs that are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. We expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will generally increase in the future on a per-unit or fixed basis, in addition to the variable increase related to the growth in consumption by our customers. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months, as compared to other times of the year. To the extent we incur increased utility costs, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, to the extent we incur increased electricity costs as a result of either climate change policies or the physical effects of climate change, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, amortization of contract costs, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer relationship intangible assets.General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees, and other general corporate expenses, such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and some depreciation expense.We expect our cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses to grow in absolute dollars in connection with our business growth. We may periodically see a higher cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue when a large expansion project opens or is acquired, before it starts generating any meaningful revenue. Furthermore, in relation to cost of revenues, the Americas region has a lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue than either EMEA or Asia-Pacific. This is due to both the increased scale and maturity of the Americas region, compared to either the EMEA or Asia-Pacific region, as well as a higher cost structure outside of the Americas, particularly in EMEA. We expect the trend that the Americas having the lowest cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to continue. As a result, to the extent that revenue growth outside the Americas grows in greater proportion than revenue growth in the Americas, our overall cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may increase in future periods. Sales and marketing expenses may periodically increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to scale our operations by investing in sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenue, including the hiring of additional headcount and new product innovations. General and administrative expenses may also periodically increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to grow our business.Taxation as a REIT We elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 taxable year. As of December 31, 2018, our REIT structure included all of our data center operations in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the data center operations in EMEA with the exception of Bulgaria, United Arab Emirates and a portion of Turkey. Our data center operations in other jurisdictions are operated as TRSs.43Table of ContentsAs a REIT, we generally are permitted to deduct from our federal taxable income the dividends we pay to our stockholders (including, for this purpose, the value of any deemed distributions attributable to anti-dilution adjustments made with respect to our 4.75% convertible subordinated notes prior to their maturity in 2016). The income represented by such dividends is not subject to federal income tax at the entity level but is taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. Nevertheless, the income of our TRSs which hold our U.S. operations that may not be REIT compliant is subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income tax. Likewise, our foreign subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through TRSs or through QRSs. We are also subject to a separate corporate income tax on any gain recognized from a sale of a REIT asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a C corporation (such as (i) an asset that we held as of the effective date of our REIT election, that is, January 1, 2015, or (ii) an asset held by us or a QRS following the liquidation or other conversion of a former TRS). This built-in-gains tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a REIT asset (e.g., January 1, 2015 in the case of REIT assets we held at the time of our REIT conversion), to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a REIT asset. If we fail to remain qualified for federal income tax as a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate tax rates. Even if we remain qualified for federal income tax as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our TRSs' operations. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the federal income tax regime for REITs, many states do not completely follow federal rules and some may not follow them at all.On each of March 21, June 20, September 19, and December 12, 2018, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $2.28 per share. We expect these quarterly and other applicable distributions to equal or exceed the REIT taxable income that we recognized in 2018.On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""TCJA"") which amended U.S. federal income tax laws. The TCJA retained the REIT regime but contained many significant changes that impact a REIT's taxable income subject to distribution, particularly a REIT with global operations. As of the end of 2018, we have finalized the analysis of the major tax impact to our business by the new tax legislation. Based on our current assessment, which is subject to further interpretation and guidance on the new tax legislation, we believe that we can continue to meet all the REIT compliance requirements in the foreseeable future and that the TCJA changes are not expected to meaningfully increase our tax liabilities in the U.S. because we expect to fully distribute our REIT taxable income. We continue to monitor our REIT compliance in order to maintain our qualification for federal income tax as a REIT. For this and other reasons, as necessary, we may convert some of our data center operations in other countries into the REIT structure in future periods.Results of OperationsOur results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 include the results of operations from the Metronode Acquisition from April 18, 2018 and the Infomart Dallas Acquisition from April 2, 2018. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 include the results of operations of the IO Acquisition from February 3, 2017, the Verizon Data Center Acquisition from May 1, 2017, the Zenium data center acquisition from October 6, 2017 and the Itconic Acquisition from October 9, 2017. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 include the results of operations of TelecityGroup from January 15, 2016 and the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition from August 1, 2016.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (""ASU 2014-09"") and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance, collectively referred as ""Topic 606."" On January 1, 2018, as more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we adopted Topic 606. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under accounting standards in effect for those periods. Under the new standard, we recognize installation revenue over the contract period rather than over the estimated installation life as under the prior revenue standard. We also capitalize and amortize certain costs to obtain contracts, rather than expense them immediately as under the previous standard.Discontinued OperationsWe present the results of operations associated with the TelecityGroup data centers that were divested in July 2016 as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. We did not have any discontinued operations activity during 2018 or 2017.44Table of ContentsYears ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2018 % 2017 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas: Recurring revenues$2,357,326 46% $2,062,352 47% 14% 15%Non-recurring revenues127,408 3% 110,408 3% 15% 16% 2,484,734 49% 2,172,760 50% 14% 15%EMEA: Recurring revenues1,467,492 29% 1,266,971 29% 16% 12%Non-recurring revenues95,145 2% 79,285 2% 20% 16% 1,562,637 31% 1,346,256 31% 16% 12%Asia-Pacific: Recurring revenues951,684 19% 790,797 18% 20% 19%Non-recurring revenues72,599 1% 58,615 1% 24% 23% 1,024,283 20% 849,412 19% 21% 20%Total: Recurring revenues4,776,502 94% 4,120,120 94% 16% 15%Non-recurring revenues295,152 6% 248,308 6% 19% 18% $5,071,654 100% $4,368,428 100% 16% 15%Americas Revenues. Revenues for our Americas region for the year ended December 31, 2018 included approximately $210.2 million of incremental revenues from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, which closed in May 2017, and the Infomart Dallas Acquisition, which closed in April 2018. During both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our revenues from the United States, the largest revenue contributor in the Americas region for the periods, represented approximately 91% of the regional revenues. Excluding incremental revenues attributable to the Infomart Dallas and Verizon Data Center Acquisitions, growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to (i) $69.3 million of revenues generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Chicago, Culpeper, Denver, Houston, Miami, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Seattle, Silicon Valley, and Washington, D.C. areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the Brazilian real than during the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting in approximately $23.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Americas revenues during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to 2017 using average exchange rates. EMEA Revenues. Revenues for our EMEA region for the year ended December 31, 2018 included approximately $52.6 million of incremental revenues from the IO Acquisition, which closed in February 2017, and the Itconic and Zenium data center acquisitions, which closed in October 2017. Our revenues from the U.K., our largest revenue contributor in the EMEA region, represented 30% of regional revenues for both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Excluding incremental revenues attributable to the IO, Itconic, and Zenium acquisitions, our EMEA revenue growth was primarily due to (i) approximately $73.2 million of revenues from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $54.4 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA revenues primarily due to a generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and British pound during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Asia-Pacific Revenues. Revenues for our Asia-Pacific region for the year ended December 31, 2018 included approximately $48.0 million of incremental revenues from the Metronode Acquisition, which closed in April 2018. Our revenues from Japan and Singapore, the largest revenue contributors in the Asia-Pacific region for the period, combined represented approximately 60% and 63% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding incremental revenues attributable to the Metronode Acquisition, our Asia-Pacific revenue growth was primarily due to (i) approximately $59.2 million of revenues generated from our recently-opened IBX data center expansions in the Hong Kong, Melbourne, Osaka, and Singapore metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended December 31, 45Table of Contents2018, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Singapore dollar and Japanese yen than during the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting in approximately $7.7 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific revenues during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to 2017 using average exchange rates. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2018 % 2017 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$1,113,854 43% $958,845 44% 16% 18%EMEA916,751 35% 749,933 34% 22% 18%Asia-Pacific574,870 22% 484,371 22% 19% 18%Total$2,605,475 100% $2,193,149 100% 19% 18% Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues: Americas 45% 44%EMEA 59% 56%Asia-Pacific 56% 57%Total 51% 50%Americas Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues for our Americas region for the year ended December 31, 2018 included approximately $115.4 million of incremental cost of revenues from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition and the Infomart Dallas Acquisition. Excluding the impact from these acquisitions, the increase in our Americas cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to (i) $10.6 million higher depreciation expense primarily due to our IBX data center expansion activity; (ii) $7.6 million of higher taxes, licenses, insurance, and other cost of sales in support of our business growth; (iii) $5.8 million of higher rent and facility costs due to new fuel cell leases and IBX growth and (iv) $15.5 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and higher headcount growth (1,399 Americas cost of revenues employees as of December 31, 2018 versus 1,339 as of December 31, 2017). During the year ended December 31, 2018, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $15.1 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our Americas cost of revenues primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. We expect our Americas cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business, including results from recent acquisitions.EMEA Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues for our EMEA region for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $41.5 million of incremental cost of revenues from the IO, Itconic, and Zenium acquisitions. Excluding incremental cost of revenues attributable to these acquisitions, the increase in our EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $47.3 million of higher utilities costs driven by IBX expansions, increased usage and price increases; (ii) $18.4 million of higher office expenses, rent and facility costs, and repair and maintenance primarily due to an increase in expansion activity and usage due to our business growth; (iii) $49.3 million of higher depreciation and accretion expenses, primarily driven by expansion activity in Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, and Paris and (iv) $19.7 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and higher headcount growth (1,490 EMEA cost of revenues employees as of December 31, 2018 versus 1,375 as of December 31, 2017), partially offset by an $11.8 million reduction in other cost of sales, primarily due to realized cash flow hedge gains. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $30.0 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA cost of revenues, primarily due to a generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and British pound during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. We expect EMEA cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business.Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues for our Asia-Pacific region for the year ended December 31, 2018 included approximately $33.2 million incremental cost of revenues from the Metronode Acquisition. Excluding the impact from the Metronode Acquisition, the increase in our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to (i) $28.4 million of higher utilities costs, rent and facility costs and repairs and maintenance expense, primarily driven by higher usage in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore; (ii) $16.1 million of higher depreciation and accretion expense, primarily from IBX expansions in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore; (iii) $9.7 million of higher other cost of sales, primarily due 46Table of Contentsto custom service orders, and (iv) $3.9 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (884 Asia-Pacific cost of revenues employees as of December 31, 2018 versus 828 as of December 31, 2017). During the year ended December 31, 2018, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Singapore dollar and Japanese yen than during the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting in approximately $3.3 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues in 2018. We expect Asia-Pacific cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business, including the impact from the Metronode acquisition.Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % Change 2018 % 2017 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$391,386 62% $349,666 60% 12% 13%EMEA152,336 24% 153,811 26% (1)% (4)%Asia-Pacific89,980 14% 78,247 14% 15% 14%Total$633,702 100% $581,724 100% 9% 8% Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues: Americas16% 16%EMEA10% 11%Asia-Pacific9% 9%Total12% 13%Americas Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our Americas sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to (i) $38.1 million of amortization of the acquired intangible assets in connection with the Verizon Data Center Acquisition and (ii) $5.4 million of higher consulting expenses to support our growth. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Americas sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2017. We anticipate that we will continue to invest in Americas sales and marketing initiatives and expect our Americas sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as we continue to grow our business, including the impact from recent acquisitions.EMEA Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our EMEA sales and marketing expense did not materially change during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.8 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA sales and marketing expenses primarily due to a generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and British pound during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our EMEA sales and marketing initiatives to further increase our revenues. We expect our EMEA sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as we continue to grow our business.Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expense is primarily due to (i) $4.1 million of amortization of the acquired intangible assets in connection with the Metronode Acquisition; (ii) $4.1 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (306 Asia-Pacific sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2018, versus 278 as of December 31, 2017) and (iii) $4.4 million of higher bad debt expense, primarily due to customer recovery in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2017. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing initiatives and expect our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase as we continue to grow our business, including the impact from the Metronode acquisition.47Table of ContentsGeneral and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2018 % 2017 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$554,169 67% $472,942 63% 17% 18%EMEA184,364 22% 195,430 26% (6)% (8)%Asia-Pacific88,161 11% 77,534 11% 14% 12%Total$826,694 100% $745,906 100% 11% 10% Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017General and Administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues: Americas22% 22%EMEA12% 15%Asia-Pacific9% 9%Total16% 17%Americas General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $25.8 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and headcount growth (1,389 Americas general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2018 versus 1,207 as of December 31, 2017); (ii) $18.1 million of higher office, rent and facilities costs and consulting expenses in support of our business growth; (iii) $3.8 million of higher recruiting, training, and travel expenses to support employee development and (iv) $30.2 million of higher depreciation expense associated with the implementation of certain systems, including revenue, data management and cloud exchange systems, to improve our quote to order and billing processes and to support the integration and growth of our business. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Americas general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2017. Over the course of the past year, we have been investing in our Americas general and administrative functions to scale our business effectively for growth, which has included additional investments in improving our back office systems. We expect our current efforts to improve our back office systems will continue over the next several years. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect Americas general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to further scale our operations to support our growth, including these investments in our back office systems, investments to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and recent acquisitions and to comply with new accounting standards.EMEA General and Administrative Expenses. The decrease in our EMEA general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $23.1 million of lower amortization expense as a result of fully amortizing the TelecityGroup trade names during the third quarter of 2017; (ii) $5.2 million decrease due to realized cash flow hedge gains and (iii) $5.1 million lower outside services consulting expense, partially offset by an increase of $19.6 million of compensation expenses, including general salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (830 EMEA general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2018 versus 807 as of December 31, 2017). During the year ended December 31, 2018, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $5.2 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA general and administrative expenses primarily due to a generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and British pound during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Over the course of the past year, we have been investing in our EMEA general and administrative functions as a result of our ongoing efforts to scale this region effectively for growth. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect our EMEA general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to scale our operations to support our growth.Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expense was primarily due to $9.7 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (482 Asia-Pacific general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2018 versus 453 as of December 31, 2017). For the year ended December 31, 2018, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2017. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to support our growth, including the impact from the Metronode acquisition.48Table of ContentsAcquisition Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $34.4 million primarily in the Asia-Pacific and Americas regions, due to our acquisitions of Metronode and Infomart Dallas. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $38.6 million, primarily in the Americas region, due to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition.Impairment Charges. We did not have impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.Gain on Asset Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a gain on asset sales of $6.0 million primarily relating to the sale of a data center in Frankfurt. We did not have any gain on asset sales during the year ended December 31, 2017.Income from Operations. Our income from operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2018 % 2017 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$412,610 42% $363,220 45% 14% 15%EMEA312,163 32% 237,854 29% 31% 25%Asia-Pacific252,610 26% 207,940 26% 21% 20%Total$977,383 100% $809,014 100% 21% 19%Americas Income from Continuing Operations. The increase in our Americas income from operations was primarily due to higher income generated from acquisitions, higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the Brazilian real than during the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting in approximately $4.0 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact on our Americas income from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to 2017 using average exchange rates. EMEA Income from Continuing Operations. The increase in our EMEA income from operations was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and acquisitions, as described above, as well as lower sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues, which was partially due to lower amortization costs as a result of fully amortizing the TelecityGroup trade names during the third quarter of 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $14.5 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA income from continuing operations primarily due to a generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro and British pound during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.Asia-Pacific Income from Continuing Operations. The increase in our Asia-Pacific income from operations was primarily due to higher income generated from the Metronode Acquisition, higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above and lower cost of sales as a percentage of revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the U.S. dollar was generally weaker relative to the Singapore dollar and Japanese yen than during the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting in approximately $3.2 million of favorable foreign currency impact on our Asia-Pacific income from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to 2017 using average exchange rates. Interest Income. Interest income was $14.5 million and $13.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 1.24% versus 0.64% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $521.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $478.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to our issuance of the €750.0 million 2.875% Euro Senior Notes due 2024 in March 2018 and $750 million 5.000% Infomart Senior Notes in April 2018. The increase was partially offset by lower weighted average interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we capitalized $19.9 million and $22.6 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. We expect to incur higher interest expense in future periods in connection with additional indebtedness that we incurred during 2018 and as a result of the increasing interest rates. Other Income (Expense). We recorded net other income of $14.0 million and $9.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains and losses during the periods.Loss on Debt Extinguishment. We recorded $51.4 million net loss on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2018, comprised of (i) $17.1 million of loss on debt extinguishment as a result of amendments to leases impacting the related 49Table of Contentsfinancing obligations; (ii) $19.5 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the settlement of financing obligations as a result of the Infomart Dallas Acquisition; (iii) $12.6 million of loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the settlement of financing obligations for properties purchased and (iv) $2.2 million of loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the redemption of the Japanese Yen Term Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded $65.8 million net loss on debt extinguishment comprised of (i) $14.6 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the early redemption of the senior notes; (ii) $22.5 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the redemption of term loans under the previously outstanding credit facility; (iii) $16.7 million of loss on debt extinguishment as a result of amendments to leases and financing obligations and (iv) $12.0 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the settlement of financing obligations as a result of properties purchased.Income Taxes. We operate as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income distributed to stockholders. We intend to distribute or have distributed the entire taxable income generated by the operations of our QRSs for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. As such, other than tax attributable to built-in-gains recognized and withholding taxes, no provision for U.S. income taxes for the QRSs has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. We have made TRS elections for some of our subsidiaries in and outside the U.S. In general, a TRS may provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs to provide and may hold assets that REITs cannot hold directly. U.S. income taxes for the TRS entities located in the U.S. and foreign income taxes for our foreign operations regardless of whether the foreign operations are operated as QRSs or TRSs have been accrued, as necessary, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded $67.7 million and $53.9 million of income tax expenses, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 15.6% and 18.8%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2018 as compared to 2017 is primarily due to a release of valuation allowance in the current period as a result of a legal entity reorganization in our Americas region. Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a key factor in how we assess the operating performance of our segments and develop regional growth strategies such as IBX data center expansion decisions. We define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs and gain on asset sales. See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below for more information about adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to income or loss from operations.

Our revenues from the U.K., our largest revenue contributor in the EMEA region, represented 30% of regional revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 32% of regional revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the acquisitions, our EMEA revenue growth was primarily due to (i) approximately $62.3 million of revenue from our IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions in the Amsterdam, Dubai, Dublin, Frankfurt, Helsinki, London, Paris and Zurich metro areas and (ii) an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.9 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA revenues primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Asia-Pacific Revenues. Our revenues from Japan, the largest revenue contributor in the Asia-Pacific region, represented approximately 34% and 35%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Cost of revenues for our Americas region for the year ended December 31, 2017 included approximately $177.4 million of costs of revenues attributable to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition. Excluding the impact from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, depreciation expense was $273.0 million and $241.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The growth in depreciation expense was primarily due to our IBX expansion activity. In addition to the increase in depreciation expense, the increase in our Americas cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to (i) $30.4 million of higher utilities, repairs and maintenance, property taxes, and other cost of sales in support of our business growth and (ii) $13.2 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation (1,114 Americas cost of revenues employees, excluding the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, as of December 31, 2017 versus 1,023 as of December 31, 2016). During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $7.7 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Americas cost of revenues primarily due to a generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Brazilian real and Canadian dollar during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. EMEA Cost of Revenues. As compared to 2016, cost of revenues for our EMEA region for the year ended December 31, 2017 included $36.7 million of incremental cost of revenues attributable to acquisitions, including the TelecityGroup Acquisition that closed on January 15, 2016, the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition that closed in August 2016, the IO Acquisition, which closed in February 2017, and the Itconic and Zenium data center acquisitions, which closed in October 2017. Excluding cost of revenues attributable to these acquisitions, the increase in our EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $25.5 million of higher utilities in support of our business growth; (ii) $16.4 million of higher other cost of sales, including third party and managed service expenses; (iii) $10.7 million of higher depreciation expense and (iv) $7.2 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation (743 EMEA cost of revenues employees, excluding TelecityGroup employees, as of December 31, 2017 versus 623 as of December 31, 2016). During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $2.7 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA cost of revenues, primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. The increase in our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily due to (i) $16.7 million of higher utilities, rent, facility costs, consulting, bandwidth cost, custom service orders and repairs and maintenance costs in support of our business growth and (ii) $3.3 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation and headcount growth (828 Asia-Pacific cost of revenues employees as of December 31, 2017 versus 787 as of December 31, 2016), partially offset by a decrease of $3.2 million in depreciation and accretion expenses. During the year ended 52Table of ContentsDecember 31, 2017, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the Japanese Yen than during the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting in approximately $5.0 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues in 2017. Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2017 % 2016 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$349,666 60% $230,900 53% 51% 51%EMEA153,811 26% 137,887 31% 12% 14%Asia-Pacific78,247 14% 69,955 16% 12% 13%Total$581,724 100% $438,742 100% 33% 33% Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues: Americas16% 14%EMEA11% 12%Asia-Pacific9% 9%Total13% 12%Americas Sales and Marketing Expenses.

EMEA Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in the EMEA sales and marketing expense was primarily due to (i) $12.3 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (378 EMEA sales and marketing employees as of December 31, 2017 versus 349 as of December 31, 2016) and (ii) an increase of $1.8 million in depreciation and amortization expense, primarily due to acquisitions made during the current year. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $2.8 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA sales and marketing expenses primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. The increase in the Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expense is primarily due to (i) $6.5 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and a larger average headcount in 2017 as compared to 2016 and (ii) $3.2 million of higher rent expense in support of our growth.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations to our Americas general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2016. Over the course of the past year, we have been investing in our Americas general and administrative functions to scale this region effectively for growth, which has included additional investments in improving our back office systems. We expect our current efforts to improve our back office systems will continue over the next several years. Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect Americas general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to further scale our operations to support our growth, including these investments in our back office systems and investments to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT. EMEA General and Administrative Expenses. The decrease in our EMEA general and administrative expenses was primarily due to (i) $20.8 million of lower amortization expenses as a result of fully amortizing the TelecityGroup trade names during the current period and (ii) $8.4 million of lower consulting expenses which was largely due to the completion of TelecityGroup integration activities in the current period. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $5.7 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA general and administrative expenses primarily due to a generally stronger U.S. dollar relative to the British pound during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Over the course of the past year, we have been investing in our EMEA general and administrative functions as a result of our ongoing efforts to scale this region effectively for growth. Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. The increase in our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expense was primarily due to $5.0 million of higher compensation costs, including general salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth (453 Asia-Pacific general and administrative employees as of December 31, 2017 versus 358 as of December 31, 2016), partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in rent, repair and maintenance expense. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses was not significant when compared to average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2016. Acquisition Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $38.6 million primarily in the Americas and EMEA regions, of which $28.5 million was related to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2017 attributable to the Americas region. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded acquisition costs totaling $64.2 million primarily in the EMEA region due to the acquisitions of Telecity and the Paris IBX Data Center, and to a lesser degree, to the Americas region.Impairment Charges.

Our income from operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2017 % 2016 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$363,220 45% $352,180 57% 3% 3%EMEA237,854 29% 124,853 20% 91% 85%Asia-Pacific207,940 26% 141,706 23% 47% 47%Total$809,014 100% $618,739 100% 31% 30%Americas Income from Continuing Operations. Our Americas income from continuing operations did not change significantly year over year. While revenues increased as described above, this was largely offset by (i) an increase of $18.6 million in acquisition costs, which was primarily related to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition; (ii) additional amortization of the acquired intangible assets resulted from the Verizon Data Center Acquisition and (iii) higher cost of revenues and sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Americas income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was not significant when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. EMEA Income from Continuing Operations. The increase in our EMEA income from continuing operations was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and acquisitions, as described above, as well as lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, lower amortization costs as a result of fully amortizing the TelecityGroup trade names during the current period and lower acquisition costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2017. We incurred $9.2 million of acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $54.5 million of acquisition costs during the year ended December 31, 2016, which was primarily related to our acquisition of TelecityGroup. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $6.4 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA income from continuing operations primarily due to a generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.Asia-Pacific Income from Continuing Operations. The increase in our Asia-Pacific income from continuing operations was primarily due to higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above and lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our Asia-Pacific income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was not significant when compared to average exchange rates of the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest Income. Interest income was $13.1 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in interest income was driven by higher cash balances and interest yield rates for the year ended December 31, 2017. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 0.64% versus 0.37% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $478.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $392.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to the Term B-2 Loan borrowings of €1.0 billion and the issuance of $1.25 billion of 2027 Senior Notes in March 2017, as well as additional financings such as various capital lease and other financing obligations to support our expansion projects. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we capitalized $22.6 million and $13.3 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. Other Income (Expense). We recorded net other income of $9.2 million and net expense of $57.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains and losses during the periods, including $63.5 million in foreign currency losses recognized in the first quarter of 2016 as a result of completing the acquisition of TelecityGroup.Loss on Debt Extinguishment. We recorded $65.8 million net loss on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2017 comprised of (i) $14.6 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the early redemption of the senior notes; (ii) $22.5 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the redemption of term loans under the previously outstanding credit facility; (iii) $16.7 million of loss on debt extinguishment as a result of amendments to leases and financing obligations and (iv) $12.0 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the settlement of financing obligations of properties purchased. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $12.3 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the settlement of the financing obligations for our Paris 3 IBX data center, a portion of the lender fees associated with the Japanese Yen Term Loan, and the prepayment and termination of our 2012 and 2013 Brazil financings. 55Table of ContentsIncome Taxes. We operate as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are generally not subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income distributed to stockholders. We intend to distribute or have distributed the entire taxable income generated by the operations of our REIT and QRSs for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. As such, other than built-in-gains recognized and withholding taxes, no provision for U.S. income taxes for the REIT and QRSs has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We have made TRS elections for some of our subsidiaries in and outside the U.S. In general, a TRS may provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs to provide and may hold assets that REITs cannot hold directly. U.S. income taxes for the TRS entities located in the U.S. and foreign income taxes for our foreign operations regardless of whether the foreign operations are operated as QRSs or TRSs have been accrued, as necessary, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded $53.9 million and $45.5 million of income tax expenses, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 18.8% and 28.4%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily due to recognition of unrecognized tax benefits related to our tax positions in the U.S. and Brazil as a result of a lapse in statutes of limitations and lower amount of non-deductible expenses within our EMEA operations. This is partially offset by net deferred tax asset remeasurement in the U.S. TRSs due to the corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 as a result of the TCJA. Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a key factor in how we assess the operating performance of our segments and develop regional growth strategies such as IBX data center expansion decisions. We define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations plus depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs and gain on asset sales. See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below for more information about adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to income or loss from operations. Our adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2017 % 2016 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$1,034,694 51% $787,311 47% 31% 31%EMEA582,697 28% 494,263 30% 18% 17%Asia-Pacific434,650 21% 375,900 23% 16% 16%Total$2,052,041 100% $1,657,474 100% 24% 24%Americas Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our Americas adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, higher revenues as result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above. During the year ended December 31, 2017, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $4.5 million of net favorable foreign currency impact on our Americas adjusted EBITDA primarily due to the U.S. dollar being generally weaker relative to the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.EMEA Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our EMEA adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, currency fluctuations resulted in approximately $2.1 million of net favorable foreign currency impact to our EMEA adjusted EBITDA primarily due to a generally weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.Asia-Pacific Adjusted EBITDA. The increase in our Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth, as described above, and lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the U.S. dollar was generally stronger relative to the Japanese Yen than during the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting in approximately $2.7 million of net unfavorable foreign currency impact to our Asia-Pacific revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to average exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2016. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but we believe that evaluating our ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, we use non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operations. 56Table of ContentsNon-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We have presented such non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and ability to perform in subsequent periods. We believe that if we did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze Equinix effectively. Investors should note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by us may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. Investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing non-GAAP financial measures used by us to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. Our primary non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted funds from operations (""AFFO""), exclude depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of our IBX data centers and do not reflect our current or future cash spending levels to support our business. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of an IBX data center do not recur with respect to such data center, although we may incur initial construction costs in future periods with respect to additional IBX data centers, and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to our initial investment. This is a trend we expect to continue. In addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of our IBX data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs incurred to build out our IBX data centers and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. Therefore, we exclude depreciation from our operating results when evaluating our operations. In addition, in presenting adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, we exclude amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense is significantly affected by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions and these charges may vary in amount from period to period. We exclude amortization expense to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our prior periods. We exclude accretion expense, both as it relates to asset retirement obligations as well as accrued restructuring charge liabilities, as these expenses represent costs which we believe are not meaningful in evaluating our current operations. We exclude stock-based compensation expense, as it can vary significantly from period to period based on share price, the timing, size and nature of equity awards. As such, we, and many investors and analysts, exclude stock-based compensation expense to compare our operating results with those of other companies. We also exclude restructuring charges. The restructuring charges relate to our decisions to exit leases for excess space adjacent to several of our IBX data centers, which we did not intend to build out, or our decision to reverse such restructuring charges. We also exclude impairment charges related to certain long-lived assets. The impairment charges are related to expense recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets are not recoverable. We also exclude gain or loss on asset sales as it represents profit or loss that is not meaningful in evaluating the current or future operating performance. Finally, we exclude acquisition costs from AFFO and adjusted EBITDA to allow more comparable comparisons of our financial results to our historical operations. The acquisition costs relate to costs we incur in connection with business combinations. Such charges generally are not relevant to assessing the long-term performance of the company. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions. Management believes items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, gain or loss on asset sales and acquisition costs are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs may occur in future periods.57Table of ContentsAdjusted EBITDAWe define adjusted EBITDA as income from operations excluding depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs, and gain on asset sales as presented below (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016Income from operations$977,383 $809,014 $618,739Depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense1,226,741 1,028,892 843,510Stock-based compensation expense180,716 175,500 156,148Acquisition costs34,413 38,635 64,195Impairment charges— — 7,698Gain on asset sales(6,013) — (32,816)Adjusted EBITDA$2,413,240 $2,052,041 $1,657,474Our adjusted EBITDA results have improved each year and in each region in total dollars due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in ""Results of Operations"", as well as the nature of our business model consisting of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature also discussed earlier in ""Overview"".Funds from Operations (""FFO"") and AFFOWe use FFO and AFFO, which are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in the REIT industry. FFO is calculated in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. FFO represents net income (loss), excluding gain (loss) from the disposition of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items. In presenting AFFO, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future operating performance. AFFO represents FFO excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate assets, accretion, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition costs, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, a contract cost adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums, gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and noncontrolling interests' share of these items and net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax. The adjustments for installation revenue, straight-line rent expense and contract costs are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight-lined or amortized results in the consolidated statement of operations. We exclude the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings that have no current or future cash obligations. We exclude gain (loss) on debt extinguishment since it generally represents the write-off of initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings or a cost that is incurred to reduce future interest costs and is not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance. We include an income tax expense adjustment, which represents the non-cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes that do not relate to current period's operations. We deduct recurring capital expenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of its IBX data centers or other assets that are required to support current revenues. We also exclude net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, which represents results that may not recur and are not a good indicator of our current future operating performance.58Table of ContentsOur FFO and AFFO were as follows (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016Net income$365,359 $232,982 $126,800Adjustments: Real estate depreciation and amortization883,118 754,351 626,564(Gain) loss on disposition of real estate property4,643 4,945 (28,388)Adjustments for FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures— 85 113FFO$1,253,120 $992,363 $725,089 Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016FFO$1,253,120 $992,363 $725,089Adjustments: Installation revenue adjustment10,858 24,496 20,161Straight-line rent expense adjustment7,203 8,925 7,700Contract cost adjustment(20,358) — —Amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums13,618 24,449 18,696Stock-based compensation expense180,716 175,500 156,149Non-real estate depreciation expense140,955 111,121 87,781Amortization expense203,416 177,008 122,862Accretion expense (adjustment)(748) (13,588) 6,303Recurring capital expenditures(203,053) (167,995) (141,819)Loss on debt extinguishment51,377 65,772 12,276Acquisition costs34,413 38,635 64,195Impairment charges— — 7,698Net income from discontinued operations, net of tax— — (12,392)Income tax expense adjustment(12,420) 371 3,680Adjustments for AFFO from unconsolidated joint ventures— (17) (40)AFFO$1,659,097 $1,437,040 $1,078,339Our AFFO results have improved due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in ""Results of Operations,"" as well as due to the nature of our business model which consists of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature as discussed earlier in ""Overview."" Constant Currency PresentationOur revenues and certain operating expenses (cost of revenues, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses) from our international operations have represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues and certain operating expenses. As a result, our revenues and certain operating expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. dollar against major international currencies such as the Euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar, Australian dollar and Brazilian real. In order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present period-over-period percentage changes in our revenues and certain operating expenses on a constant currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, we have presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results. To present this information, our current and comparative prior period revenues and certain operating expenses from entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2017 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2018 when comparing the year 59Table of Contentsended December 31, 2018 with the year ended December 31, 2017, and average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2016 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2017 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2017 with the year ended December 31, 2016). Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of December 31, 2018, our total indebtedness was comprised of debt and financing obligations totaling approximately $11.4 billion consisting of (a) approximately $8,500.1 million of principal from our senior notes, (b) approximately $1,518.9 million from our capital lease and other financing obligations and (c) $1,390.4 million of principal from our loans payable and mortgage (gross of debt issuance cost, debt discount, plus debt premium).We believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of the current portion of our debt as it becomes due, payment of regular dividend distributions and completion of our publicly-announced expansion projects.On March 14, 2018, we issued €750.0 million 2.875% Euro Senior Notes due 2024. On April 2, 2018, we completed the Infomart Dallas Acquisition for a purchase price of approximately $804.0 million, which was funded with approximately $45.8 million in cash and $758.2 million aggregate fair value of 5.000% senior unsecured notes. On April 18, 2018, we completed the Metronode Acquisition for a cash purchase price of A$1.034 billion or approximately $804.6 million at the exchange rate in effect on April 18, 2018. In July, we drew down the full amount of the JPY Term Loan of ¥47.5 billion, or approximately $424.7 million at the exchange rate effective on July 31, 2018, and prepaid the remaining principal of our existing Japanese Yen Term Loan of ¥43.8 billion or approximately $391.3 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had $610.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $280.1 million was held in the U.S. We believe that our current expansion activities in the U.S. can be funded with our U.S.-based cash and cash equivalents and investments. In addition to our cash and investment portfolio, we have additional liquidity available to us from our $2.0 billion revolving facility and the 2018 ATM Program as described below. As of December 31, 2018, we had 42 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $68.5 million issued and outstanding under the revolving facility. We had a total of approximately $1.9 billion of additional liquidity available to us under the Revolving Facility. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold 930,934 shares for approximately $388.2 million, net of payment of commissions to the sales agents and equity offering costs under our 2017 ATM Program. As of December 31, 2018, no shares remain available for sale under the 2017 ATM Program. In December 2018, we launched the 2018 ATM Program to sell up to $750.0 million of common stock in at the market offerings. As of December 31, 2018, no shares have been sold under the 2018 ATM Program. Besides any further financing activity we may pursue, customer collections are our primary source of cash. While we believe we have a strong customer base, and have continued to experience relatively strong collections, if the current market conditions were to deteriorate, some of our customers may have difficulty paying us and we may experience increased churn in our customer base, including reductions in their commitments to us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Additionally, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build out of new IBX data centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as potential acquisitions and joint ventures. While we expect to fund these plans with our existing resources, additional financing, either debt or equity, may be required, and if current market conditions were to deteriorate, we may be unable to secure additional financing, or any such additional financing may only be available to us on unfavorable terms. An inability to pursue additional expansion opportunities will have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our desired level of revenue growth in future periods.Sources and Uses of Cash Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in thousands)Net cash provided by operating activities$1,815,426 $1,439,233 $1,019,353Net cash used in investing activities(3,075,528) (5,400,826) (2,045,668)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities470,912 4,607,860 (897,065)60Table of ContentsOperating ActivitiesOur cash provided by our operations is generated by colocation, interconnection, managed infrastructure and other revenues. Our primary use of cash from our operating activities include compensation and related costs, interest payments, other general corporate expenditures and taxes. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to improved operating results combined with incremental operating cash provided by the acquisitions of Infomart Dallas and Metronode in April 2018 and inclusion of full year operating results of the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues, operating expenses, interest expense and income taxes. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to improved operating results combined with incremental operating cash provided by the Verizon Data Center Acquisition and other acquisitions in 2017, offset by timing of collections on our receivables and increases in cash paid for cost of revenues, operating expenses, interest expense and income taxes. Investing ActivitiesThe decrease in net cash used in investing activities during 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the decrease in spending for business acquisitions of approximately of $3.1 billion, primarily due to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition in 2017, partially offset by $717.4 million of higher capital expenditures and $87.3 million of higher purchases of real estate, primarily as a result of expansion activity. The increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the increase in spending for business acquisitions of approximately of $2.2 billion, primarily related to the Verizon Data Center Acquisition, a decrease in proceeds from asset sales of $803.8 million, $265.4 million of higher capital expenditures and $67.0 million of higher purchases of real estate, primarily as a result of expansion activity.During 2019, we anticipate our IBX expansion construction activity will increase from our 2018 levels. If the opportunity to expand is greater than planned and we have sufficient funding to pursue such expansion opportunities, we may further increase the level of capital expenditure to support this growth as well as pursue additional business and real estate acquisitions or joint ventures.Financing ActivitiesNet cash provided by financing activities during 2018 was primarily due to (i) the issuance of €750.0 million 2.875% Euro Senior Notes due 2024, or approximately $929.9 million in U.S. dollars, at the exchange rate in effect on March 14, 2018; (ii) borrowing of the JPY Term Loan of ¥47.5 billion, or approximately $424.7 million at the exchange rate effective on July 31, 2018; (iii) sale of 930,934 shares under the 2017 ATM Program, for net proceeds of $388.2 million and (iv) proceeds from employee awards of $50.1 million. The proceeds were partially offset by (i) dividend distributions of $738.6 million; (ii) repayments of capital lease and other financing obligations of $103.8 million; (iii) repayments of mortgage and loans payable of $447.5 million, primarily related to the prepayment of the remaining principal of our existing Japanese Yen Term Loan; (iv) payments of debt extinguishment costs of $20.6 million and (v) payments of debt issuance costs of $12.2 million. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2017 was primarily due to (i) borrowings under our previously outstanding credit facility of €1,000.0 million, or approximately $1,059.8 million at the exchange rate in effect on January 6, 2017; (ii) the issuance of $1,250.0 million 2027 Senior Notes; (iii) the issuance of €1,000.0 million 2025 Euro Senior Notes, or approximately $1,199.7 million at the exchange rate on September 20, 2017; (iv) the issuance of €1,000.0 million 2026 Euro Senior Notes, approximately $1,179.0 million at the exchange rate on December 12, 2017; (v) borrowings under our Term Loan Facility of approximately $997.1 million on December 12, 2017, at the exchange rate in effect on that day; (vi) the sale of common stock for net proceeds of $2,481.4 million and (vii) proceeds from employee awards of $41.7 million, partially offset by (i) repayment of the entire $500.0 million principal amount of our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2020; (ii) repayment in full of our previously outstanding credit facility of approximately $2,207.7 million in total at the exchange rate on December 12, 2017; (iii) dividend distributions of $621.5 million; (iv) repayments of capital lease and other financing obligations of $93.5 million and (v) debt issuance costs of $81.0 million. Net cash used in financing activities during 2016 was primarily due to (i) $1,462.9 million repayment of loans payable including repayment of loans assumed in the TelecityGroup acquisition, bridge term loan and revolving credit facility; (ii) $114.4 million repayment of capital lease and other financing obligations and (iii) $499.5 million payment of dividends, partially offset by $1,168.3 million of proceeds from loans payable including proceeds from our previously outstanding credit facility and Japanese Yen Term Loan. 61Table of ContentsDebt ObligationsDebt FacilitiesWe have various debt obligations with maturity dates ranging from 2019 to 2027 under which a total principal balance of $9.9 billion remained outstanding as of December 31, 2018.

Other contractual commitments are described below.(6) Represents liability, net of future accretion expense.In connection with certain of our leases and other contracts requiring deposits, we entered into 42 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $68.5 million under the revolving credit facility. These letters of credit were provided in lieu of cash deposits. If the landlords for these IBX leases decide to draw down on these letters of credit triggered by an event of default under the lease, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowing under the revolving credit facility. These contingent commitments are not reflected in the table above.We had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaling approximately $106.9 million as of December 31, 2018. These liabilities, which are reflected on our balance sheet, are not reflected in the table above since it is unclear when these liabilities will be paid.Primarily as a result of our various IBX data center expansion projects, as of December 31, 2018, we were contractually committed for $687.6 million of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for IBX equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided in connection with the work necessary to complete construction and open these IBX data centers prior to making them available to customers for installation. This amount, which is expected to be paid during 2019 and thereafter, is reflected in the table above as ""other contractual commitments.""We had other non-capital purchase commitments in place as of December 31, 2018, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods, services or arrangements that may contain 62Table of Contentsembedded leases to be delivered or provided during 2019 and beyond. Such other purchase commitments as of December 31, 2018, which total $837.5 million, are also reflected in the table above as ""other contractual commitments.""Additionally, we entered into lease agreements in various locations for a total lease commitment of approximately $262.2 million, excluding potential lease renewals. These lease agreements will commence between February 2019 and May 2020 with lease terms of 5 to 30 years, which are not reflected in the table above. Other Off-Balance-Sheet ArrangementsWe have various guarantor arrangements with both our directors and officers and third parties, including customers, vendors and business partners. As of December 31, 2018, there were no significant liabilities recorded for these arrangements. For additional information, see ""Guarantor Arrangements"" in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require significant judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain:•Accounting for income taxes;•Accounting for business combinations;•Accounting for impairment of goodwill; and•Accounting for property, plant and equipment.63Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Income Taxes.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or settled. The accounting standard for income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined by the accounting standard as a likelihood of more than 50%) that such assets will not be realized.A tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authority's widely understood administrative practices and precedents.The TCJA included a Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (""GILTI"") provision that increases U.S. federal taxable income by certain foreign subsidiary income in the year it is earned. Our accounting policy is to treat any tax on GILTI inclusions as a current period cost included in the tax expense in the year incurred. The Company believes the GILTI inclusion provision will result in no financial statement impact provided the Company satisfies its REIT distribution requirement with respect to the GILTI inclusions.Our qualification and taxation as a REIT depends on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. Our ability to satisfy quarterly asset tests depends upon our analysis and the fair market values of our REIT and non-REIT assets. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future events. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. If, based on the weight of that available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified.This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account a number of types of evidence, including the following: 1) the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, 2) sources of future taxable income and 3) tax planning strategies.In assessing the tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position, the tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.For purposes of the quarterly REIT asset tests, we estimate the fair market value of assets within our QRSs and TRSs using a discounted cash flow approach, by calculating the present value of forecasted future cash flows. We apply discount rates based on industry benchmarks relative to the market and forecasting risks. Other key assumptions used to estimate the fair market value of assets in QRSs and TRSs include projected revenue growth, operating margins and forecasted capital expenditure. We revisit key assumptions periodically to reflect any changes due to business or economic environment. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had net total deferred tax liabilities of $189.6 million and $186.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had a total valuation allowance of $57.0 million and $84.6 million, respectively. If and when we reduce our remaining valuation allowances, it may have a favorable impact to our financial position and results of operations in the periods when such determinations are made. We will continue to assess the need for our valuation allowances, by country or location, in the futureDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we released the full valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets of one of our Brazilian legal entities, certain Japanese entities and partial valuation allowance against the Spanish deferred tax assets acquired from the Itconic acquisition as a result of legal entities reorganizations in the Americas, APAC and EMEA regions. As part of the purchase accounting determination for the Metronode Acquisition, we provided full valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets in Australia that are not expected to be realizable in the foreseeable future. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we provided full and partial valuation allowances against the Spanish and Turkish deferred tax assets acquired from the Itconic and Zenium data center acquisitions, respectively. In addition, we set up a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with excess tax goodwill established as a result of a reorganization in Brazil. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $150.9 million and $82.4 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the unrecognized tax benefits increased by $68.5 million primarily due to the Metronode Acquisition and the reorganization of the Spanish entities from the Itconic acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the unrecognized tax benefits increased by $10.2 million primarily due to the TelecityGroup integrations which was partially offset by the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits related to the Company's tax positions in the U.S. and Brazil as a result of a lapse in statutes of limitations. The unrecognized tax benefits of $114.9 million as of December 31, 2018, if subsequently recognized, will affect our effective tax rate favorably at the time when such benefits are recognized.64Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Business CombinationsIn accordance with the accounting standard for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as customer contracts, leases and any other significant assets or liabilities and contingent consideration, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date if we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires assumptions and management's judgment to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Key judgments used to estimate the fair value of intangible assets include projected revenue growth and operating margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. During the last three years, we have completed a number of business combinations, including the Metronode Acquisition and the Infomart Dallas Acquisition in April 2018, the Itconic Acquisition and the Zenium data center acquisition in October 2017, the Verizon Data Center Acquisition in May 2017, the IO Acquisition in February 2017, the Paris IBX Data Center Acquisition in August 2016 and the TelecityGroup acquisition in January 2016. In 2018, we have finalized the purchase price allocation for the Verizon Data Center, Itconic and Zenium data center acquisitions. The purchase price allocation for the IO, Paris IBX Data Center and TelecityGroup acquisitions were completed in prior years. As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had net intangible assets of $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion and $719.2 million, respectively. We recorded amortization expense for intangible assets of $203.4 million, $177.0 million and $122.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we used to complete the purchase price allocations and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, which would be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in 2019 or beyond. 65Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsIn accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform goodwill and other intangible assets impairment reviews annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We complete the annual goodwill impairment assessment for the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific reporting units to determine if the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values. We perform a review of other intangible assets for impairment by assessing events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. To perform annual goodwill impairment assessment, we elected to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. This analysis requires assumptions and estimates before performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test, where the assessment requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. There were no specific factors present in 2018 or 2017 that indicated a potential goodwill impairment. We performed our annual review of other intangible assets by assessing if there were events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, such as a significant decrease in market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset or a continuous deterioration of our financial condition. This assessment requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. There were no specific events in 2018 or 2017 that indicated a potential impairment.As of December 31, 2018, goodwill attributable to the Americas, the EMEA and the Asia-Pacific reporting units was $1.7 billion, $2.5 billion and $616.4 million, respectively.Future events, changing market conditions and any changes in key assumptions may result in an impairment charge. While we have not recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill to date, the development of adverse business conditions in our Americas, EMEA or Asia-Pacific reporting units, such as higher than anticipated customer churn or significantly increased operating costs, or significant deterioration of our market comparables that we use in the market approach, could result in an impairment charge in future periods.The balance of our other intangible assets, net, for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $2.3 billion. While we have not recorded an impairment charge against our other intangible assets to date, future events or changes in circumstances, such as a significant decrease in market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate, may result in an impairment charge in future periods. Any potential impairment charge against our goodwill and other intangible assets would not exceed the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.66Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Property, Plant and EquipmentWe have a substantial amount of property, plant and equipment recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The vast majority of our property, plant and equipment represent the costs incurred to build out or acquire our IBX data centers. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets. We depreciate our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (subject to the term of the lease in the case of leased assets or leasehold improvements and integral equipment located in leased properties). Accounting for property, plant and equipment includes determining the appropriate period in which to depreciate such assets, making assessments for leased properties to determine whether they are capital or operating leases, determining if construction projects performed at leased properties trigger build-to-suit lease accounting, assessing such assets for potential impairment, capitalizing interest during periods of construction and assessing the asset retirement obligations required for certain leased properties that require us to return the leased properties back to their original condition at the time we decide to exit a leased property.Judgments are required in arriving at the estimated useful life of an asset and changes to these estimates would have significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. When we lease a property for our IBX data centers, we generally enter into long-term arrangements with initial lease terms of at least 8-10 years and with renewal options generally available to us. In the next several years, a number of leases for our IBX data centers will come up for renewal. As we start approaching the end of these initial lease terms, we will need to reassess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment. In addition, we may find that our estimates for the useful lives of non-leased assets may also need to be revised periodically. We periodically review the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment and changes in these estimates in the future are possible. Another area of judgment for us in connection with our property, plant and equipment is related to lease accounting. Some of our IBX data centers are leased. Each time we enter into a new lease or lease amendment for one of our IBX data centers, we analyze each lease or lease amendment for the proper accounting. This requires certain judgments such as establishing the lease term to include in a lease test, establishing the remaining estimated useful life of the underlying property or equipment and estimating the fair value of the underlying property or equipment, establishing the incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payment for the lease test. All of these judgments are inherently uncertain. Different assumptions or estimates could result in a different accounting treatment for a lease.The assessment of long-lived assets for impairment requires assumptions and estimates of undiscounted and discounted future cash flows. These assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and are inherently uncertain.As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had property, plant and equipment of $11.0 billion, $9.4 billion, and $7.2 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded depreciation expense of $1.0 billion, $865.5 million, and $714.3 million, respectively. While we evaluated the appropriateness, we did not revise the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Further changes in our estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment could have a significant impact on our results of operations.As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had property, plant and equipment under capital leases of $823.6 million, $760.4 million and $715.3 million, respectively. We recorded accumulated depreciation for assets under capital leases of $248.9 million, $199.2 million and $161.4 million as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded rent expense of approximately $185.4 million, $157.9 million and $140.6 million respectively. Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee ""Recent Accounting Pronouncements"" in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.67Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket Risk The following discussion about market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity.We employ foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging certain specifically-identified exposures. The use of these financial instruments is intended to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, but does not eliminate such risks. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Investment Portfolio RiskWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities that is prioritized on meeting REIT asset requirements. All of our marketable securities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair values recognized in net income. We consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge for our securities, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. We anticipate that we will recover the entire cost basis of these securities and have determined that no other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were required to be recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018.As of December 31, 2018, our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market funds, certificates of deposits and publicly traded equity securities. The amount in our investment portfolio that could be susceptible to market risk totaled $124.1 million.Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our outstanding debt. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates from their position as of December 31, 2018 would not have a material impact on our interest expense due to the fixed coupon rate on the majority of our debt obligations. However, the interest expense associated with our senior credit facility and term loans, that bear interest at variable rates, could be affected. For every 100 basis point change in interest rates, our annual interest expense could increase by a total of approximately $12.7 million or decrease by a total of approximately $5.6 million based on the total balance of our primary borrowings under the Term Loan Facility as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we had not employed any interest rate derivative products against our debt obligations. However, we may enter into interest rate hedging agreements in the future to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk.The fair value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate changes may affect the fair value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair value of our mortgage and loans payable and 5.000% Infomart Senior Notes, which are not traded in the market, is estimated by considering our credit rating, current rates available to us for debt of the same remaining maturities and the terms of the debt. The fair value of our other senior notes, which are traded in the market, was based on quoted market prices. The following table represents the carrying value and estimated fair value of our mortgage and loans payable and senior notes as of (in thousands): December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Carrying Value (1) Fair Value Carrying Value (1) Fair ValueMortgage and loans payable$1,388,524 $1,389,632 $1,468,275 $1,464,877Senior notes8,500,125 8,422,211 7,002,000 7,288,673 (1) The carrying value is gross of debt issuance cost, debt discount and debt premium.Foreign Currency Risk A significant portion of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, however, approximately 55.3% of our revenues and 53.5% of our operating costs are attributable to Brazil, Canada, Colombia and the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions, and a large portion of those revenues and costs are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Australian dollar and Brazilian real. To help manage the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we have implemented a number of hedging programs, in particular (i) a cash flow hedging program 68Table of Contentsto hedge the forecasted revenues and expenses in our EMEA region, (ii) a balance sheet hedging program to hedge the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, and (iii) a net investment hedging program to hedge the long term investments in our foreign subsidiaries. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of cash flows. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts had maturities of up to two years.We have entered into various foreign currency debt obligations. As of December 31, 2018, the total principal amount of foreign currency debt obligations was $4.5 billion, including $3.2 billion denominated in Euro, $612.7 million denominated in British Pound, $427.8 million denominated in Japanese Yen and $304.0 million denominated in Swedish Krona. As of December 31, 2018, we have designated $4.1 billion of the total principal amount of foreign currency debt obligations as net investment hedges against our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. For a net investment hedge, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument designated as a net investment hedge, except the ineffective portion and forward points, are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. We did not record any ineffectiveness during the year ended December 31, 2018.Fluctuations in the exchange rates between these foreign currencies (i.e. Euro, British Pound, Swedish Krona and Japanese Yen) and the U.S. Dollar will impact the amount of U.S. dollars that we will require to settle the foreign currency debt obligations at maturity. If the U.S. Dollar would have been weaker or stronger by 10% in comparison to these foreign currencies as of December 31, 2018, we estimate our obligation to cash settle the principal of these foreign currency debt obligations in U.S. dollars would have increased or decreased by approximately $449.5 million respectively. For the foreseeable future, we anticipate that approximately 50% of our revenues and operating costs will continue to be generated and incurred outside of the U.S. in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. During fiscal 2018, the U.S. dollar became generally stronger relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate. This overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar had a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations because the foreign denominations translated into less U.S. dollars. In future periods, the volatility of the U.S. dollar as compared to the other currencies in which we do business could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations including the amount of revenue that we report in future periods.With the existing cash flow hedges in place, a hypothetical additional 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2018 would have resulted in a reduction of our revenues and operating expenses, including depreciation and amortization expenses, for the year by approximately $137.1 million and $145.1 million, respectively.With the existing cash flow hedges in place, a hypothetical additional 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2018 would have resulted in an increase of our revenues and operating expenses, including depreciation and amortization expenses, for the year by approximately $175.1 million and $179.4 million, respectively.We may enter into additional hedging activities in the future to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency risk as our exposure to foreign currency risk continues to increase due to our growing foreign operations; however, we do not currently intend to eliminate all foreign currency transaction exposure. Commodity Price RiskCertain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of price changes are electricity, supplies and equipment used in our IBX data centers. We closely monitor the cost of electricity at all of our locations. We have entered into several power contracts to purchase power at fixed prices in certain locations in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom.In addition, as we are building new, or expanding existing, IBX data centers, we are subject to commodity price risk for building materials related to the construction of these IBX data centers, such as steel and copper. In addition, the lead-time to procure certain pieces of equipment, such as generators, is substantial. Any delays in procuring the necessary pieces of equipment for the construction of our IBX data centers could delay the anticipated openings of these new IBX data centers and, as a result, increase the cost of these projects.We do not currently employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to address commodity price risk other than the power contracts discussed above.69Table of Contents",2023-12-30 20:28:36.371717

For the discussion of 2017 items and 2018 results as compared to 2017 results, please refer to Item 7 of our 2018 Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on February 22, 2019.Our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist readers in understanding our financial information from our management's perspective and is presented as follows:•Overview•Results of Operations•Non-GAAP Financial Measures•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements•Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates•Recent Accounting PronouncementsOverview Equinix provides a global, vendor-neutral data center, interconnection and edge services platform with offerings that aim to enable our customers to reach everywhere, interconnect everyone and integrate everything. Global enterprises, service providers and business ecosystems of industry partners rely on Equinix IBX data centers and expertise around the world for the safe housing of their critical IT equipment and to protect and connect the world's most valued information assets. They also look to Platform Equinix® for the ability to directly and securely interconnect 41Table of Contentsto the networks, clouds and content that enable today's information-driven global digital economy. Recent Equinix IBX data center openings and acquisitions, as well as xScale data center investments, have expanded our total global footprint to 210 IBX and xScale data centers across 55 markets around the world. Equinix offers the following solutions:•premium data center colocation;•interconnection and data exchange solutions;•edge services for deploying networking, security and hardware; and•remote expert support and professional services.Our interconnected data centers around the world allow our customers to increase information and application delivery performance to users, and quickly access distributed IT infrastructures and business and digital ecosystems, while significantly reducing costs. The Equinix global platform and the quality of our IBX data centers, interconnection offerings and edge services have enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. As more customers choose Platform Equinix, for bandwidth cost and performance reasons it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate in the same data centers. This adjacency creates a “network effect” that enables our customers to capture the full economic and performance benefits of our offerings. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a ""marketplace"" for their services. Our global platform enables scalable, reliable and cost-effective interconnection that increases data traffic exchange while lowering overall cost and increasing flexibility. Our focused business model is built on our critical mass of enterprise and service provider customers and the resulting ""marketplace"" effect. This global platform, combined with our strong financial position, continues to drive new customer growth and bookings.Historically, our market was served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled their products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include private and vendor-neutral multitenant data center providers, hyperscale cloud providers, managed infrastructure and application hosting providers, and systems integrators. It is estimated that Equinix is one of more than 1,200 companies that provide MTDC offerings around the world. Each of these data center solutions providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings and outsourced IT infrastructure solutions. We are able to offer our customers a global platform that reaches 26 countries with the industry’s largest and most active ecosystem of partners in our sites, proven operational reliability, improved application performance and a highly scalable set of offerings.The cabinet utilization rate represents the percentage of cabinet space billed versus total cabinet capacity, which is used to measure how efficiently we are managing our cabinet capacity. Our cabinet utilization rate varies from market to market among our IBX data centers across the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. Our cabinet utilization rates were approximately 79% and 81%, respectively, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. Excluding the impact of our IBX data center expansion projects that have opened during the last 12 months, our cabinet utilization rate would have increased to approximately 82% as of December 31, 2019. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain high power-demand customers. This increased power consumption has driven us to build out our new IBX data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX data centers. We could face power limitations in our IBX data centers, even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific IBX data center. This could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given IBX data center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, operating results and cash flows.In 2019, we closed our Joint Venture with GIC to develop and operate xScale data centers to serve the needs of the growing hyperscale data center market, including the world's largest cloud service providers. Upon closing, the Joint Venture acquired certain data center facilities in Europe, with the opportunity to add additional facilities to the Joint Venture in the future.Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and offerings. As was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors, including but not limited to demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, clouds and software partners, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, automation capabilities, developer 42Table of Contentstalent pool, lead-time to break even on a free cash flow basis and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. Depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to Equinix standards. Property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant.Revenue:Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related interconnection and managed infrastructure offerings. We consider these offerings recurring because our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. In addition, during the past three years, more than 80% of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 3% of our recurring revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Our 50 largest customers accounted for approximately 39%, 38% and 37%, respectively, of our recurring revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer's initial deployment and professional services we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring because they are billed typically once, upon completion of the installation or the professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. However, revenues from installation services are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the contract term. Additionally, revenue from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is generally treated as a contract modification and recognized ratably over the remaining term of the contract, if any. As a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future. Operating Expenses:Cost of Revenues. The largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX data centers, utility costs, including electricity, bandwidth access, IBX data center employees' salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment and security. A majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing IBX data centers or open or acquire new IBX data centers. However, there are certain costs that are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. We expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will generally increase in the future on a per-unit or fixed basis, in addition to the variable increase related to the growth in consumption by our customers. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months, as compared to other times of the year. To the extent we incur increased utility costs, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, to the extent we incur increased electricity or other costs as a result of either climate change policies or the physical effects of climate change, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 43Table of ContentsSales and Marketing. Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, amortization of contract costs, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer relationship intangible assets.General and Administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees, and other general corporate expenses, such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and some depreciation expense on back office systems.Taxation as a REIT We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 taxable year. As of December 31, 2019, our REIT structure included all of our data center operations in the U.S., Canada, Japan, Singapore and the data center operations in EMEA with the exception of Bulgaria, the United Arab Emirates, and the data center operations outside Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Our data center operations in other jurisdictions are operated as TRSs. We included our interest in the Joint Venture in our REIT structure.As a REIT, we generally are permitted to deduct from our U.S. taxable income the dividends we pay to our stockholders. The income represented by such dividends is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the entity level but is taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. Nevertheless, the income of our TRSs which hold our U.S. operations that may not be REIT compliant is subject to U.S. corporate federal and state income taxes, as applicable. Likewise, our foreign subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through TRSs or through QRSs. We are also subject to a separate U.S. federal corporate income tax on any gain recognized from a sale of a REIT asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a C corporation (such as an asset held by us or a QRS following the liquidation or other conversion of a former TRS). This built-in-gains tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a REIT asset to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a REIT asset. If we fail to remain qualified for U.S. federal income taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates. Even if we remain qualified for U.S. federal income taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our TRSs' operations. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the U.S. federal income tax regime for REITs, many states do not completely follow federal rules, and some may not follow them at all.We continue to monitor our REIT compliance in order to maintain our qualification for U.S. federal income taxation as a REIT. For this and other reasons, as necessary, we may convert some of our data center operations in other countries into the REIT structure in future periods. We converted our data center operations in Singapore into the REIT structure effective September 30, 2019.On each of March 20, June 19, September 18, and December 11, 2019, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $2.46 per share. We expect these quarterly and other applicable distributions to equal or exceed the REIT taxable income that we recognized in 2019.2019 Highlights:•In March, we issued and sold 2,985,575 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $1,213.4 million, after underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. See Note 12 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In April, we completed the acquisition of Switch Datacenters' AMS1 data center business in Amsterdam, Netherlands (the ""AM11 data center""), for a cash purchase price of approximately €30.6 million, or approximately $34.3 million. See Note 3 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In October, we closed our Joint Venture with GIC to develop and operate xScale data centers in Europe. Upon closing, we sold certain data center facilities in Europe to the Joint Venture. See Note 5 and Note 6 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In November, we issued $2.8 billion in Senior Notes due 2024, 2026 and 2029 with a weighted average interest rate of 2.93% and redeemed $1.9 billion in Senior Notes due 2022, 2023 and 2025 with a weighted average interest rate of 5.47% in November and December 2019. See Note 11 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.44Table of Contents•By the end of December, we had sold 903,555 shares of our common stock for approximately $447.7 million in proceeds, net of payment of commissions and other offering expenses, under our current ATM program. See Note 12 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.Results of OperationsOur results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 include the results of operations from the acquisition of the AM11 data center from April 18, 2019 within the EMEA region. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 include the results of operations from the acquisition of Metronode from April 18, 2018 within the Asia-Pacific region and the acquisition of Infomart Dallas from April 2, 2018 within the Americas region.Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflect the adoption of Topic 842, Leases, while the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the lease accounting standard in effect for those periods. See Note 1 within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. In order to provide a framework for assessing our performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we supplement the year-over-year actual change in operating results with comparative changes on a constant currency basis. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further discussion. Years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2019 % 2018 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas: Recurring revenues$2,456,368 44% $2,357,326 46% 4% 5%Non-recurring revenues131,359 3% 127,408 3% 3% 4% 2,587,727 47% 2,484,734 49% 4% 5%EMEA: Recurring revenues1,680,746 30% 1,467,492 29% 15% 12%Non-recurring revenues125,698 2% 95,145 2% 32% 39% 1,806,444 32% 1,562,637 31% 16% 14%Asia-Pacific: Recurring revenues1,101,072 20% 951,684 19% 16% 17%Non-recurring revenues66,897 1% 72,599 1% (8)% (6)% 1,167,969 21% 1,024,283 20% 14% 16%Total: Recurring revenues5,238,186 94% 4,776,502 94% 10% 10%Non-recurring revenues323,954 6% 295,152 6% 10% 13% $5,562,140 100% $5,071,654 100% 10% 10%45Table of ContentsRevenues (dollars in thousands)Americas Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Americas revenue increased by 4% (5% on a constant currency basis). Growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to:•approximately $10.6 million of incremental revenues from the Infomart Dallas acquisition;•$52.6 million of incremental revenues generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions; and•an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period.EMEA Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2019, EMEA revenue increased by 16% (14% on a constant currency basis). Growth in EMEA revenues was primarily due to:•approximately $76.0 million of incremental revenues generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions;•an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period; and•a net increase of $110.6 million of realized cash flow hedge gains from foreign currency forward contracts.Asia-Pacific Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Asia-Pacific revenue increased by 14% (16% on a constant currency basis). Growth in Asia-Pacific revenue was primarily due to:•approximately $16.6 million of incremental revenues from the Metronode acquisition;•approximately $35.4 million of incremental revenues generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions; and•an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period.46Table of ContentsCost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2019 % 2018 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$1,146,639 41% $1,113,854 43% 3% 4%EMEA1,017,580 36% 916,751 35% 11% 12%Asia-Pacific645,965 23% 574,870 22% 12% 14%Total$2,810,184 100% $2,605,475 100% 8% 9%Cost of Revenues (dollars in thousands; percentages indicate expenses as a percentage of revenues)Americas Cost of Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Americas cost of revenues increased by 3% (4% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Americas cost of revenues was primarily due to:•$11.3 million of higher utilities costs driven by IBX data center expansions, increased utility usage and utility price increases; •$10.0 million of higher bandwidth costs in support of our business growth;•approximately $9.9 million of incremental cost of revenues from the Infomart Dallas acquisition;•$8.6 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation; and•$7.2 million of higher depreciation expense primarily due to IBX expansion activity.This increase was partially offset by:•$8.9 million of reduced property tax expenses, primarily due to accrual releases based on tax appeal settlements; and•$6.9 million of reduced office expenses.EMEA Cost of Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2019, EMEA cost of revenues increased by 11% (12% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to:•a net increase of $40.6 million of realized cash flow hedge losses from foreign currency forward contracts;•$30.5 million of higher utilities costs driven by increased utility usage to support IBX data center expansions and utility price increases, primarily in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom;•$21.3 million of higher costs from increased equipment resale activities, primarily in Germany and the United Kingdom;47Table of Contents•$7.9 million of higher depreciation expenses driven by IBX data center expansions in London, Frankfurt and Amsterdam; and•$7.2 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth.This increase was partially offset by:•$5.9 million of reduced outside services consulting expenses.Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Asia-Pacific cost of revenues increased by 12% (14% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily due to:•$45.3 million of higher rent and facility costs and utilities costs, primarily driven by expansions and higher utility usage in Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and Japan;•$20.5 million of higher depreciation expense, primarily from IBX data center expansions in Singapore, Japan, Australia and Hong Kong;•approximately $11.2 million of incremental cost of revenues from the Metronode acquisition; and•$4.3 million of higher outside services consulting expenses.This increase was partially offset by:•$12.8 million of reduced costs due to lower equipment resale activities in the current period as compared to the prior year.We expect Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific cost of revenues to increase as we continue to grow our business, including from the impact of acquisitions.48Table of ContentsSales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, % Change 2019 % 2018 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$401,034 62% $391,386 62% 2% 3%EMEA157,718 24% 152,336 24% 4% 4%Asia-Pacific92,294 14% 89,980 14% 3% 4%Total$651,046 100% $633,702 100% 3% 3%Sales and Marketing Expenses(dollars in thousands; percentages indicate expenses as a percentage of revenues)Americas Sales and Marketing Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Americas sales and marketing expenses increased by 2% (3% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Americas sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to:•$7.4 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, salaries and stock-based compensation and headcount growth; and •$3.7 million of higher travel and entertainment expenses.EMEA Sales and Marketing Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2019, EMEA sales and marketing increased by 4% (and also 4% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to:•a net increase of $7.2 million of realized cash flow hedge losses from foreign currency forward contracts; and•$5.6 million increase in compensation costs, including sales compensation, salaries and stock-based compensation and headcount growth.This increase was partially offset by:•$6.2 million of reduced amortization expense driven by certain intangibles being fully amortized in the current year.Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expense did not materially change during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. 49Table of ContentsWe anticipate that we will continue to invest in Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific sales and marketing initiatives and expect our Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses to increase as we grow our business. Additionally, given that certain global sales and marketing functions are located within the U.S., we expect Americas sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to be higher than our other regions.General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2019 % 2018 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$641,261 69% $554,169 67% 16% 16%EMEA198,892 21% 184,364 22% 8% 7%Asia-Pacific94,865 10% 88,161 11% 8% 9%Total$935,018 100% $826,694 100% 13% 13%General and Administrative Expenses (dollars in thousands; percentages indicate expenses as a percentage of revenues)Americas General and Administrative Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Americas general and administrative expenses increased by 16% (and also 16% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to:•$51.1 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and headcount growth;•$22.3 million of higher depreciation expense associated with the implementation of certain systems to support the integration and growth of our business; and•$10.7 million of higher consulting expenses in support of our business growth.EMEA General and Administrative Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2019, EMEA general and administrative expenses increased by 8% (7% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA general and administrative expenses was primarily due to:•a net increase of $8.8 million of realized cash flow hedge losses from foreign currency forward contracts; and•$3.9 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth.50Table of ContentsAsia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses increased by 8% (9% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expense was primarily due to:•$3.8 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and headcount growth.Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to further scale our operations to support our growth, including investments in our back office systems and investments to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and to integrate recent acquisitions. Additionally, given that our corporate headquarters is located within the U.S., we expect Americas general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to be higher than our other regions.Transaction Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded transaction costs totaling $24.8 million primarily related to costs incurred in connection with the formation of the new Joint Venture in the EMEA region. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded transaction costs totaling $34.4 million, primarily in the Asia-Pacific and Americas regions, due to our acquisitions of Metronode and Infomart Dallas.Impairment Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairment charges totaling $15.8 million in the Americas region primarily as a result of the fair value adjustment for the New York 12 (""NY12"") data center, which was classified as a held for sale asset before it was sold in October 2019. We did not have impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2018.Gain on Asset Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a gain on asset sales of $44.3 million primarily relating to the sale of both the London 10 and Paris 8 data centers, as well as certain construction development and leases in London and Frankfurt, as part of the closing of the Joint Venture. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded gain on asset sales of $6.0 million primarily relating to the sale of a data center in Frankfurt.Income from Operations. Our income from operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2019 % 2018 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$413,936 35% $412,610 42% —% 1%EMEA421,786 36% 312,163 32% 35% 24%Asia-Pacific333,909 29% 252,610 26% 32% 35%Total$1,169,631 100% $977,383 100% 20% 17%Americas Income from Operations. Our Americas income from operations did not materially change during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. EMEA Income from Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, EMEA income from operations increased by 35% (24% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA income from operations was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth, as described above, as well as lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. Asia-Pacific Income from Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Asia-Pacific income from operations increased by 32% (35% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Asia-Pacific income from operations was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity, acquisition and organic growth as described above, lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues and lower transaction costs in the current period as compared to the prior year. Interest Income. Interest income was $27.7 million and $14.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 1.85% versus 1.24% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $479.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $521.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily attributable to the reduction in lease interest expense 51Table of Contentsdue to the conversion of certain build-to-suit leases to operating leases upon the adoption of ASC 842 and the utilization of cross-currency interest rate swaps in 2019. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we capitalized $32.2 million and $19.9 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress.Other Income. We recorded net other income of $27.8 million and $14.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Other income is primarily comprised of foreign currency exchange gains and losses during the periods.Loss on Debt Extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $52.8 million of loss on debt extinguishment primarily related to the loss on debt extinguishment from the redemption of the Senior Notes due 2022, 2023 and 2025. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded $51.4 million of loss on debt extinguishment comprised of:•$17.1 million of loss on debt extinguishment as a result of amendments to leases impacting the related financing obligations;•$19.5 million of loss on debt extinguishment from the settlement of financing obligations as a result of the Infomart Dallas acquisition;•$12.6 million of loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the settlement of financing obligations for properties purchased; and•$2.2 million of loss on debt extinguishment as a result of the redemption of the Japanese Yen Term Loan.Income Taxes. We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are generally not subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes on our taxable income distributed to stockholders. We intend to distribute or have distributed the entire taxable income generated by the operations of our REIT and QRSs for the tax years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As such, other than tax attributable to built-in-gains recognized and withholding taxes, no provision for U.S. federal income taxes for the REIT and QRSs has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. We have made TRS elections for some of our subsidiaries in and outside the U.S. In general, a TRS may provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs to provide and may hold assets that may not be REIT compliant.U.S. federal income taxes for the TRS entities located in the U.S. and foreign income taxes for our foreign operations regardless of whether the foreign operations are operated as QRSs or TRSs have been accrued, as necessary, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded $185.4 million and $67.7 million of income tax expenses, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 26.8% and 15.6%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The higher effective tax rate in 2019 as compared to 2018 is primarily due to a release of valuation allowance in 2018 as a result of a legal entity reorganization in our Americas region. Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a key factor in how we assess the operating performance of our segments and develop regional growth strategies such as IBX data center expansion decisions. We define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations excluding depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs and gain on asset sales. See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below for more information about adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to income or loss from operations. Our adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands): Years Ended December 31, % Change 2019 % 2018 % Actual Constant CurrencyAmericas$1,237,622 46% $1,183,831 49% 5% 5%EMEA827,980 31% 698,280 29% 19% 17%Asia-Pacific622,125 23% 531,129 22% 17% 19%Total$2,687,727 100% $2,413,240 100% 11% 12%52Table of ContentsAmericas Adjusted EBITDA. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Americas adjusted EBITDA increased by 5% (and also 5% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Americas adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity, acquisition and organic growth as described above. EMEA Adjusted EBITDA. During the year ended December 31, 2019, EMEA adjusted EBITDA increased by 19% (17% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth, as described above, as well as lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Asia-Pacific Adjusted EBITDA. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA increased by 17% (19% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity, acquisition and organic growth as described above and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but we believe that evaluating our ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, we use non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operations. Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We have presented such non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and ability to perform in subsequent periods. We believe that if we did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze Equinix effectively. Investors should note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by us may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. Investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing non-GAAP financial measures used by us to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. Our primary non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted funds from operations (""AFFO""), exclude depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of our IBX data centers and do not reflect our current or future cash spending levels to support our business. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of an IBX data center do not recur with respect to such data center, although we may incur initial construction costs in future periods with respect to additional IBX data centers, and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to our initial investment. This is a trend we expect to continue. In addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of our IBX data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs incurred to build out our IBX data centers and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. Therefore, we exclude depreciation from our operating results when evaluating our operations. 53Table of ContentsIn addition, in presenting adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, we exclude amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense is significantly affected by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions and these charges may vary in amount from period to period. We exclude amortization expense to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our prior periods. We exclude accretion expense, both as it relates to asset retirement obligations as well as accrued restructuring charge liabilities, as these expenses represent costs which we believe are not meaningful in evaluating our current operations. We exclude stock-based compensation expense, as it can vary significantly from period to period based on share price, the timing, size and nature of equity awards. As such, we, and many investors and analysts, exclude stock-based compensation expense to compare our operating results with those of other companies. We also exclude restructuring charges. The restructuring charges relate to our decisions to exit leases for excess space adjacent to several of our IBX data centers, which we did not intend to build out, or our decision to reverse such restructuring charges. We also exclude impairment charges related to certain long-lived assets. The impairment charges are related to expense recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets are not recoverable. We also exclude gain or loss on asset sales as it represents profit or loss that is not meaningful in evaluating the current or future operating performance. Finally, we exclude transaction costs from AFFO and adjusted EBITDA to allow more comparable comparisons of our financial results to our historical operations. The transaction costs relate to costs we incur in connection with business combinations and the formation of joint ventures, including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Such charges generally are not relevant to assessing the long-term performance of the company. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the transactions. Management believes items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, gain or loss on asset sales and transaction costs are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs may occur in future periods.Adjusted EBITDAWe define adjusted EBITDA as income from operations excluding depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs, and gain on asset sales as presented below (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017Income from operations$1,169,631 $977,383 $809,014Depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense1,285,296 1,226,741 1,028,892Stock-based compensation expense236,539 180,716 175,500Transaction costs24,781 34,413 38,635Impairment charges15,790 — —Gain on asset sales(44,310) (6,013) —Adjusted EBITDA$2,687,727 $2,413,240 $2,052,041Our adjusted EBITDA results have improved each year and in each region in total dollars due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in ""Results of Operations"", as well as the nature of our business model consisting of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature also discussed earlier in ""Overview"".Funds from Operations (""FFO"") and AFFOWe use FFO and AFFO, which are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in the REIT industry. FFO is calculated in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. FFO represents net income (loss), excluding gain (loss) from the disposition of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items.In presenting AFFO, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future operating performance. AFFO represents FFO excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate assets, accretion, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, a contract cost adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums, gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures, net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, and adjustments 54Table of Contentsfrom FFO to AFFO for unconsolidated joint ventures' and noncontrolling interests' share of these items. The adjustments for installation revenue, straight-line rent expense and contract costs are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight-lined or amortized results in the consolidated statement of operations. We exclude the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings that have no current or future cash obligations. We exclude gain (loss) on debt extinguishment since it generally represents the write-off of initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings or a cost that is incurred to reduce future interest costs and is not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance. We include an income tax expense adjustment, which represents the non-cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes that do not relate to current period's operations. We deduct recurring capital expenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of its IBX data centers or other assets that are required to support current revenues. We also exclude net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, which represents results that may not recur and are not a good indicator of our current future operating performance.Our FFO and AFFO were as follows (in thousands): Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017Net income$507,245 $365,359 $232,982Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests205 — —Net income attributable to Equinix507,450 365,359 232,982Adjustments: Real estate depreciation845,798 883,118 754,351(Gain) loss on disposition of real estate property(39,337) 4,643 4,945Adjustments for FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures645 — 85FFO$1,314,556 $1,253,120 $992,363 Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017FFO$1,314,556 $1,253,120 $992,363Adjustments: Installation revenue adjustment11,031 10,858 24,496Straight-line rent expense adjustment8,167 7,203 8,925Contract cost adjustment(40,861) (20,358) —Amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums13,042 13,618 24,449Stock-based compensation expense236,539 180,716 175,500Non-real estate depreciation expense242,761 140,955 111,121Amortization expense196,278 203,416 177,008Accretion expense (adjustment)459 (748) (13,588)Recurring capital expenditures(186,002) (203,053) (167,995)Loss on debt extinguishment52,825 51,377 65,772Transaction costs24,781 34,413 38,635Impairment charges15,790 — —Income tax expense adjustment39,676 (12,420) 371Adjustments for AFFO from unconsolidated joint ventures2,080 — (17)AFFO$1,931,122 $1,659,097 $1,437,040Our AFFO results have improved due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in ""Results of Operations,"" as well as due to the nature of our business model which consists of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature as discussed earlier in ""Overview.""55Table of ContentsConstant Currency PresentationOur revenues and certain operating expenses (cost of revenues, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses) from our international operations have represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues and certain operating expenses. As a result, our revenues and certain operating expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. dollar against major international currencies. During the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018, the U.S. dollar was stronger relative to the Brazilian real, Euro, British Pound, Singapore dollar and Australian dollar, which resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency impact on revenue, operating income and adjusted EBITDA, and a favorable foreign currency impact on operating expenses. In order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present period-over-period percentage changes in our revenues and certain operating expenses on a constant currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. Our constant currency presentation excludes the impact of our foreign currency cash flow hedging activities. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, we have presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our operating results. To present this information, our current period revenues and certain operating expenses from entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2018 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2019 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2019 with the year ended December 31, 2018). Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of December 31, 2019, our total indebtedness was comprised of debt and lease obligations totaling approximately $11.9 billion (gross of debt issuance cost, debt discount, plus mortgage premium) consisting of:•approximately $9,029.2 million of principal from our senior notes;•approximately $1,506.1 million from our finance lease liabilities; and •$1,371.9 million of principal from our loans payable and mortgage.We believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of the current portion of our debt as it becomes due, payment of regular dividend distributions and completion of our publicly-announced expansion projects.During 2019, we completed the following significant financing activities:•issued $2,800.0 million in Senior Notes due 2024, 2026 and 2029;•redeemed $1,906.3 million of Senior Notes due 2022, 2023 and 2025;•repaid $300.0 million of 5.0% Infomart Senior Notes according to their repayment terms;•issued and sold 2,985,575 shares of common stock in a public equity offering and received net proceeds of approximately $1,213.4 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses; and•issued and sold 903,555 shares of common stock under our ATM Program, for proceeds of approximately $447.5 million, net of payment of commissions to sales agents and other offering expenses.As of December 31, 2019, we had $1,879.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $1,456.8 million was held in the U.S. In addition to our cash and investment portfolio, we had $1.9 billion of additional liquidity available to us from our $2.0 billion revolving facility and $300.0 million of shares issuance available for sale under our ATM Program. Besides any further financing activity we may pursue, customer collections are our primary source of cash. While we believe we have a strong customer base, and have continued to experience relatively strong collections, if the current market conditions were to deteriorate, some of our customers may have difficulty paying us and we may experience increased churn in our customer base, including reductions in their commitments to us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Additionally, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build out of new IBX data centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as potential acquisitions and joint ventures. While we expect to fund these plans with our existing resources, additional financing, either debt or equity, may be required, and if current market conditions were to deteriorate, we 56Table of Contentsmay be unable to secure additional financing, or any such additional financing may only be available to us on unfavorable terms. An inability to pursue additional expansion opportunities will have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our desired level of revenue growth in future periods.Sources and Uses of Cash Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 (in thousands)Net cash provided by operating activities$1,992,728 $1,815,426Net cash used in investing activities(1,944,567) (3,075,528)Net cash provided by financing activities1,202,082 470,912Operating ActivitiesOur cash provided by our operations is generated by colocation, interconnection, managed infrastructure and other revenues. Our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include compensation and related costs, interest payments, other general corporate expenditures and taxes. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to improved operating results combined with the inclusion of full year operating results of the acquisitions of Infomart Dallas and Metronode closed in April 2018, offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues, operating expenses, interest expense and income taxes.Investing ActivitiesThe decrease in net cash used in investing activities during 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to the decrease in spending for business acquisitions of approximately $795.5 million, primarily due to the Metronode and Infomart Dallas acquisitions in 2018 combined with an increase in proceeds from asset sales of approximately $346.6 million, primarily due to the sale of xScale data center facilities in connection with the closing of the Joint Venture. During 2020, we anticipate our IBX expansion construction activity will increase from our 2019 levels. If the opportunity to expand is greater than planned and we have sufficient funding to pursue such expansion opportunities, we may further increase the level of capital expenditure to support this growth as well as pursue additional business and real estate acquisitions or joint ventures.Financing ActivitiesNet cash provided by financing activities during 2019 was primarily due to:•the issuance of $2,800.0 million in Senior Notes due 2024, 2026 and 2029;•the sale and issuance of 2,985,575 shares of common stock in a public equity offering and receipt of net proceeds of approximately $1,213.4 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses; •the sale of 903,555 shares under our ATM Program, for net proceeds of $447.5 million; and•proceeds from employee awards of $52.0 million.The proceeds were partially offset by:•the redemption of $1,906.3 million in Senior Notes due 2022, 2023 and 2025;•the repayment of $300.0 million of 5.0% Infomart Senior Notes according to the repayment terms;•dividend distributions of $836.2 million;•repayments of capital lease and other financing obligations totaling $126.5 million;•repayments of mortgage and loans payable totaling $73.2 million;•payments of debt extinguishment costs of $43.3 million, primarily related to redemption premium paid related to the redemption of Senior Notes due 2022, 2023 and 2025; and•payments of debt issuance costs of $23.3 million.57Table of ContentsNet cash provided by financing activities during 2018 was primarily due to:•the issuance of €750.0 million 2.875% Euro Senior Notes due 2024, or approximately $929.9 million in U.S. dollars, at the exchange rate in effect on March 14, 2018;•borrowing of the JPY Term Loan of ¥47.5 billion, or approximately $424.7 million at the exchange rate effective on July 31, 2018;•the sale of 930,934 shares under our ATM Program, for net proceeds of $388.2 million; and•proceeds from employee awards of $50.1 million.The proceeds were partially offset by:•dividend distributions of $738.6 million;•repayments of capital lease and other financing obligations of $103.8 million;•repayments of mortgage and loans payable of $447.5 million, primarily related to the prepayment of the remaining principal of our existing Japanese Yen Term Loan;•payments of debt extinguishment costs of $20.6 million; and•payments of debt issuance costs of $12.2 million.Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet ArrangementsWe lease a majority of our IBX data centers and certain equipment under long-term lease agreements.

Other contractual commitments are described below.(5) Represents liability, net of future accretion expense.In connection with certain of our leases and other contracts requiring deposits, we entered into 41 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $84.0 million under the revolving credit facility. These letters of credit were provided in lieu of cash deposits. If the landlords for these IBX leases decide to draw down on these letters of credit triggered by an event of default under the lease, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowing under the revolving credit facility. These contingent commitments are not reflected in the table above.We had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaling approximately $132.2 million as of December 31, 2019. These liabilities, which are reflected on our balance sheet, are not reflected in the table above since it is unclear when these liabilities will be paid.Primarily as a result of our various IBX data center expansion projects, as of December 31, 2019, we were contractually committed for $795.0 million of unaccrued capital expenditures, primarily for IBX equipment not yet delivered and labor not 58Table of Contentsyet provided in connection with the work necessary to complete construction and open these IBX data centers prior to making them available to customers for installation. This amount, which is expected to be paid during 2020 and thereafter, is reflected in the table above as ""other contractual commitments.""We had other non-capital purchase commitments in place as of December 31, 2019, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods, services or arrangements to be delivered or provided during 2020 and beyond. Such other purchase commitments as of December 31, 2019, which total $988.2 million, are also reflected in the table above as ""other contractual commitments.""In connection with the Joint Venture which closed in October 2019, we agreed to make future equity contributions to the Joint Venture of €17.6 million and £15.7 million, or $40.6 million in total at the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2019, to fund the Joint Venture’s future development over the next 3 years, which are not reflected in the table above. Additionally, we entered into lease agreements with various landlords primarily for data center spaces and ground leases which have not yet commenced as of December 31, 2019. These leases will commence between fiscal years 2020 and 2022, with lease terms of 10 to 49 years and total lease commitments of approximately $608.1 million, which are not reflected in the table above. Other Off-Balance-Sheet ArrangementsWe have various guarantor arrangements with both our directors and officers and third parties, including customers, vendors and business partners. As of December 31, 2019, there were no significant liabilities recorded for these arrangements. For additional information, see ""Guarantor Arrangements"" in Note 15 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.Concurrent with the closing of the Joint Venture, the Joint Venture entered into a credit agreement with a group of lenders for secured credit facilities of €850.0 million, or $953.7 million in total at the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2019, consisting of two secured term loan facilities and a secured revolving credit facility. The Joint Venture’s debt is secured by net assets of the Joint Venture, is without recourse to the partners, and does not represent a liability of the partners. We do not provide any guarantees to make principle payment to the lenders for the Joint Ventures’ indebtedness. Under the Joint Venture agreement, we and our joint venture partner GIC are also required to make additional equity contribution proportionately to the Joint Venture upon situations such as interest shortfall, cost-overrun or capital shortfall to complete certain construction phases. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following critical accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require significant judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain:•Accounting for income taxes;•Accounting for business combinations;•Accounting for impairment of goodwill; •Accounting for property, plant and equipment; and•Accounting for leases.59Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Income Taxes.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or settled. The accounting standard for income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined by the accounting standard as a likelihood of more than 50%) that such assets will not be realized.A tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authority's widely understood administrative practices and precedents. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax benefit (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future tax consequences. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. If, based on the weight of that available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified.This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account a number of types of evidence, including the following: 1) the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, 2) sources of future taxable income and 3) tax planning strategies.In assessing the tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position, the tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.For purposes of the quarterly REIT asset tests, we estimate the fair market value of assets within our QRSs and TRSs using a discounted cash flow approach, by calculating the present value of forecasted future cash flows. We apply discount rates based on industry benchmarks relative to the market and forecasting risks. Other significant assumptions used to estimate the fair market value of assets in QRSs and TRSs include projected revenue growth, projected operating margins and projected capital expenditure. We revisit significant assumptions periodically to reflect any changes due to business or economic environment. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had net total deferred tax liabilities of $211.4 million and $189.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had a total valuation allowance of $57.8 million and $57.0 million, respectively. If and when we reduce our remaining valuation allowances, it may have a favorable impact to our financial position and results of operations in the periods when such determinations are made. We will continue to assess the need for our valuation allowances, by jurisdiction, in the future. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we released the full valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets of one of our Brazilian legal entities due to the evidence of achieving sustainable profitability. For the Metronode Acquisition, we increased the valuation allowance that was assessed in prior year as a result of finalizing the provisional estimates related to the realizability of certain deferred tax assets. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we released the full or partial valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA regions. As part of the purchase accounting determination for the Metronode Acquisition, we provided full valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets in Australia that are not expected to be realizable in the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $173.7 million and $150.9 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the unrecognized tax benefit increased by $22.8 million primarily due to integrations, which was partially offset by the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits related to the Company’s tax positions in France as a result of a lapse in statutes of limitations and the partial payment of the Metronode pre-acquisition tax audit assessment which was fully indemnified by the seller. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the unrecognized tax benefits increased by $68.5 million primarily due to the Metronode Acquisition and the reorganization of the Spanish entities from the Itconic acquisition. The unrecognized tax benefits of $173.7 million as of December 31, 2019, if subsequently recognized, will affect our effective tax rate favorably at the time when such a benefit is recognized, of which $30.8 million is subject to an indemnification agreement.60Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Business CombinationsIn accordance with the accounting standard for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as customer contracts, leases and any other significant assets or liabilities and contingent consideration, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date if we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires assumptions and management's judgment to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Key judgments used to estimate the fair value of intangible assets include projected revenue growth and operating margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. During the last three years, we have completed a number of business combinations, including the acquisition of Switch Datacenters' AMS1 data center business in Amsterdam, Netherlands in April 2019, the Metronode Acquisition and the Infomart Dallas Acquisition in April 2018, the Itconic Acquisition and the Zenium data center acquisition in October 2017, the Verizon Data Center Acquisition in May 2017, and the IO Acquisition in February 2017. The purchase price allocation for these acquisitions has been finalized. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had net intangible assets of $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. We recorded amortization expense for intangible assets of $196.3 million, $203.4 million and $177.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we used to complete the purchase price allocations and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, which would be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in 2019 or beyond. 61Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsIn accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform goodwill and other intangible assets impairment reviews annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We complete the annual goodwill impairment assessment for the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific reporting units to determine if the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values. We perform a review of other intangible assets for impairment by assessing events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. To perform annual goodwill impairment assessment, we elected to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. This analysis requires assumptions and estimates before performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test, where the assessment requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. There were no specific factors present in 2019 or 2018 that indicated a potential goodwill impairment. We performed our annual review of other intangible assets by assessing if there were events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, such as a significant decrease in market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset or a continuous deterioration of our financial condition. This assessment requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. There were no specific events in 2019 or 2018 that indicated a potential impairment.As of December 31, 2019, goodwill attributable to the Americas, the EMEA and the Asia-Pacific reporting units was $1.7 billion, $2.4 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively.Future events, changing market conditions and any changes in key assumptions may result in an impairment charge. While we have not recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill to date, the development of adverse business conditions in our Americas, EMEA or Asia-Pacific reporting units, such as higher than anticipated customer churn or significantly increased operating costs, or significant deterioration of our market comparables that we use in the market approach, could result in an impairment charge in future periods.The balance of our other intangible assets, net, for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. While we have not recorded an impairment charge against our other intangible assets to date, future events or changes in circumstances, such as a significant decrease in market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate, may result in an impairment charge in future periods. Any potential impairment charge against our goodwill and other intangible assets would not exceed the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.62Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Property, Plant and EquipmentWe have a substantial amount of property, plant and equipment recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The vast majority of our property, plant and equipment represent the costs incurred to build out or acquire our IBX data centers. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets. We depreciate our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (subject to the term of the lease in the case of leased assets or leasehold improvements and integral equipment located in leased properties). Accounting for property, plant and equipment includes determining the appropriate period in which to depreciate such assets, assessing such assets for potential impairment, capitalizing interest during periods of construction and assessing the asset retirement obligations required for certain leased properties that require us to return the leased properties back to their original condition at the time we decide to exit a leased property.Judgments are required in arriving at the estimated useful life of an asset and changes to these estimates would have significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. When we lease a property for our IBX data centers, we generally enter into long-term arrangements with initial lease terms of at least 8-10 years and with renewal options generally available to us. In the next several years, a number of leases for our IBX data centers will come up for renewal. As we start approaching the end of these initial lease terms, we will need to reassess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment. In addition, we may find that our estimates for the useful lives of non-leased assets may also need to be revised periodically. We periodically review the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment and changes in these estimates in the future are possible. The assessment of long-lived assets for impairment requires assumptions and estimates of undiscounted and discounted future cash flows. These assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and are inherently uncertain.As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had property, plant and equipment of $12.2 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded depreciation expense of $1.1 billion, $1.0 billion, and $0.9 billion, respectively. While we evaluated the appropriateness, we did not revise the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Further changes in our estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment could have a significant impact on our results of operations.Accounting for LeasesA significant portion of our data center spaces, office spaces and equipment are leased. Each time we enter into a new lease or lease amendments, we analyze each lease or lease amendment for the proper accounting, including determining if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception and making assessment of the leased properties to determine if they are operating or finance leases. Determination of accounting treatment, including the result of the lease classification test for each new lease or lease amendment, is dependent on a variety of judgments, such as identification of lease and non-lease components, allocation of total consideration between lease and non-lease components, determination of lease term, including assessing the likelihood of lease renewals, valuation of leased property, and establishing the incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payment for the lease test. The judgments used in the accounting for leases are inherently subjective; different assumptions or estimates could result in different accounting treatment for a lease.As of December 31, 2019, we recorded operating lease right-of-use assets of $1.5 billion, finance lease assets of $1.3 billion, operating lease liabilities of $1.5 billion, and finance lease liabilities of $1.5 billion. Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded rent expense of approximately $219.0 million, $185.4 million and $157.9 million respectively.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee ""Recent Accounting Pronouncements"" in Note 1 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.63Table of ContentsITEM 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket Risk The following discussion about market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity.We employ foreign currency forward and option contracts, cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate locks for the purpose of hedging certain specifically-identified exposures. The use of these financial instruments is intended to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates, but does not eliminate such risks. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Investment Portfolio RiskWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities that is prioritized on meeting REIT asset requirements. All of our marketable securities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair values recognized in net income. We consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge for our securities, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. We anticipate that we will recover the entire cost basis of these securities and have determined that no other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were required to be recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019.As of December 31, 2019, our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market funds, certificates of deposits and publicly traded equity securities. The amount in our investment portfolio that could be susceptible to market risk totaled $896.9 million.Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our outstanding debt. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates from their position as of December 31, 2019 would not have a material impact on our interest expense due to the fixed coupon rate on the majority of our debt obligations. However, the interest expense associated with our senior credit facility and term loans, that bear interest at variable rates, could be affected. For every 100 basis point change in interest rates, our annual interest expense could increase by a total of approximately $11.5 million or decrease by a total of approximately $4.8 million based on the total balance of our primary borrowings under the Term Loan Facility as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding interest rate derivative hedges against our debt obligations. However, we may enter into interest rate hedging agreements in the future to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk.The fair value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate changes may affect the fair value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair value of our mortgage and loans payable and 5.000% Infomart Senior Notes, which are not traded in the market, is estimated by considering our credit rating, current rates available to us for debt of the same remaining maturities and the terms of the debt. The fair value of our other senior notes, which are traded in the market, was based on quoted market prices. The following table represents the carrying value and estimated fair value of our mortgage and loans payable and senior notes as of (in thousands): December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Carrying Value (1) Fair Value Carrying Value (1) Fair ValueMortgage and loans payable$1,370,118 $1,378,429 $1,388,524 $1,389,632Senior notes9,029,211 9,339,497 8,500,125 8,422,211 (1) The carrying value is gross of debt issuance cost, debt discount and debt premium.64Table of ContentsForeign Currency Risk A significant portion of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, however, approximately 58% of our revenues and 55% of our operating costs are attributable to Brazil, Canada, Colombia and the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions, and a large portion of those revenues and costs are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Australian dollar and Brazilian real. To help manage the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we have implemented a number of hedging programs, in particular:•a cash flow hedging program to hedge the forecasted revenues and expenses in our EMEA region;•a balance sheet hedging program to hedge the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies; and•a net investment hedging program to hedge the long term investments in our foreign subsidiaries. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of cash flows. We have entered into various foreign currency debt obligations. As of December 31, 2019, the total principal amount of foreign currency debt obligations was $4.4 billion, including $3.1 billion denominated in Euro, $604.3 million denominated in British Pound, $410.1 million denominated in Japanese Yen and $272.7 million denominated in Swedish Krona. As of December 31, 2019, we have designated $4.1 billion of the total principal amount of foreign currency debt obligations as net investment hedges against our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. For a net investment hedge, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument designated as a net investment hedge are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the U.S. Dollar will impact the amount of U.S. Dollars that we will require to settle the foreign currency debt obligations at maturity. If the U.S. Dollar would have been weaker or stronger by 10% in comparison to these foreign currencies as of December 31, 2019, we estimate our obligation to cash settle the principal of these foreign currency debt obligations in U.S. Dollars would have increased or decreased by approximately $485.9 million and $397.5 million, respectively. In 2019, we also entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps where we receive a fixed amount of U.S. Dollars and pay a fixed amount of Euros, with a total notional amount of $750.0 million. The cross-currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of our net investment in European operations and changes in the fair value of these swaps are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. If the U.S. Dollar weakened or strengthened by 10% in comparison to Euro, we would have recorded an additional loss of $93.1 million or gain of $76.2 million, respectively, within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2019. The U.S. Dollar strengthened relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate during the year ended December 31, 2019. This has impacted our condensed consolidated financial position and results of operations during this period, including the amount of revenues that we reported. Continued strengthening or weakening of the U.S. Dollar will continue to impact us in future periods. With the existing cash flow hedges in place, a hypothetical additional 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2019 would have resulted in a reduction of our revenues and operating expenses, including depreciation and amortization expenses, by approximately $153.7 million and $152.5 million, respectively.With the existing cash flow hedges in place, a hypothetical additional 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2019 would have resulted in an increase of our revenues and operating expenses, including depreciation and amortization expenses, by approximately $188.2 million and $188.4 million, respectively.We may enter into additional hedging activities in the future to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency risk as our exposure to foreign currency risk continues to increase due to our growing foreign operations; however, we do not currently intend to eliminate all foreign currency transaction exposure.65Table of ContentsCommodity Price RiskCertain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of price changes are electricity, supplies and equipment used in our IBX data centers. We closely monitor the cost of electricity at all of our locations. We have entered into several power contracts to purchase power at fixed prices in certain locations in the U.S., Switzerland, Italy, Sweden, Ireland, Bulgaria, Poland, Spain, Portugal, Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom.In addition, as we are building new, or expanding existing, IBX data centers, we are subject to commodity price risk for building materials related to the construction of these IBX data centers, such as steel and copper. In addition, the lead-time to procure certain pieces of equipment, such as generators, is substantial. Any delays in procuring the necessary pieces of equipment for the construction of our IBX data centers could delay the anticipated openings of these new IBX data centers and, as a result, increase the cost of these projects.We do not currently employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to address commodity price risk other than the power contracts discussed above.",2023-12-30 20:28:27.713859

For the discussion of 2018 items and 2019 results as compared to 2018 results, please refer to Item 7 of our 2019 Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on February 21, 2020.Our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist readers in understanding our financial information from our management's perspective and is presented as follows:•Overview•Results of Operations•Non-GAAP Financial Measures•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements•Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates•Recent Accounting PronouncementsOverview Equinix is a global digital infrastructure company, enabling digital leaders to harness a trusted platform to bring together and interconnect the foundational infrastructure that powers their success. Equinix enables today’s businesses to access all the right places, partners and possibilities they need to accelerate their advantage. Global enterprises, service providers and business ecosystems of industry partners rely on Equinix IBX data centers and 51Table of Contentsexpertise around the world for the safe housing of their critical IT equipment and to protect and connect the world's most valued information assets. They also look to Platform Equinix® for the ability to directly and securely interconnect to the networks, clouds and content that enable today's information-driven global digital economy. Recent Equinix IBX data center openings and acquisitions, as well as xScaleTM data center investments, have expanded our total global footprint to 227 IBXs, including two xScaleTM data centers and the MC1 data center that were held in unconsolidated joint ventures, across 63 markets around the world. Equinix offers the following solutions:•premium data center colocation;•interconnection and data exchange solutions;•edge services for deploying networking, security and hardware; and•remote expert support and professional services.Our interconnected data centers around the world allow our customers to increase information and application delivery performance to users, and quickly access distributed IT infrastructures and business and digital ecosystems, while significantly reducing costs. The Equinix global platform and the quality of our IBX data centers, interconnection offerings and edge services have enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. As more customers choose Platform Equinix, for bandwidth cost and performance reasons it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate in the same data centers. This adjacency creates a “network effect” that enables our customers to capture the full economic and performance benefits of our offerings. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a ""marketplace"" for their services. Our global platform enables scalable, reliable and cost-effective interconnection that increases data traffic exchange while lowering overall cost and increasing flexibility. Our focused business model is built on our critical mass of enterprise and service provider customers and the resulting ""marketplace"" effect. This global platform, combined with our strong financial position, continues to drive new customer growth and bookings.Historically, our market was served by large telecommunications carriers who have bundled their products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include private and vendor-neutral MTDC providers, hyperscale cloud providers, managed infrastructure and application hosting providers, and systems integrators. It is estimated that Equinix is one of more than 1,200 companies that provide MTDC offerings around the world. Each of these data center solutions providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings and outsourced IT infrastructure solutions. We are able to offer our customers a global platform that reaches 26 countries with the industry’s largest and most active ecosystem of partners in our sites, proven operational reliability, improved application performance and a highly scalable set of offerings.The cabinet utilization rate represents the percentage of cabinet space billed versus total cabinet capacity, which is used to measure how efficiently we are managing our cabinet capacity. Our cabinet utilization rate varies from market to market among our IBX data centers across the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. Our cabinet utilization rates were approximately 79%, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Excluding the impact of our IBX data center expansion projects that have opened during the last 12 months, our cabinet utilization rate would have increased to approximately 80% as of December 31, 2020. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain high power-demand customers. This increased power consumption has driven us to build out our new IBX data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX data centers. We could face power limitations in our IBX data centers, even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific IBX data center. This could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given IBX data center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, results of operations and cash flows.In 2019, we closed our EMEA Joint Venture with GIC to develop and operate xScaleTM data centers to serve the needs of the growing hyperscale data center market, including the world's largest cloud service providers. Upon closing, the EMEA Joint Venture acquired certain data center sites, including the London 10 data center, Paris 8 data center and few data center sites in London and Frankfurt, with the opportunity to add additional facilities in the future. In 2020, we sold the Paris 9 data center to the EMEA Joint Venture. In addition, we closed our Asia-Pacific Joint Venture with GIC in APAC to develop and operate xScaleTM data centers. Upon closing, the Asia-Pacific Joint 52Table of ContentsVenture acquired Osaka 2, Tokyo 12, and Tokyo 14 data center development sites in the APAC region, with the opportunity to add additional facilities in the future.Strategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and offerings. As was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors, including but not limited to demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, clouds and software partners, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, automation capabilities, developer talent pool, lead-time to break even on a free cash flow basis and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. Depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to Equinix standards. Property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant.Revenue:Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related interconnection and managed infrastructure offerings. We consider these offerings recurring because our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. In addition, during the past three years, more than 80% of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 3% of our recurring revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Our 50 largest customers accounted for approximately 39%, 39% and 38%, respectively, of our recurring revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer's initial deployment and professional services we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring because they are billed typically once, upon completion of the installation or the professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. However, revenues from installation services are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the contract term. Additionally, revenue from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is generally treated as a contract modification and recognized ratably over the remaining term of the contract, if any. As a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future. Operating Expenses:Cost of Revenues. The largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX data centers, utility costs, including electricity, bandwidth access, IBX data center employees' salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment and security. A majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, 53Table of Contentsunless we expand our existing IBX data centers or open or acquire new IBX data centers. However, there are certain costs that are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. We expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will generally increase in the future on a per-unit or fixed basis, in addition to the variable increase related to the growth in consumption by our customers. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months, as compared to other times of the year. To the extent we incur increased utility costs, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, to the extent we incur increased electricity or other costs as a result of either climate change policies or the physical effects of climate change, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Sales and Marketing. Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, amortization of contract costs, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer relationship intangible assets.General and Administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees, and other general corporate expenses, such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and some depreciation expense on back office systems.Taxation as a REIT We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 taxable year. As of December 31, 2020, our REIT structure included all of our data center operations in the U.S., Canada (with the exception of our data center in Ottawa), Mexico, Japan, Singapore and the data center operations in EMEA with the exception of Bulgaria, the United Arab Emirates, and the data center operations outside Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Our data center operations in other jurisdictions are operated as TRSs. We included our investment interest in the EMEA and Asia-Pacific Joint Ventures in our REIT structure.As a REIT, we generally are permitted to deduct from our U.S. federal taxable income the dividends we pay to our stockholders. The income represented by such dividends is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the entity level but is taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. Nevertheless, the income of our TRSs which hold our U.S. operations that may not be REIT compliant is subject to U.S. corporate federal and state income taxes, as applicable. Likewise, our foreign subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through TRSs or through QRSs. We are also subject to a separate U.S. federal corporate income tax on any gain recognized from a sale of a REIT asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a C corporation (such as an asset held by us or a QRS following the liquidation or other conversion of a former TRS). This built-in-gains tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a REIT asset to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a REIT asset. If we fail to remain qualified for U.S. federal income taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates. In addition, should we have net income from ""prohibited transactions,"" we will be subject to tax on this income at a 100% rate. ""Prohibited transactions,"" for this purpose, are defined as dispositions, at a gain, of inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business other than dispositions of foreclosure property and other than dispositions excepted by statutory safe harbors. Even if we remain qualified for U.S. federal income taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our TRSs' operations. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the U.S. federal income tax regime for REITs, many states do not completely follow federal rules, and some may not follow them at all.We continue to monitor our REIT compliance in order to maintain our qualification for U.S. federal income taxation as a REIT. For this and other reasons, as necessary, we may convert some of our data center operations in other countries into the REIT structure in future periods.On each of March 18, June 17, September 23, and December 9, 2020 we paid quarterly cash dividends of $2.66 per share. We expect the amount of our applicable dividends and other applicable distributions to equal or exceed the REIT taxable income that we recognized in 2020.54Table of ContentsThe Impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on Our Results and OperationsIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, emerged. In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the COVID-19 threat from high to very high, and in March 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a global pandemic. The global pandemic and the efforts implemented to address the pandemic, including the issuance of “shelter-in-place” orders and social distancing guidelines, have impacted major economic and financial markets globally.Many of our IBX data centers have been identified as ""essential businesses"" or ""critical infrastructure"" by local governments for purposes of remaining open during the COVID-19 pandemic. All of our IBX data centers remain operational at the time of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have activated our business continuity plans globally with the goal of providing seamless operations throughout our facilities, including provisions for ensuring all data centers remain staffed and fully operational and that our IBXs are equipped with the necessary equipment and supplies. We have implemented precautionary measures to minimize the risk of operational impact and to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners and communities. These include implementing tools such as an appointment-based system to control timing and frequency of visits while also encouraging our customers to leverage our IBX technicians via Smart Hands, our remote operational support service, in order to restrict visits and minimize the number of people and the amount of time spent in our IBX facilities. Most of our corporate offices remain closed as a result of the pandemic and we instructed our non-IBX employees in these offices to work from home until further notice. We have announced a phased plan for return-to-office for non-IBX attached sites and have been following this plan to open certain offices with occupancy limits as local conditions allow. Additionally, we have decided to continue to limit employee travel and postpone or virtualize global events in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.We are experiencing some construction delays, however, to date, the construction delays and additional costs are insignificant relative to the overall project duration and budget. Equipment for construction projects which are scheduled to be placed in the near future has been ordered, and is currently being manufactured or delivered with minimal delays. We are actively monitoring our vendors and suppliers to evaluate any anticipated changes in equipment availability or delivery timetables. We have redundancies built into our supply chain of vendors and, to the best of our ability, we keep a stock of critical items on site to ensure repairs can be completed. To date, we have not observed any significant disruption to our IBX data center operations due to supply chain impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our results of operations. The majority of our revenue is derived from large companies across a diverse set of industries. Customers operating in sectors more drastically impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as retail, travel, and energy, made up an insignificant percentage of our revenue. Smart Hands service revenues declined during the year ended December 31, 2020, as we waived Smart Hands service fees from the affected customers in certain circumstances during the first few months of the pandemic. We ceased to waive Smart Hands service fees for most customers as of June 30, 2020. We assessed realized and potential credit deterioration of our customers due to changes in the macroeconomic environment, considered the potential for payment term revision requests, and as a result, increased our allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable by an insignificant amount for the year ended December 31, 2020. We also incurred one-time cash bonuses and compensation expense of $8.6 million for our IBX employees as well as other employees to support their work-from-home requirements during the first quarter of 2020. We have experienced some travel expense savings during the year ended December 31, 2020 resulting from travel restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Looking ahead, the full impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our future financial condition or results of operations remains uncertain and will depend on a number of factors, including the duration and potential cyclicity of the health crisis and further public policy actions to be taken in response, as well as the continued impact of the pandemic on the global economy and our customers and vendors. Our past results may not be indicative of our future performance and historical trends may differ materially.For additional details regarding the risks to our business from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.2020 Highlights:•In January, we redeemed the remaining $343.7 million principal amount of the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2022. See Note 11 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.55Table of Contents•In January, we completed the acquisition of three data centers in Mexico from Axtel for a total purchase consideration of approximately $189.0 million. See Note 3 within the Consolidated Financial Statements. •In March, we completed the Packet Acquisition, a leading bare metal automation platform for a total purchase consideration of approximately $290.3 million. See Note 3 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In March, we borrowed a total of $250.0 million under our Revolving Facility, which was fully repaid in May. As of December 31, 2020, the amount available to borrow under the Revolving Facility was approximately $1.9 billion. See Note 11 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In April, we entered into a credit agreement which provided for senior unsecured 364-day term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million. On April 15, 2020, we borrowed $391.0 million, as well as €100.0 million or $109.8 million at the exchange rate in effect on that date. In May and June, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the 364-day term loan facilities. See Note 11 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In April, we entered into an agreement to form a second joint venture in the form of a limited liability partnership with GIC to develop and operate xScaleTM data centers in APAC. In the third quarter of 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $7.3 million, reducing the carrying value of the three Japan development sites to be sold, Osaka 2, Tokyo 12, and Tokyo 14, to the estimated fair value less cost to sell. On December 17, 2020, we closed the Asia-Pacific Joint Venture transaction which included the sale of the three development sites in exchange for $209.8 million of cash proceeds and $15.6 million of receivables. We recognized an insignificant gain on the sale of these xScaleTM data center facilities to the Asia-Pacific Joint Venture. See Note 5 and Note 6 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In May, we issued and sold 2,587,500 shares of common stock in a public offering for net proceeds of approximately $1,683.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.

See Note 11 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In August, we entered into an agreement to purchase the India operations of GPX Global Systems, Inc. (""GPX India""), representing two data centers in Mumbai, India, for approximately $161.0 million in an all-cash transaction (the “GPX India Acquisition”). The GPX India Acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approval. See Note 3 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of 13 data center sites in Canada, and their operations from Bell, for a total combined purchase consideration of approximately C$931.7 million, or $702.0 million at the exchange rates in effect on the transaction dates. See Note 3 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In October, we issued $1.85 billion in Senior Notes due in 2025, 2028 and 2051. On October 23, 2020, using a portion of the net proceeds, we redeemed all of our outstanding €1.0 billion aggregate principal amount 2.875% Senior Notes due 2025, as well as €0.5 billion of our outstanding €1.0 billion aggregate principal amount 2.875% Senior Notes due 2026. See Note 11 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In September, we entered into an agreement to sell the Paris 9 (""PA9"") data center to the EMEA Joint Venture.

The transaction was completed on December 15, 2020 for a total consideration of $131.5 million, which is comprised of net cash proceeds of $124.6 million, a contract asset with a fair value of $5.6 million and an insignificant amount of contingent consideration that is receivable upon completion of certain performance milestones. See Note 5 and Note 6 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•During 2020, we had sold 415,512 shares of our common stock for approximately $298.3 million in proceeds, net of payment of commissions and other offering expenses under the 2018 ATM Program, reaching the capacity of this program and subsequently closed. In October, we launched a new ATM program, under which we may offer and sell from time to time up to an aggregate of $1.5 billion of our common stock in ""at the market"" transactions (the ""2020 ATM Program""). As of December 31, 2020 we had not sold any shares under the 2020 ATM Program. See Note 12 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.56Table of ContentsResults of OperationsOur results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 include the results of operations from the acquisitions of 12 data center sites across Canada from Bell from October 1, 2020 and one additional data center acquired from Bell from November 2, 2020, Packet from March 2, 2020 and three data centers in Mexico from Axtel from January 8, 2020. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 include the results of operations from the acquisition of the AM11 data center from April 18, 2019 within the EMEA region.In order to provide a framework for assessing our performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we supplement the year-over-year actual change in results of operations with comparative changes on a constant currency basis. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further discussion. Years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions (dollars in thousands):Years Ended December 31,% Change2020%2019%ActualConstant CurrencyAmericas:Recurring revenues$2,582,800 43%$2,456,368 44%5%7%Non-recurring revenues124,958 2%131,359 3%(5)%(4)%2,707,758 45%2,587,727 47%5%6%EMEA:Recurring revenues1,864,720 31%1,680,746 30%11%12%Non-recurring revenues131,669 2%125,698 2%5%3%1,996,389 33%1,806,444 32%11%12%Asia-Pacific:Recurring revenues1,210,510 20%1,101,072 20%10%10%Non-recurring revenues83,888 2%66,897 1%25%24%1,294,398 22%1,167,969 21%11%10%Total:Recurring revenues5,658,030 94%5,238,186 94%8%9%Non-recurring revenues340,515 6%323,954 6%5%4%$5,998,545 100%$5,562,140 100%8%9%57Table of ContentsRevenues (dollars in thousands)Americas Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Americas revenue increased by 5% (6% on a constant currency basis). Growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to:•approximately $78.0 million of incremental revenues from the Bell, Packet, and Axtel acquisitions;•$21.0 million of incremental revenues generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions; and•an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period.The increase was partially offset by lower non-recurring revenues, primarily due to decreases in EIS products sales and lower revenues from Smart Hands products in 2020 as we restricted visits to our IBX facilities and waived certain Smart Hands service fees from the affected customers during the COVID-19 pandemic.EMEA Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2020, EMEA revenue increased by 11% (12% on a constant currency basis). Growth in EMEA revenues was primarily due to:•approximately $26.9 million of incremental revenues generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions; and•an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period.The increase was partially offset by:•a net decrease of $43.5 million of realized cash flow hedge gains from foreign currency forward contracts.Asia-Pacific Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Asia-Pacific revenue increased by 11% (10% on a constant currency basis). Growth in Asia-Pacific revenue was primarily due to:•approximately $19.8 million of incremental revenues generated from our recently-opened IBX data centers or IBX data center expansions;•higher non-recurring revenues, primarily due to increases in EIS products sales; and•an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period.58Table of ContentsCost of Revenues.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, Americas cost of revenues increased by 9% (11% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Americas cost of revenues was primarily due to:•approximately $64.4 million of incremental cost of revenues from the Bell, Packet, and Axtel acquisitions; •$9.8 million of higher utilities cost driven by IBX data center expansions and integration, primarily in U.S.;•$9.6 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation, primarily due to headcount growth and additional bonuses paid to IBX employees for supporting our business during the COVID-19 pandemic;•$7.9 million of higher property tax costs driven by IBX data center expansions;•$5.8 million of higher accretion and depreciation costs driven by IBX data center expansions; and•$5.2 million of higher consulting services and office expense, primarily due to project integration and additional spending on personal protective equipment for our IBX employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.EMEA Cost of Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2020, EMEA cost of revenues increased by 8% (and also 8% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to:•$42.8 million of higher depreciation expenses driven by IBX data center expansions in Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, United Arab Emirates, and France;•$25.9 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation, primarily due to headcount growth and additional bonuses to IBX employees for supporting our business during the COVID-19 pandemic;•$17.7 million of higher utilities costs driven by increased utility usage to support IBX data center expansions and utility price increases, primarily in Germany and France;59Table of Contents•$12.3 million of higher consulting services and office expense, primarily due to project integration and additional spending on personal protective equipment for our IBX employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; and•$9.4 million of higher rent and facilities costs and repairs and maintenance expense, primarily in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and the Netherlands.This increase was partially offset by:•$15.5 million decrease in realized cash flow hedge losses from foreign currency forward contracts;•$8.8 million of lower other expenses, as there was a general contractor bankruptcy during the year ended December 31, 2019, which resulted in incremental legal claim charges in the prior year; and•$8.3 million of net decrease in other cost of revenue, primarily due to lower costs related to decreased EIS revenues in Germany and the United Kingdom.Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Asia-Pacific cost of revenues increased by 13% (and also 13% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily due to:•$42.0 million of higher depreciation expense, primarily from IBX data center expansions in Australia, Singapore, Japan, and Hong Kong;•$14.6 million of higher utilities costs, primarily driven by expansions and higher utility usage in Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore;•$9.0 million of higher costs from increased EIS revenues, primarily in Japan;•$8.4 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation, primarily due to headcount growth and additional bonuses to IBX employees for supporting our business during the COVID-19 pandemic;•$6.6 million of higher taxes, licenses, and insurance, primarily driven by IBX data center expansions in Singapore, Australia, and Japan; and•$5.3 million of repairs and maintenance, primarily due to increases of maintenance projects in Japan and Australia. This increase was partially offset by:•$4.8 million of lower office, rent and facility expenses due to lower computer hardware costs and lower equipment lease activity in Japan.We expect Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific cost of revenues to increase in line with the growth of our business, including from the impacts of acquisitions.60Table of ContentsSales and Marketing Expenses.

The increase in our Americas sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to:•$42.9 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, salaries and stock-based compensation, partially due to additional compensation expenses incurred related to our recent acquisitions and headcount growth; •$10.6 million of higher advertising and promotions expenses primarily due to higher spending in online advertising, digital marketing strategies and digital consultancy;•$5.4 million of higher consulting services primarily due to higher fees and an increase in business deals; and•$5.1 million of higher amortization expenses related to customer relationship intangibles acquired from our recent acquisitions.This increase was partially offset by:•$6.4 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses resulting from travel restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.EMEA Sales and Marketing Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, EMEA sales and marketing increased by 3% (4% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to:•$16.1 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, salaries and stock-based compensation, partially due to additional compensation expenses incurred related to headcount growth.61Table of ContentsThis increase was partially offset by:•$4.7 million decrease in amortization expense driven by certain intangibles being fully amortized in the current year;•$4.1 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses resulting from travel restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; and•$2.7 million decrease of realized cash flow hedge losses from foreign currency forward contracts.Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Asia-Pacific sales and marketing increased by 7% (6% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to:•$9.8 million increase in compensation costs, including sales compensation, salaries and stock-based compensation and headcount growth.This increase was partially offset by:•$3.5 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenses resulting from travel restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.We anticipate that we will continue to invest in Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific sales and marketing initiatives and expect our Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expenses to increase in line with the growth of our business. We also expect travel and entertainment expenses to increase once travel restrictions that were imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are reduced. Additionally, given that certain global sales and marketing functions are located within the U.S., we expect Americas sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to be higher than our other regions.General and Administrative Expenses.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, Americas general and administrative expenses increased by 22% (23% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to:•$80.3 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation related to recent acquisitions and headcount growth;•$25.2 million of higher depreciation expense associated with the Axtel and Packet acquisitions and the implementation of certain systems to support the integration and growth of our business;•$20.2 million of higher consulting expenses in support of our business growth;•$16.9 million of higher office expenses due to additional computer software, hardware, and support services;•$4.6 million of higher third party services and other operating expenses due to higher project costs; and•$3.4 million of higher taxes, licenses, and insurance, primarily due to the Axtel and Packet acquisitions.This increase was partially offset by:•$12.1 million net decrease due to lower travel and entertainment expenses resulting from travel restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.EMEA General and Administrative Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, EMEA general and administrative expenses increased by 2% (3% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA general and administrative expenses was primarily due to:•$24.4 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, primarily due to headcount growth.This increase was partially offset by:•$6.0 million of lower travel and entertainment, resulting from travel restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic;•$5.5 million of lower other operating expenses, primarily due to the favorable determination of a legal claim;•$3.4 million of lower consulting expenses primarily related to lower accounting and tax fees; and•$3.2 million decrease of realized cash flow hedge losses from foreign currency forward contracts.Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses increased by 11% (and also 11% on a constant currency basis).

We also expect travel and entertainment expenses to increase once travel restrictions that were imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are reduced. Additionally, given that our corporate headquarters is located within the U.S., we expect Americas general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to continue to be higher than our other regions.Transaction Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded transaction costs totaling $55.9 million primarily related to costs incurred in connection with the acquisitions of Bell, Packet, and Axtel, as well as the costs incurred in connection with the formation of the Asia-Pacific Joint Venture. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded transaction costs totaling $24.8 million, primarily related to costs incurred in connection with the formation of the new EMEA Joint Venture.Impairment Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded impairment charges totaling $7.3 million in the Asia-Pacific region as a result of the fair value adjustment of the Asia-Pacific Joint venture xScaleTM data centers, which were classified as held for sale assets before they were sold on December 17, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairment charges totaling $15.8 million in the Americas region primarily as a result of the fair value adjustment for the New York 12 (""NY12"") data center, which was classified as a held for sale asset before it was sold in October 2019.Gain on Asset Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not record a significant amount of gain on asset sales. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded gain on asset sales of $44.3 million primarily relating to the sale of both the London 10 and Paris 8 data centers, as well as certain construction development and leases in London and Frankfurt, as part of the closing of the EMEA Joint Venture.Income from Operations.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, Americas income from operations decreased by 57% (54% on a constant currency basis). The decrease in our Americas income from operations was primarily due to higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues and higher transaction costs in connection with the recent acquisitions. Namely, a large increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by higher compensation costs and consulting expenses, which were in part related to recent acquisitions, higher office expenses and depreciation expense, and payments made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. EMEA Income from Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, EMEA income from operations increased by 26% (32% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA income from operations was 64Table of Contentsprimarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth, as described above, as well as lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Asia-Pacific Income from Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Asia-Pacific income from operations increased by 3% (5% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Asia-Pacific income from operations was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity, acquisition and organic growth as described above.Interest Income. Interest income was $8.7 million and $27.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 0.43% versus 1.85% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $406.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $479.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily attributable to the redemption of legacy high yield Senior Notes due 2022, 2024, 2025, and 2026, partially offset by the issuance of new Senior Notes due 2025, 2027, 2028, 2030, 2050 and 2051. Due to the issuance and redemption of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020, the effective interest rate decreased from December 31, 2019. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we capitalized $26.8 million and $32.2 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress.Other Income. We recorded net other income of $6.9 million and $27.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Other income is primarily comprised of foreign currency exchange gains and losses during the periods.Loss on Debt Extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $145.8 million of loss on debt extinguishment primarily related to the redemption of the Senior Notes due 2022, 2024, 2025, and 2026.During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $52.8 million of loss on debt extinguishment primarily related to the redemption of the Senior Notes due 2022, 2023 and 2025.Income Taxes We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income distributed to stockholders. We intend to distribute or have distributed the entire taxable income generated by the operations of our REIT and QRSs for the tax years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As such, other than tax attributable to built-in-gains recognized, state income taxes, and foreign income and withholding taxes, no provision for income taxes has been included for the REIT and its QRSs in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We have made TRS elections for some of our subsidiaries in and outside the U.S. In general, a TRS may provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs to provide and may hold assets that may not be REIT compliant.U.S. income taxes for the TRS entities located in the U.S. and foreign income taxes for our foreign operations regardless of whether the foreign operations are operated as QRSs or TRSs have been accrued, as necessary, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded $146.2 million and $185.4 million of income tax expenses, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 28.3% and 26.8%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a key factor in how we assess the operating performance of our segments and develop regional growth strategies such as IBX data center expansion decisions. We define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations excluding depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs and gain on asset sales. See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below for more information about adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to income or loss from operations. Our adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):65Table of ContentsYears Ended December 31,% Change2020%2019%ActualConstant CurrencyAmericas$1,186,022 42 %$1,237,622 46 %(4)%(3)%EMEA974,246 34 %827,980 31 %18 %19 %Asia-Pacific692,630 24 %622,125 23 %11 %11 %Total$2,852,898 100 %$2,687,727 100 %6 %7 %Americas Adjusted EBITDA. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Americas adjusted EBITDA decreased by 4% (3% on a constant currency basis). The decrease in our Americas adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to the increase in compensation expenses, consulting expenses and office expenses.EMEA Adjusted EBITDA. During the year ended December 31, 2020, EMEA adjusted EBITDA increased by 18% (19% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth, as described above.Asia-Pacific Adjusted EBITDA. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA increased by 11% (and also 11% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but we believe that evaluating our ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, we use non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operations. Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We have presented such non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our results of operations in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and ability to perform in subsequent periods. We believe that if we did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze Equinix effectively. Investors should note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by us may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. Investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing non-GAAP financial measures used by us to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. Our primary non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted funds from operations (""AFFO""), exclude depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of our IBX data centers and do not reflect our current or future cash spending levels to support our business. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of an IBX data center do not recur with respect to such data center, although we may incur initial construction costs in future periods with respect to additional IBX data centers, and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to our initial investment. This is a trend we expect to continue. In addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of our IBX data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs incurred to build out our IBX data centers and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. Therefore, we exclude depreciation from our results of operations when evaluating our operations. 66Table of ContentsIn addition, in presenting adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, we exclude amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense is significantly affected by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions and these charges may vary in amount from period to period. We exclude amortization expense to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our prior periods. We exclude accretion expense, both as it relates to asset retirement obligations as well as accrued restructuring charge liabilities, as these expenses represent costs which we believe are not meaningful in evaluating our current operations. We exclude stock-based compensation expense, as it can vary significantly from period to period based on share price, the timing, size and nature of equity awards. As such, we, and many investors and analysts, exclude stock-based compensation expense to compare our results of operations with those of other companies. We also exclude restructuring charges. The restructuring charges relate to our decisions to exit leases for excess space adjacent to several of our IBX data centers, which we did not intend to build out, or our decision to reverse such restructuring charges. We also exclude impairment charges related to certain long-lived assets. The impairment charges are related to expense recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets are not recoverable. We also exclude gain or loss on asset sales as it represents profit or loss that is not meaningful in evaluating the current or future operating performance. Finally, we exclude transaction costs from AFFO and adjusted EBITDA to allow more comparable comparisons of our financial results to our historical operations. The transaction costs relate to costs we incur in connection with business combinations and the formation of joint ventures, including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Such charges generally are not relevant to assessing the long-term performance of the company. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the transactions. Management believes items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, gain or loss on asset sales and transaction costs are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs may occur in future periods.Adjusted EBITDAThe following table shows the reconciliation from income from operations to adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):Years Ended December 31,202020192018Income from operations$1,052,928 $1,169,631 $977,383 Depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense1,427,010 1,285,296 1,226,741 Stock-based compensation expense311,020 236,539 180,716 Transaction costs55,935 24,781 34,413 Impairment charges7,306 15,790 — Gain on asset sales(1,301)(44,310)(6,013)Adjusted EBITDA$2,852,898 $2,687,727 $2,413,240 Our adjusted EBITDA results have improved each year in the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions in total dollars due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in ""Results of Operations"", as well as the nature of our business model consisting of a recurring revenue stream. The increases in adjusted EBITDA results for the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions were partially offset by the decrease in the AMER region, as noted above.Funds from Operations (""FFO"") and AFFOWe use FFO and AFFO, which are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in the REIT industry. FFO is calculated in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. FFO represents net income (loss), excluding gain (loss) from the disposition of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items.In presenting AFFO, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future operating performance. AFFO represents FFO excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate assets, accretion, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, a contract cost adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums, gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures, net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, and adjustments from FFO to AFFO for unconsolidated joint ventures' and noncontrolling interests' share of these items. The adjustments for installation revenue, straight-line rent expense and contract costs are intended to isolate the 67Table of Contentscash activity included within the straight-lined or amortized results in the consolidated statement of operations. We exclude the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings that have no current or future cash obligations. We exclude gain (loss) on debt extinguishment since it generally represents the write-off of initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings or a cost that is incurred to reduce future interest costs and is not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance. We include an income tax expense adjustment, which represents the non-cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes that do not relate to current period's operations. We deduct recurring capital expenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of its IBX data centers or other assets that are required to support current revenues. We also exclude net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, which represents results that may not recur and are not a good indicator of our current future operating performance.Our FFO and AFFO were as follows (in thousands): Years Ended December 31,202020192018Net income$370,074 $507,245 $365,359 Net gain (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests(297)205 — Net income attributable to Equinix369,777 507,450 365,359 Adjustments:Real estate depreciation924,064 845,798 883,118 (Gain) loss on disposition of real estate property4,063 (39,337)4,643 Adjustments for FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures2,726 645 — FFO$1,300,630 $1,314,556 $1,253,120 Years Ended December 31,202020192018FFO$1,300,630 $1,314,556 $1,253,120 Adjustments:Installation revenue adjustment(125)11,031 10,858 Straight-line rent expense adjustment10,787 8,167 7,203 Contract cost adjustment(35,675)(40,861)(20,358)Amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums15,739 13,042 13,618 Stock-based compensation expense311,020 236,539 180,716 Non-real estate depreciation expense300,258 242,761 140,955 Amortization expense199,047 196,278 203,416 Accretion expense (adjustment)3,641 459 (748)Recurring capital expenditures(160,637)(186,002)(203,053)Loss on debt extinguishment145,804 52,825 51,377 Transaction costs55,935 24,781 34,413 Impairment charges7,306 15,790 — Income tax expense adjustment33,220 39,676 (12,420)Adjustments for AFFO from unconsolidated joint ventures2,195 2,080 — AFFO$2,189,145 $1,931,122 $1,659,097 Our AFFO results have improved due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in ""Results of Operations,"" as well as due to the nature of our business model which consists of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature as discussed earlier in ""Overview.""68Table of ContentsConstant Currency PresentationOur revenues and certain operating expenses (cost of revenues, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses) from our international operations have represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues and certain operating expenses. As a result, our revenues and certain operating expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. dollar against major international currencies. During the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, the U.S. dollar was stronger relative to the Brazilian real, Singapore dollar and Australian dollar, which resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency impact on revenue, operating income and adjusted EBITDA, and a favorable foreign currency impact on operating expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, the U.S. dollar was weaker relative to the Japanese yen, Hong Kong dollar, Euro, and British pound, which resulted in a favorable foreign currency impact on revenue, operating income and adjusted EBITDA, and an unfavorable foreign currency impact on operating expenses. In order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present period-over-period percentage changes in our revenues and certain operating expenses on a constant currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. Our constant currency presentation excludes the impact of our foreign currency cash flow hedging activities. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, we have presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our results of operations. To present this information, our current period revenues and certain operating expenses from entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2019 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2020 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2020 with the year ended December 31, 2019). Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of December 31, 2020, our total indebtedness was comprised of debt and lease obligations totaling approximately $12.6 billion (gross of debt issuance cost, debt discount, plus mortgage premium) consisting of:•approximately $9.3 billion of principal from our senior notes;•approximately $1.9 billion from our finance lease liabilities; and •$1.4 billion of principal from our loans payable and mortgage.During 2020, we completed the following significant financing activities:•issued and sold 415,512 shares of common stock under our ATM Program, for proceeds of approximately $298.3 million, net of payment of commissions and other offering expenses;•issued and sold 2,587,500 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion;•borrowed and repaid $0.8 billion under our revolving credit facility and the 364-day term loan facilities; and •issued $4.4 billion of our Senior Notes, net of debt discounts, and repaid $4.1 billion of legacy high yield Senior Notes and $300.0 million of Infomart Senior Notes.As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. In addition to our cash and investment portfolio, we had $1.9 billion of additional liquidity available to us from our $2.0 billion revolving facility and general access to both public and private debt and the equity capital markets. We also have additional liquidity available to us from our ATM programs, under which we may offer and sell from time to time our common stock in ""at the market"" transactions. As of December 31, 2020, we had completed sales under the ATM program that was previously launched in December 2018. On October 30, 2020, we launched a new ATM program allowing for aggregate sales of up to $1.5 billion (the ""2020 ATM Program""). No sales have been made under the 2020 ATM Program to date.Besides any further financing activity we may pursue, customer collections are our primary source of cash. We believe we have a strong customer base, and have continued to experience relatively strong collections. We believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities and external financing sources, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of the current portion of our debt as it becomes due, distribution of dividends and completion of our publicly-announced acquisition and expansion projects. We also believe that our financial resources will allow us to manage future possible impact of the ongoing COVID-19 69Table of Contentspandemic on our business operations for the foreseeable future, which could include reductions in revenue and delays in payments from customers and partners. As we continue to grow, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build out of new IBX data centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as potential acquisitions and joint ventures. We may elect to access the equity or debt markets from time to time opportunistically, particularly if financing is available on attractive terms. We will continue to evaluate our operating requirements and financial resources in light of future developments, including those relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.Sources and Uses of CashYears Ended December 31,20202019(in thousands)Net cash provided by operating activities$2,309,826 $1,992,728 Net cash used in investing activities(3,426,972)(1,944,567)Net cash provided by financing activities815,526 1,202,082 Operating ActivitiesOur cash provided by our operations is generated by colocation, interconnection, managed infrastructure and other revenues. Our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include compensation and related costs, interest payments, other general corporate expenditures and taxes. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to improved results of operations offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses.Investing ActivitiesThe net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to capital expenditures of $2.3 billion as a result of our expansion activity, purchases of real estate of $200.2 million, business acquisitions of Bell, Packet and Axtel for $1.2 billion, and purchases of investments of $127.8 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets to the Asia-Pacific and EMEA Joint Ventures of $334.4 million and proceeds from sales of investments of $29.4 million. The net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to capital expenditures of $2.1 billion as a result of our expansion activity, purchases of real estate of $169.2 million, the AM11 data center acquisition of $34.1 million, and purchases of investments of $60.9 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets, primarily due to the sale of assets to the EMEA Joint Venture, of $358.8 million and proceeds from sales of investments of $40.4 million.We anticipate our IBX data center expansion construction activity will be similar or increase from our 2020 levels. If the opportunity to expand is greater than planned and we have sufficient funding to pursue such expansion opportunities, we may further increase the level of capital expenditure to support this growth as well as pursue additional business and real estate acquisitions or joint ventures.Financing ActivitiesNet cash provided by financing activities during 2020 was primarily due to:•the issuance of $4.4 billion in Senior Notes due 2025, 2027, 2028, 2030, 2050 and 2051;•the sale and issuance of 2,587,500 shares of common stock in a public offering for net proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses; •borrowings under the revolving credit facility of $250.0 million and the 364-Day term loan facilities of $500.8 million;•the sale of 415,512 shares of common stock under the ATM Program, for net proceeds of $298.3 million; and•proceeds from employee awards of $62.1 million.The proceeds were partially offset by:70Table of Contents•the redemption of $4.1 billion in Senior Notes due 2022, 2024, 2025 and 2026;•the repayment of $300.0 million of 5.0% Infomart Senior Notes according to the repayment terms;•dividend distributions of $947.9 million;•repayments of finance lease liabilities totaling $115.3 million;•repayments of mortgage and loans payable totaling $829.5 million, primarily from the repayments of the revolving credit facility and the 364-Day term loan facilities;•payments of debt extinguishment costs of $111.7 million, primarily related to redemption premium paid to redeem legacy high yield Senior Notes due 2022, 2024, 2025 and 2026; and•payments of debt issuance costs of $42.2 million.Net cash provided by financing activities during 2019 was primarily due to:•the issuance of $2.8 billion in Senior Notes due 2024, 2026 and 2029;•the sale and issuance of 2,985,575 shares of common stock in a public equity offering and receipt of net proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses;•the sale of 903,555 shares under our ATM Program, for net proceeds of $447.5 million; and•proceeds from employee awards of $52.0 million.The proceeds were partially offset by:•the redemption of $1.9 billion in Senior Notes due 2022, 2023 and 2025;•the repayment of $300.0 million of 5.0% Infomart Senior Notes according to the repayment terms;•dividend distributions of $836.2 million;•repayments of finance lease liabilities of $126.5 million;•repayments of mortgage and loans payable of $73.2 million;•payments of debt extinguishment costs of $43.3 million, primarily related to redemption premium paid to redeem Senior Notes due 2022, 2023 and 2025; and•payments of debt issuance costs of $23.3 million.Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance-Sheet ArrangementsWe lease a majority of our IBX data centers and certain equipment under long-term lease agreements.

This amount, which is expected to be paid during 2021 and thereafter, is reflected in the table above as ""other contractual commitments.""We had other non-capital purchase commitments in place as of December 31, 2020, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods, services or arrangements to be delivered or provided during 2021 and beyond. Such other purchase commitments as of December 31, 2020, which total $1.3 billion, are also reflected in the table above as ""other contractual commitments.""Other commitmentsIn connection with certain of our leases and other contracts requiring deposits, we entered into 37 irrevocable letters of credit totaling $74.6 million under the revolving credit facility. These letters of credit were provided in lieu of cash deposits. If the landlords for these IBX leases decide to draw down on these letters of credit triggered by an event of default under the lease, we will be required to fund these letters of credit either through cash collateral or borrowing under the revolving credit facility. These contingent commitments are not reflected in the table above.We had accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaling approximately $169.7 million as of December 31, 2020. These liabilities, which are reflected on our balance sheet, are not reflected in the table above since it is unclear when these liabilities will be paid.In connection with the EMEA Joint Venture which closed in October 2019, we committed to make future equity contributions to the EMEA Joint Venture of €13.8 million and £6.6 million, or $25.8 million in total at the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2020, to fund the EMEA Joint Venture’s future development until 2022, which are not reflected in the table above. In connection with the sale of the PA9 data center, which closed in December 2020, we also has a commitment to the EMEA Joint Venture to complete a residual portion of the PA9 center for an estimated cost of €14.5 million or $17.7 million in total at the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2020, which is reimbursable upon completion and is not reflected in the table above.We also committed to make future equity contributions to the Asia-Pacific Joint Venture, which was closed on December 17, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had future equity contribution commitments of ¥6.3 billion, or $60.7 million in total at the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2020, which is not reflected in the table above.Additionally, we entered into lease agreements with various landlords primarily for data center spaces and ground leases which have not yet commenced as of December 31, 2020. These leases will commence between fiscal years 2021 and 2022 with lease terms of 10 to 49 years and a total lease commitment of approximately $684.1 million, which is not reflected in the table above. Other Off-Balance-Sheet ArrangementsWe have various guarantor arrangements with both our directors and officers and third parties, including customers, vendors and business partners. As of December 31, 2020, there were no significant liabilities recorded for these arrangements. For additional information, see ""Guarantor Arrangements"" in Note 15 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its 72Table of Contentsassumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require significant judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain:• Accounting for income taxes;• Accounting for business combinations;• Accounting for impairment of goodwill; • Accounting for property, plant and equipment; and• Accounting for leases.73Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Income Taxes.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and tax attributes such as operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or settled. The accounting standard for income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined by the accounting standard as a likelihood of more than 50%) that such assets will not be realized.A tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authority's widely understood administrative practices and precedents. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax benefit (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future tax consequences. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. If, based on the weight of that available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified.This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account a number of types of evidence, including the following: 1) the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, 2) sources of future taxable income and 3) tax planning strategies.In assessing the tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position, the tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.For purposes of the quarterly REIT asset tests, we estimate the fair market value of assets within our QRSs and TRSs using a discounted cash flow approach, by calculating the present value of forecasted future cash flows. We apply discount rates based on industry benchmarks relative to the market and forecasting risks. Other significant assumptions used to estimate the fair market value of assets in QRSs and TRSs include projected revenue growth, projected operating margins and projected capital expenditure. We revisit significant assumptions periodically to reflect any changes due to business or economic environment.As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had net total deferred tax liabilities of $224.0 million and $211.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had a total valuation allowance of $82.3 million and $57.8 million, respectively. If and when we increase or reduce our valuation allowances, it may have an unfavorable or favorable impact, respectively, to our financial position and results of operations in the periods when such determinations are made. We will continue to assess the need for our valuation allowances, by jurisdiction, in the future. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we provided full valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets acquired in Canada and the Netherlands that are not expected to be realizable in the foreseeable future. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we released the full valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets of one of our Brazilian legal entities due to the evidence of achieving sustainable profitability. For the Metronode Acquisition, we increased the valuation allowance that was assessed in prior year as a result of finalizing the provisional estimates related to the realizability of certain deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $207.8 million and $173.7 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the unrecognized tax benefit increased by $34.1 million primarily due to integrations in the EMEA region, which was partially offset by the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits related to our tax positions in a few countries as a result of a lapse in statutes of limitations and the partial payment related to the UK integration. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the unrecognized tax benefit increased by $22.8 million primarily due to integrations, which was partially offset by the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits related to our tax positions in France as a result of a lapse in statutes of limitations and the partial payment of the Metronode pre-acquisition tax audit assessment which was fully indemnified by the seller. The unrecognized tax benefits of $207.8 million as of December 31, 2020, of which $33.8 million is subject to an indemnification agreement, if subsequently recognized, will affect our effective tax rate favorably at the time when such a benefit is recognized.74Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Business CombinationsIn accordance with the accounting standard for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as customer contracts, leases and any other significant assets or liabilities and contingent consideration, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date if we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires assumptions and management's judgment to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Key judgments used to estimate the fair value of intangible assets include projected revenue growth and operating margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. During the last three years, we have completed a number of business combinations, including the acquisition of Bell Data Centers in Canada in the fourth quarter of 2020, Packet in March 2020, Axtel in Mexico in January 2020, Switch Datacenters' AMS1 data center business in Amsterdam, Netherlands in April 2019, and the Metronode Acquisition and the Infomart Dallas Acquisition in April 2018. The purchase price allocation for these acquisitions has been finalized, except for the Bell acquisition.As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had net intangible assets of $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. We recorded amortization expense for intangible assets of $199.0 million, $196.3 million and $203.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we used to complete the purchase price allocations and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, which would be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in 2020 or beyond. 75Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsIn accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform goodwill and other intangible assets impairment reviews annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We complete the annual goodwill impairment assessment for the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific reporting units to determine if the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values. We perform a review of other intangible assets for impairment by assessing events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. To perform annual goodwill impairment assessment, we elected to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. This analysis requires assumptions and estimates before performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test, where the assessment requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. Additionally, we periodically review our assessment of our reporting units to determine if changes in facts and circumstances warrant changes to our conclusions. There were no specific factors present in 2020 or 2019 that indicated a potential goodwill impairment. We performed our annual review of other intangible assets by assessing if there were events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, such as a significant decrease in market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset or a continuous deterioration of our financial condition. This assessment requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. There were no specific events in 2020 or 2019 that indicated a potential impairment.As of December 31, 2020, goodwill attributable to the Americas, the EMEA and the Asia-Pacific reporting units was $2.2 billion, $2.6 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively.Future events, changing market conditions and any changes in key assumptions may result in an impairment charge. While we have not recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill to date, the development of adverse business conditions in our Americas, EMEA or Asia-Pacific reporting units, such as higher than anticipated customer churn or significantly increased operating costs, or significant deterioration of our market comparables that we use in the market approach, could result in an impairment charge in future periods.The balance of our other intangible assets, net, for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. While we have not recorded an impairment charge against our other intangible assets to date, future events or changes in circumstances, such as a significant decrease in market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate, may result in an impairment charge in future periods. Any potential impairment charge against our goodwill and other intangible assets would not exceed the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.76Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Property, Plant and EquipmentWe have a substantial amount of property, plant and equipment recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The vast majority of our property, plant and equipment represent the costs incurred to build out or acquire our IBX data centers. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets. We depreciate our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (subject to the term of the lease in the case of leased assets or leasehold improvements and integral equipment located in leased properties). Accounting for property, plant and equipment includes determining the appropriate period in which to depreciate such assets, assessing such assets for potential impairment, capitalizing interest during periods of construction and assessing the asset retirement obligations required for certain leased properties that require us to return the leased properties back to their original condition at the time we decide to exit a leased property.Judgments are required in arriving at the estimated useful life of an asset and changes to these estimates would have significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. When we lease a property for our IBX data centers, we generally enter into long-term arrangements with initial lease terms of at least 8-10 years and with renewal options generally available to us. In the next several years, a number of leases for our IBX data centers will come up for renewal. As we start approaching the end of these initial lease terms, we will need to reassess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment. In addition, we may find that our estimates for the useful lives of non-leased assets may also need to be revised periodically. We periodically review the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment and changes in these estimates in the future are possible. The assessment of long-lived assets for impairment requires assumptions and estimates of undiscounted and discounted future cash flows. These assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and are inherently uncertain.As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had property, plant and equipment of $14.5 billion and $12.2 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded depreciation expense of $1.2 billion, $1.1 billion, and $1.0 billion, respectively. While we evaluated the appropriateness, we did not revise the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Further changes in our estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment could have a significant impact on our results of operations.Accounting for LeasesA significant portion of our data center spaces, office spaces and equipment are leased. Each time we enter into a new lease or lease amendments, we analyze each lease or lease amendment for the proper accounting, including determining if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception and making assessment of the leased properties to determine if they are operating or finance leases. Determination of accounting treatment, including the result of the lease classification test for each new lease or lease amendment, is dependent on a variety of judgments, such as identification of lease and non-lease components, allocation of total consideration between lease and non-lease components, determination of lease term, including assessing the likelihood of lease renewals, valuation of leased property, and establishing the incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payment for the lease test. The judgments used in the accounting for leases are inherently subjective; different assumptions or estimates could result in different accounting treatment for a lease.Lease assumptions and estimates are determined and applied at the inception of the leases or at the lease modification date. As of both December 31, 2020 and 2019, operating right-of-use (""ROU"") lease assets were at $1.5 billion and operating lease liabilities were at $1.5 billion . As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, finance ROU assets were $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, and finance lease liabilities were $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded the finance lease cost of $233.9 million and $193.6 million, respectively, and recorded rent expense of approximately $217.3 million, $219.0 million and $185.4 million, respectively.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee ""Recent Accounting Pronouncements"" in Note 1 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.77Table of ContentsITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket Risk The following discussion about market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity.The uncertainty that exists with respect to the economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic introduced significant volatility in the financial markets. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding potential risks to our business, financial condition and results of operations related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.We employ foreign currency forward and option contracts, cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate locks for the purpose of hedging certain specifically identified exposures. The use of these financial instruments is intended to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates, but does not eliminate such risks. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Investment Portfolio RiskWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities that is prioritized on meeting REIT asset requirements. All of our marketable securities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair values recognized in net income. We consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge for our securities, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. We anticipate that we will recover the entire cost basis of these securities and have determined that no other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were required to be recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020.As of December 31, 2020, our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market funds, certificates of deposits and publicly traded equity securities. The amount in our investment portfolio that could be susceptible to market risk totaled $615.6 million.Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our outstanding debt. An immediate 10% increase or decrease in current interest rates from their position as of December 31, 2020 would not have a material impact on our interest expense due to the fixed coupon rate on the majority of our debt obligations. However, the interest expense associated with our senior credit facility and term loans, that bear interest at variable rates, could be affected. For every 100 basis point change in interest rates, our annual interest expense could increase by a total of approximately $10.9 million or decrease by a total of approximately $0.2 million based on the total balance of our primary borrowings under the Term Loan Facility as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding interest rate derivative hedges against our debt obligations. However, we may enter into interest rate hedging agreements in the future to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk.The fair value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate changes may affect the fair value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair value of our mortgage and loans payable and 5.000% Infomart Senior Notes, which are not traded in the market, is estimated by considering our credit rating, current rates available to us for debt of the same remaining maturities and the terms of the debt. The fair value of our other senior notes, which are traded in the market, was based on quoted market prices. The following table represents the carrying value and estimated fair value of our mortgage and loans payable and senior notes as of (in thousands):78Table of ContentsDecember 31, 2020December 31, 2019Carrying Value (1)Fair ValueCarrying Value (1)Fair ValueMortgage and loans payable$1,370,970 $1,379,129 $1,370,118 $1,378,429 Senior notes9,261,050 9,705,486 9,029,211 9,339,497 (1)The carrying value is gross of debt issuance cost, debt discount and debt premium.Foreign Currency Risk A significant portion of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, however, approximately 59% of our revenues and 53% of our operating costs are attributable to Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Colombia and the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions, and a large portion of those revenues and costs are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Australian dollar and Brazilian real. To help manage the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we have implemented a number of hedging programs, in particular:•a cash flow hedging program to hedge the forecasted revenues and expenses in our EMEA region;•a balance sheet hedging program to hedge the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies; and•a net investment hedging program to hedge the long term investments in our foreign subsidiaries. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of cash flows. We have entered into various foreign currency debt obligations. As of December 31, 2020, the total principal amount of foreign currency debt obligations was $1.9 billion, including $611.1 million denominated in Euro, $589.7 million denominated in British Pound, $408.5 million denominated in Japanese Yen and $293.9 million denominated in Swedish Krona. As of December 31, 2020, we have designated $1.9 billion of the total principal amount of foreign currency debt obligations as net investment hedges against our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. For a net investment hedge, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument designated as a net investment hedge are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the U.S. Dollar will impact the amount of U.S. Dollars that we will require to settle the foreign currency debt obligations at maturity. If the U.S. Dollar would have been weaker or stronger by 10% in comparison to these foreign currencies as of December 31, 2020, we estimate our obligation to cash settle the principal of these foreign currency debt obligations in U.S. Dollars would have increased or decreased by approximately $211.5 million and $173.0 million, respectively. We also entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps where we receive a fixed amount of U.S. Dollars and pay a fixed amount of Euros. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total notional amounts of U.S. Dollar to Euro cross-currency interest rate swap contracts were $3.3 billion and $750.0 million, respectively. The cross-currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of our net investment in European operations and changes in the fair value of these swaps are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheet. If the U.S. Dollar weakened or strengthened by 10% in comparison to Euro, we would have recorded an additional loss of $409.6 million or gain of $337.3 million, respectively, within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2020. The U.S. Dollar weakened relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate during the year ended December 31, 2020. This has impacted our consolidated financial position and results of operations during this period, including the amount of revenues that we reported. Continued strengthening or weakening of the U.S. Dollar will continue to impact us in future periods. With the existing cash flow hedges in place, a hypothetical additional 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2020 would have resulted in a reduction of our revenues and operating expenses, including depreciation and amortization expenses, by approximately $171.1 million and $169.7 million, respectively.79Table of ContentsWith the existing cash flow hedges in place, a hypothetical additional 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2020 would have resulted in an increase of our revenues and operating expenses, including depreciation and amortization expenses, by approximately $209.2 million and $207.4 million, respectively.We may enter into additional hedging activities in the future to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency risk as our exposure to foreign currency risk continues to increase due to our growing foreign operations; however, we do not currently intend to eliminate all foreign currency transaction exposure.Commodity Price RiskCertain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of price changes are electricity, supplies and equipment used in our IBX data centers. We closely monitor the cost of electricity at all of our locations. We have entered into several power contracts to purchase power at fixed prices in certain locations in the Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the U.S..In addition, as we are building new, or expanding existing, IBX data centers, we are subject to commodity price risk for building materials related to the construction of these IBX data centers, such as steel and copper. In addition, the lead-time to procure certain pieces of equipment, such as generators, is substantial. Any delays in procuring the necessary pieces of equipment for the construction of our IBX data centers could delay the anticipated openings of these new IBX data centers and, as a result, increase the cost of these projects.We do not currently employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to address commodity price risk other than the power contracts discussed above.",2023-12-30 20:28:08.665856

All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.Item 7 of this Form 10-K focuses on discussion of 2021 and 2020 items as well as 2021 results as compared to 2020 results. For the discussion of 2019 items and 2020 results as compared to 2019 results, please refer to Item 7 of our 2020 Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on February 19, 2021.Our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist readers in understanding our financial information from our management's perspective and is presented as follows:•Overview•Results of Operations•Non-GAAP Financial Measures•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates•Recent Accounting PronouncementsOverview We provide a global, vendor-neutral data center, interconnection and edge services platform with offerings that aim to enable our customers to reach everywhere, interconnect everyone and integrate everything. Global enterprises, service providers and business ecosystems of industry partners rely on our IBX data centers and expertise around the world for the safe housing of their critical IT equipment and to protect and connect the world's most valued information assets. They also look to Platform Equinix® for the ability to directly and securely 51Table of Contentsinterconnect to the networks, clouds and content that enable today's information-driven global digital economy. Our recent IBX data center openings and acquisitions, as well as xScaleTM data center investments, have expanded our total global footprint to 240 data centers, including eight xScale data centers and the MC1 data center that were held in unconsolidated joint ventures, across 66 markets around the world. Metrics also include the MU4 and GN1 data centers which opened in January 2022. Equinix offers the following solutions:•premium data center colocation;•interconnection and data exchange solutions;•edge services for deploying networking, security and hardware; and•remote expert support and professional services.Our interconnected data centers around the world allow our customers to increase information and application delivery performance to users, and quickly access distributed IT infrastructures and business and digital ecosystems, while significantly reducing costs. Our global platform and the quality of our IBX data centers, interconnection offerings and edge services have enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. As more customers choose Platform Equinix for bandwidth cost and performance reasons, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate in the same data centers. This adjacency creates a “network effect” that enables our customers to capture the full economic and performance benefits of our offerings. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a ""marketplace"" for their services. Our global platform enables scalable, reliable and cost-effective interconnection that increases data traffic exchange while lowering overall cost and increasing flexibility. Our focused business model is built on our critical mass of enterprise and service provider customers and the resulting ""marketplace"" effect. This global platform, combined with our strong financial position, has driven new customer growth and bookings.Historically, our market was served by large telecommunications carriers who bundled their products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include private and vendor-neutral multi-tenant data center (""MTDC"") providers, hyperscale cloud providers, managed infrastructure and application hosting providers, and systems integrators. It is estimated that Equinix is one of more than 2,200 companies that provide MTDC offerings around the world. Each of these data center solutions providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings and outsourced IT infrastructure solutions. We are able to offer our customers a global platform that reaches 27 countries with the industry’s largest and most active ecosystem of partners in our sites, proven operational reliability, improved application performance and a highly scalable set of offerings.The cabinet utilization rate represents the percentage of cabinet space billed versus total cabinet capacity, which is used to measure how efficiently we are managing our cabinet capacity. Our cabinet utilization rate varies from market to market among our IBX data centers across our Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. Our cabinet utilization rates were approximately 79%, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Excluding the impact of our IBX data center expansion projects that have opened during the last 12 months, our cabinet utilization rate would have increased to approximately 81% as of December 31, 2021. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain high power-demand customers. This increased power consumption has driven us to build out our new IBX data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX data centers. We could face power limitations in our IBX data centers, even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific IBX data center. This could have a negative impact on the available utilization capacity of a given IBX data center, which could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, results of operations and cash flows.To serve the needs of the growing hyperscale data center market, including the world's largest cloud service providers, we have entered into joint ventures to develop and operate xScale data centers. In the past two years, we entered into our EMEA 1 Joint Venture, Asia-Pacific 1 Joint Venture and EMEA 2 Joint Venture, and entered into negotiations in connection with a new joint venture (the ""AMER 1 Joint Venture""), in the form of limited liability partnerships with GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund (""GIC""). In October 2021, we entered into an agreement to form an additional joint venture in the form of a limited liability partnership with PGIM Real Estate, to further expand our xScale data center portfolio in Asia-Pacific (the ""Asia-Pacific 2 Joint Venture""). See Note 5 within the Consolidated Financial Statements. 52Table of ContentsStrategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and offerings. As was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors, including but not limited to demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, clouds and software partners, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, automation capabilities, developer talent pool, lead-time to break even on a free cash flow basis and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. Depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to our standards. Property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant.Revenue:Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related interconnection and managed infrastructure offerings. We consider these offerings recurring because our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length. Our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. In addition, during the past three years, more than 80% of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 3% of our recurring revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Our 50 largest customers accounted for approximately 39% of our recurring revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.Our non-recurring revenues are primarily comprised of installation services related to a customer's initial deployment and professional services we perform, as well as equipment sales. These services are considered to be non-recurring because they are billed typically once, upon completion of the installation or the professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. However, revenues from installation services are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the contract term. Additionally, revenue from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is generally treated as a contract modification and recognized ratably over the remaining term of the contract, if any. As a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future. Operating Expenses:Cost of Revenues. The largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX data centers, utility costs, including electricity, bandwidth access, IBX data center employees' salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment and security. A majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing IBX data centers or open or acquire new IBX data centers. However, there are certain costs that are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. We expect the cost of our utilities, specifically electricity, will generally increase in the future on a per-unit or fixed basis, in addition to the variable increase related to the growth 53Table of Contentsin consumption by our customers. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months, as compared to other times of the year. Our costs of electricity may also increase as a result of the physical effects of climate change, increased regulations driving alternative electricity generation due to environmental considerations or as a result of our election to use renewable energy sources. To the extent we incur increased utility costs, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Sales and Marketing. Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, amortization of contract costs, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer relationship intangible assets.General and Administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation; accounting, legal and other professional service fees; and other general corporate expenses, such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and some depreciation expense on back office systems.Taxation as a REIT We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our 2015 taxable year. As of December 31, 2021, our REIT structure included all of our data center operations in the U.S., Canada (with the exception of one data center in Montreal), Mexico, Japan, Singapore and the majority of our data centers in EMEA. Our data center operations in other jurisdictions are operated as TRSs. We included our share of the assets in the EMEA and Asia-Pacific Joint Ventures in our REIT structure.As a REIT, we generally are permitted to deduct from our U.S. federal taxable income the dividends we pay to our stockholders. The income represented by such dividends is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the entity level but is taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. Nevertheless, the income of our TRSs which hold our U.S. operations that may not be REIT compliant is subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income taxes, as applicable. Likewise, our foreign subsidiaries continue to be subject to local income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through TRSs or through QRSs. We are also subject to a separate U.S. federal corporate income tax on any gain recognized from a sale of a REIT asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a C corporation (such as an asset held by us or a QRS following the liquidation or other conversion of a former TRS). This built-in-gains tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a REIT asset to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a REIT asset. In addition, should we have net income from ""prohibited transactions,"" we will be subject to tax on this income at a 100% rate. ""Prohibited transactions,"" for this purpose, are defined as dispositions, at a gain, of inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business other than dispositions of foreclosure property and other than dispositions excepted by statutory safe harbors. If we fail to remain qualified for U.S. federal income taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates. Even if we remain qualified for U.S. federal income taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our TRSs' operations. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the U.S. federal income tax regime for REITs, many states do not completely follow federal rules, and some may not follow them at all.We continue to monitor our REIT compliance in order to maintain our qualification for U.S. federal income taxation as a REIT. For this and other reasons, as necessary, we may convert some of our data center operations in other countries into the REIT structure in future periods.On each of March 17, June 16, September 22, and December 15, 2021 we paid quarterly cash dividends of $2.87 per share. We expect the amount of our applicable dividends and other applicable distributions to equal or exceed the REIT taxable income that we recognized in 2021.The Impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on Our Results and OperationsWe have continued to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our people and business. All of our IBX data centers have remained, and continue to remain, operational at the time of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have begun a phased plan for return-to-office for most of our non-IBX attached sites on a voluntary basis in accordance with guidance provided by government agencies. Non-essential business travel 54Table of Contentsremains limited, and while we continue to hold virtual events, we have also resumed certain in-person events as local travel restrictions allow.While we are experiencing some construction delays, including those due to supply chain impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, to date, the construction delays and additional costs are insignificant relative to the overall project duration and budget. We have not observed any significant disruption to our IBX data center operations. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our results of operations. We incurred one-time cash bonuses and compensation expense of $8.6 million for our IBX employees as well as other employees to support their work-from-home requirements during the first quarter of 2020. We have also experienced some travel expense savings during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 resulting from travel restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Looking ahead, the full impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our future financial condition or results of operations remains uncertain and will depend on a number of factors, including the duration and potential cyclicity of the health crisis and further public policy actions to be taken in response, as well as the continued impact of the pandemic on the global economy and our customers and vendors. Our past results may not be indicative of our future performance and historical trends may differ materially.For additional details regarding the risks to our business from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.2021 Highlights:•In March, we issued €1.1 billion in Senior Notes due 2027 and 2033, or approximately $1.3 billion in U.S. dollars, at the exchange rate in effect on March 10, 2021. Using a portion of the proceeds, we redeemed all of the remaining outstanding 2.875% Euro Senior Notes due 2026 for approximately $590.7 million in U.S. dollars, at the exchange rate in effect on March 24, 2021. See Note 11 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In May, we issued $2.6 billion in Senior Notes due 2026, 2028, 2031 and 2052. Using a portion of the proceeds, we repaid approximately $659.9 million of term loans and redeemed all of our outstanding $1.25 billion 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, Americas revenue increased by $314.0 million or 12% (and also 12% on a constant currency basis). Growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to:•approximately $112.7 million of incremental revenues from the Packet and Bell acquisitions;•$67.7 million of incremental revenues generated from our IBX data center expansions;•higher non-recurring revenues, primarily due to increases in EIS product sales; and•an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period.EMEA Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2021, EMEA revenue increased by $158.8 million or 8% (7% on a constant currency basis). Growth in EMEA revenues was primarily due to:•approximately $32.0 million of incremental revenues generated from our IBX data center expansions;•$28.2 million of incremental revenues from services provided to our joint ventures; and•an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period.The increase was partially offset by a net increase of $75.0 million of realized cash flow hedge losses from foreign currency forward contracts.Asia-Pacific Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Asia-Pacific revenue increased by $164.2 million or 13% (11% on a constant currency basis).

During the year ended December 31, 2021, Americas cost of revenues increased by $210.6 million or 17% (16% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Americas cost of revenues was primarily due to:•approximately $115.2 million of incremental cost of revenues from the Packet and Bell acquisitions; •$33.5 million of higher depreciation driven by IBX data center expansions;•$17.8 million of higher costs related to increased EIS product revenues;•$11.2 million of higher other cost of sales related to an increase in bandwidth for new vendors and an increase in equipment;•$11.1 million of higher repairs and maintenance expense driven by IBX data center expansions;•$10.0 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation, primarily due to headcount growth;•$8.8 million of higher tax, license, and insurance costs driven by IBX data center expansions; and•$5.3 million of higher consulting services driven by increases in security and IBX data center expansions.EMEA Cost of Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2021, EMEA cost of revenues increased by $122.7 million or 11% (9% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to:•$58.7 million of higher depreciation expenses driven by IBX data center expansions in the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and the UK;•$34.1 million of higher utilities costs driven by increased utility usage to support IBX data center expansions and utility price increases, primarily in Germany, the UK and France;58Table of Contents•$18.5 million of higher rent and facilities costs and repairs and maintenance expense, primarily in the UK and the Netherlands;•$18.2 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation, primarily due to headcount growth;•$17.8 million of higher costs related to EIS product revenues; and•$5.1 million of higher office expenses primarily due to additional software and support services.This increase was partially offset by a net increase of $30.1 million of realized cash flow hedge gains from foreign currency forward contracts and $9.7 million decrease of other third party costs, primarily in the Netherlands and the UK.Asia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Asia-Pacific cost of revenues increased by $64.9 million or 9% (7% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily due to:•$27.5 million of higher depreciation expense, primarily from IBX data center expansions in Hong Kong, Australia and Japan;•$10.1 million of higher costs related to increased EIS product revenues;•$8.3 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation, primarily due to headcount growth;•$7.2 million of higher utilities costs, primarily driven by increases in prices and higher utility usage in Singapore; and•$5.2 million of higher costs related to dark fiber and customer installations, primarily in Hong Kong.We expect Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific cost of revenues to increase in line with the growth of our business, including from the impacts of acquisitions.59Table of ContentsSales and Marketing Expenses.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, Americas sales and marketing expenses increased by $13.4 million or 3% (and also 3% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Americas sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $12.0 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, salaries and stock-based compensation, partially due to additional compensation expenses incurred related to our recent acquisitions and higher bonus and merit payments.EMEA Sales and Marketing Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2021, EMEA sales and marketing increased by $10.6 million or 7% (5% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to $10.2 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, salaries and stock-based compensation.Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expense did not materially change during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.We anticipate that we will continue to invest in sales and marketing initiatives across our three regions in line with the growth of our business. We also expect travel and entertainment expenses to increase as travel restrictions that were imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are eased. We expect our Americas sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to be higher than those of our other regions since certain global sales and marketing functions are located within the U.S.60Table of ContentsGeneral and Administrative Expenses.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, Americas general and administrative expenses increased by $120.0 million or 15% (and also 15% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to:•$70.3 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, primarily due to additional compensation expenses incurred related to headcount growth, including that from our recent acquisitions;•$39.9 million of higher depreciation expense associated with systems to support the integration of recent acquisitions and the growth of our business; and•$13.3 million of higher office expenses primarily due to additional software and support services.EMEA General and Administrative Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2021, EMEA general and administrative expenses increased by $44.7 million or 22% (20% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA general and administrative expenses was primarily due to:•$41.1 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, primarily due to headcount growth; and •$5.7 million of higher other operating expenses, primarily due to the prior year having lower costs attributable to a favorable legal settlement in the first quarter of 2020.This increase was partially offset by a net increase of $5.7 million of realized cash flow hedge gains from foreign currency forward contracts.61Table of ContentsAsia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses increased by $46.1 million or 44% (41% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expense was primarily due to:•$28.5 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, primarily due to additional compensation expenses incurred related to headcount growth, including that from our recent acquisitions;•$9.1 million of higher rent and facility costs, primarily related to our offices in Japan and Singapore; and•$6.7 million of consulting costs in support of our business growth.Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase across all three regions as we continue to invest in our operations to support our growth, including investments to enhance our technology platform, to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and to integrate recent acquisitions. We also expect travel and entertainment expenses to increase as travel restrictions that were imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are eased. Additionally, given that our corporate headquarters is located in the U.S., we expect the Americas general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to be higher than those of other regions.Transaction Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded transaction costs totaling $22.8 million, primarily related to costs incurred in connection with the formation of the new joint ventures and the GPX India Acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded transaction costs totaling $55.9 million, primarily related to costs incurred in connection with the acquisitions of Bell, Packet, and Axtel and the formation of the Asia-Pacific 1 Joint Venture.Impairment Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not record any impairment charge. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded impairment charges totaling $7.3 million in the Asia-Pacific region as a result of the fair value adjustment of the Asia-Pacific 1 Joint Venture xScale data centers, which were classified as held for sale assets before they were sold on December 17, 2020.Gain on Asset Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a gain of $10.8 million primarily related to the sale of the Dublin 5 (""DB5"") data center. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not record a significant amount of gain on asset sales.Income from Operations.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, EMEA income from operations did not materially change as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.Asia-Pacific Income from Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Asia-Pacific income from operations increased by $69.0 million or 20% (18% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth, as described above, as well as lower cost of revenues and sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues.62Table of ContentsInterest Income. Interest income was not significant for the year ended December 31, 2021 and was $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 0.17% versus 0.43% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $336.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $406.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to interest savings as a result of our recent refinancing activities. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we capitalized $24.5 million and $26.8 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. See Note 11 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other Income or Expense. We recorded net other expense of $50.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to approximately $32.0 million impairment charge resulting from the settlement of a pre-acquisition uncertain tax position, refer to below ""Income Taxes"" section for further information, as well as foreign currency exchange gains and losses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded net other income of $6.9 million, which was primarily due to foreign currency exchange gains and losses, net of the impact from derivative instruments used to manage foreign exchange risks.Loss on Debt Extinguishment. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded $115.1 million of net loss on debt extinguishment primarily due to the redemption of 2.875% Euro Senior Notes due 2026 and the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $145.8 million of loss on debt extinguishment primarily related to the redemption of the Senior Notes due 2022, 2024, 2025, and 2026.Income Taxes. We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income distributed to stockholders. We intend to distribute or have distributed the entire taxable income generated by the operations of our REIT and QRSs for the tax years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As such, other than tax attributable to state income taxes and foreign income and withholding taxes, no provision for income taxes has been included for the REIT and its QRSs in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. We have made TRS elections for some of our subsidiaries in and outside the U.S. In general, a TRS may provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs to provide and may hold assets that may not be REIT compliant.U.S. income taxes for the TRS entities located in the U.S. and foreign income taxes for our foreign operations regardless of whether the foreign operations are operated as QRSs or TRSs have been accrued, as necessary, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded $109.2 million and $146.2 million of income tax expenses, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 17.9% and 28.3%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The lower effective tax rate in 2021 as compared to 2020 is primarily due to the reversal of uncertain tax positions of $69.8 million resulting from the settlements of various tax audits in the United Kingdom (""UK""), Germany, and Australia, partially offset by $12.3 million resulting from the revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities in the EMEA region due to the UK corporate tax rate increase from 19% to 25% and the Dutch corporate tax rate increase from 25% to 25.8% enacted in the current period. Of the unrecognized tax benefits being realized in the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately $32.0 million is related to the uncertain tax position inherited from the Metronode Acquisition in 2018. The uncertain tax position was covered by an indemnification agreement with the Seller. The realization of the unrecognized tax benefits resulted in an impairment of the indemnification asset for the same amount, which has been included in Other Income (Expense) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a key factor in how we assess the operating performance of our segments and develop regional growth strategies such as IBX data center expansion decisions. We define adjusted EBITDA as income or loss from operations excluding depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs and gain on asset sales. See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below for more information about adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to income or loss from operations. Our adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):63Table of ContentsYears Ended December 31,$ Change% Change2021%2020%ActualActualConstant CurrencyAmericas$1,326,460 42 %$1,186,022 42 %$140,438 12 %12 %EMEA1,033,333 33 %974,246 34 %59,087 6 %5 %Asia-Pacific784,591 25 %692,630 24 %91,961 13 %11 %Total$3,144,384 100 %$2,852,898 100 %$291,486 10 %9 %Americas Adjusted EBITDA. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Americas adjusted EBITDA increased by $140.4 million or 12% (and also 12% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above.EMEA Adjusted EBITDA. During the year ended December 31, 2021, EMEA adjusted EBITDA increased by $59.1 million or 6% (5% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth, as described above.Asia-Pacific Adjusted EBITDA. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA increased by $92.0 million or 13% (11% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity and organic growth as described above.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but we believe that evaluating our ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, we use non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operations. Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We have presented such non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our results of operations in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and ability to perform in subsequent periods. We believe that if we did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze Equinix effectively. Investors should note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by us may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. Investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing non-GAAP financial measures used by us to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. Our primary non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted funds from operations (""AFFO""), exclude depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of our IBX data centers and do not reflect our current or future cash spending levels to support our business. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of an IBX data center do not recur with respect to such data center, although we may incur initial construction costs in future periods with respect to additional IBX data centers, and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to our initial investment. This is a trend we expect to continue. In addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of our IBX data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs incurred to build out our IBX data centers and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. Therefore, we exclude depreciation from our results of operations when evaluating our operations. 64Table of ContentsIn addition, in presenting adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, we exclude amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense is significantly affected by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions and these charges may vary in amount from period to period. We exclude amortization expense to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our prior periods. We exclude accretion expense, both as it relates to asset retirement obligations as well as accrued restructuring charge liabilities, as these expenses represent costs which we believe are not meaningful in evaluating our current operations. We exclude stock-based compensation expense, as it can vary significantly from period to period based on share price, the timing, size and nature of equity awards. As such, we, and many investors and analysts, exclude stock-based compensation expense to compare our results of operations with those of other companies. We also exclude restructuring charges. The restructuring charges relate to our decisions to exit leases for excess space adjacent to several of our IBX data centers, which we did not intend to build out, or our decision to reverse such restructuring charges. We also exclude impairment charges generally related to certain long-lived assets. The impairment charges are related to expense recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets are not recoverable. We also exclude gain or loss on asset sales as it represents profit or loss that is not meaningful in evaluating the current or future operating performance. Finally, we exclude transaction costs from AFFO and adjusted EBITDA to allow more comparable comparisons of our financial results to our historical operations. The transaction costs relate to costs we incur in connection with business combinations and the formation of joint ventures, including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Such charges generally are not relevant to assessing our long-term performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the transactions. Management believes items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, gain or loss on asset sales and transaction costs are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs may occur in future periods.Adjusted EBITDAThe following table shows the reconciliation from income from operations to adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):Years Ended December 31,202120202019Income from operations$1,108,162 $1,052,928 $1,169,631 Depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense1,660,524 1,427,010 1,285,296 Stock-based compensation expense363,774 311,020 236,539 Transaction costs22,769 55,935 24,781 Impairment charges— 7,306 15,790 Gain on asset sales(10,845)(1,301)(44,310)Adjusted EBITDA$3,144,384 $2,852,898 $2,687,727 Our adjusted EBITDA results have improved each year in total dollars due to our steady operating results, as discussed in ""Results of Operations"", as well as the nature of our business model consisting of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature, as also discussed in ""Overview"".Funds from Operations (""FFO"") and AFFOWe use FFO and AFFO, which are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in the REIT industry. FFO is calculated in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. FFO represents net income (loss), excluding gain (loss) from the disposition of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items.65Table of ContentsIn presenting AFFO, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future operating performance. AFFO represents FFO excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate assets, accretion, stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, a contract cost adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums, gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures, net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, and adjustments from FFO to AFFO for unconsolidated joint ventures' and noncontrolling interests' share of these items. The adjustments for installation revenue, straight-line rent expense and contract costs are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight-lined or amortized results in the consolidated statement of operations. We exclude the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings that have no current or future cash obligations. We exclude gain (loss) on debt extinguishment since it generally represents the write-off of initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings or a cost that is incurred to reduce future interest costs and is not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance. We include an income tax expense adjustment, which represents the non-cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes that do not relate to current period's operations. We deduct recurring capital expenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of its IBX data centers or other assets that are required to support current revenues. We also exclude net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, which represents results that may not recur and are not a good indicator of our current future operating performance.66Table of ContentsOur FFO and AFFO were as follows (in thousands): Years Ended December 31,202120202019Net income$499,728 $370,074 $507,245 Net gain (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests463 (297)205 Net income attributable to Equinix500,191 369,777 507,450 Adjustments:Real estate depreciation1,073,148 924,064 845,798 (Gain) loss on disposition of real estate property(6,439)4,063 (39,337)Adjustments for FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures6,097 2,726 645 FFO$1,572,997 $1,300,630 $1,314,556 Years Ended December 31,202120202019FFO$1,572,997 $1,300,630 $1,314,556 Adjustments:Installation revenue adjustment27,928 (125)11,031 Straight-line rent expense9,677 10,787 8,167 Contract cost adjustment(63,064)(35,675)(40,861)Amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums17,135 15,739 13,042 Stock-based compensation expense363,774 311,020 236,539 Non-real estate depreciation expense377,658 300,258 242,761 Amortization expense205,484 199,047 196,278 Accretion expense4,234 3,641 459 Recurring capital expenditures(199,089)(160,637)(186,002)Loss on debt extinguishment115,125 145,804 52,825 Transaction costs22,769 55,935 24,781 Impairment charges(1)31,847 7,306 15,790 Income tax expense (benefit) adjustment(1)(38,505)33,220 39,676 Adjustments for AFFO from unconsolidated joint ventures3,259 2,195 2,080 AFFO$2,451,229 $2,189,145 $1,931,122 (1)Impairment charges for 2021 relate to the impairment of an indemnification asset in Q2 2021 resulting from the settlement of a pre-acquisition uncertain tax position, which was recorded as Other Income (Expense) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This impairment charge was offset by the recognition of tax benefits in the same amount, which was included within the Income tax expense (benefit) adjustment line on the table above. Our AFFO results have improved due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in ""Results of Operations,"" as well as due to the nature of our business model which consists of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature as discussed earlier in ""Overview.""67Table of ContentsConstant Currency PresentationOur revenues and certain operating expenses (cost of revenues, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses) from our international operations have represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues and certain operating expenses. As a result, our revenues and certain operating expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. dollar against major international currencies. During the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, the U.S. dollar was stronger relative to the Brazilian real and Japanese yen, which resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency impact on revenue, operating income and adjusted EBITDA, and a favorable foreign currency impact on operating expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, the U.S. dollar was weaker relative to the Australian dollar, British Pound, Euro and Singapore dollar, which resulted in a favorable foreign currency impact on revenue, operating income and adjusted EBITDA, and an unfavorable foreign currency impact on operating expenses. In order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present period-over-period percentage changes in our revenues and certain operating expenses on a constant currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. Our constant currency presentation excludes the impact of our foreign currency cash flow hedging activities. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, we have presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our results of operations. To present this information, our current period revenues and certain operating expenses from entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2020 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2021 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2021 with the year ended December 31, 2020). Liquidity and Capital ResourcesSources and Uses of CashCustomer collections are our primary source of cash. We believe we have a strong customer base, and have continued to experience relatively strong collections. As of December 31, 2021, our principle sources of liquidity were $1.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. In addition to our cash and investment portfolio, we had $1.9 billion of additional liquidity available to us from our $2.0 billion revolving facility and general access to both public and private debt and the equity capital markets. We also have additional liquidity available to us from our ATM program, under which we may offer and sell from time to time our common stock in ""at the market"" transactions. As of December 31, 2021, we had $1.0 billion available for sale under the 2020 ATM Program. We believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities and external financing sources, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of the current portion of our debt as it becomes due, distribution of dividends and completion of our publicly-announced acquisitions, ordinary costs to operate the business, and expansion projects. We also believe that our financial resources will allow us to manage future possible impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations for the foreseeable future, which could include reductions in revenue and delays in payments from customers and partners. As we continue to grow, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build out of new IBX data centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as potential acquisitions and joint ventures. If the opportunity to expand is greater than planned we may further increase the level of capital expenditure to support this growth as well as pursue additional business and real estate acquisitions or joint ventures provided that we have or can access sufficient funding to pursue such expansion opportunities. We may elect to access the equity or debt markets from time to time opportunistically, particularly if financing is available on attractive terms. We will continue to evaluate our operating requirements and financial resources in light of future developments, including those relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.68Table of ContentsCash FlowYears Ended December 31,20212020Change(in thousands)Net cash provided by operating activities$2,547,206 $2,309,826 $237,380 Net cash used in investing activities(3,006,738)(3,426,972)420,234 Net cash provided by financing activities413,765 815,526 (401,761)Operating ActivitiesOur cash provided by our operations is generated by colocation, interconnection, managed infrastructure and other revenues. Our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include compensation and related costs, interest payments, other general corporate expenditures and taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $237.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020, primarily driven by improved results of operations partially offset by increases in cash paid for costs and operating expenses.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $420.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020, primarily due to $1.0 billion less spent on business acquisitions, which consisted of the Bell, Packet and Axtel acquisitions in 2020 and the GPX acquisition in 2021 and a $20.2 million decrease in purchases of investments. This decrease was partially offset by a $469.0 million increase in capital expenditures as a result of our expansion activity, a $125.8 million decrease in the proceeds from the sale of assets to our Joint Ventures and a $25.3 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of investments.Financing ActivitiesNet cash provided by financing activities decreased by $401.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020, primarily driven by a decrease of $1.7 billion in proceeds from public offerings of common stock, a $750.8 million decrease in proceeds from the revolving credit facility and term loan facilities, a $553.0 million decrease in proceeds from senior notes, a $95.0 million increase in dividend distributions and a $50.3 million increase in repayments of finance lease liabilities. This decrease is partially offset by a $2.4 billion decrease in the repayment of senior notes, a $199.6 million increase in proceeds from the ATM program, a $112.5 million decrease in the repayment of mortgage and loans payable, a $17.1 million decrease in debt issuance costs, a $15.5 million increase in proceeds from employee awards and a $12.5 million decrease in debt extinguishment costs.Material Cash CommitmentsAs of December 31, 2021, our principle commitments were primarily comprised of:•approximately $11.1 billion of principal from our senior notes (gross of debt issuance cost and debt discount);•approximately $2.7 billion of interest on mortgage payable, loans payable, senior notes and term loans, based on their respective interest rates and recognized over the life of these instruments, and the credit facility fee for the revolving credit facility; •$620.0 million of principal from our term loans, mortgage and loans payable (gross of debt issuance cost, debt discount, plus mortgage premium); •approximately $4.9 billion of total lease payments, which represents lease payments under finance and operating lease arrangements, including renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised;•approximately $1.0 billion of unaccrued capital expenditure contractual commitments, primarily for IBX equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided in connection with the work necessary to complete construction and open IBX data center expansion projects prior to making them available to customers for installation, the majority of which is payable within the next 12 months; and•approximately $1.3 billion of other non-capital purchase commitments, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods, services 69Table of Contentsor arrangements to be delivered or provided during 2022 and beyond, the majority of which is payable within the next two years.We believe that our sources of liquidity, including our expected future operating cash flows, are sized to adequately meet both the near and long term material cash commitments for the foreseeable future. For further information on maturities of lease liabilities and debt instruments, see Notes 10 and 11, respectively, within the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Contractual ObligationsWe have additional future equity contributions and commitments to the Joint Ventures with GIC that are in EMEA and APAC. For additional information, see the ""Equity Method Investments"" footnote within the Consolidated Financial Statements.Additionally, we entered into lease agreements with various landlords primarily for data center spaces and ground leases which have not yet commenced as of December 31, 2021. For additional information, see “Maturities of Lease Liabilities” in Note 10 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require significant judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain:• Accounting for income taxes;• Accounting for business combinations;• Accounting for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; • Accounting for property, plant and equipment; and• Accounting for leases.70Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Income Taxes.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as tax attributes such as operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or settled. The accounting standard for income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined by the accounting standard as a likelihood of more than 50%) that such assets will not be realized.A tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authority's widely understood administrative practices and precedents. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax benefit (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future tax consequences. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. If, based on the weight of that available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified.This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account a number of types of evidence, including the following: 1) the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, 2) sources of future taxable income, 3) taxable income in carryback years permitted by the tax law, and 4) tax planning strategies.In assessing the tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position, the tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.For purposes of the quarterly REIT asset tests, we estimate the fair market value of assets within our QRSs and TRSs using a discounted cash flow approach, by calculating the present value of forecasted future cash flows. We apply discount rates based on industry benchmarks relative to the market and forecasting risks. Other significant assumptions used to estimate the fair market value of assets in QRSs and TRSs include projected revenue growth, projected operating margins and projected capital expenditure. We revisit significant assumptions periodically to reflect any changes due to business or economic environment.As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had net total deferred tax liabilities of $280.5 million and $224.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had a total valuation allowance of $100.7 million and $82.3 million, respectively. If and when we increase or reduce our valuation allowances, it may have an unfavorable or favorable impact, respectively, to our financial position and results of operations in the periods when such determinations are made. We will continue to assess the need for our valuation allowances, by jurisdiction, in the future.During the year ended December 31, 2021, we established full valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets of one of our Hong Kong legal entities as well as certain deferred tax assets acquired in India and Canada that are not expected to be realizable in the foreseeable future. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we provided full valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets acquired in Canada and the Netherlands that are not expected to be realizable in the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $148.3 million and $207.8 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the unrecognized tax benefit decreased by $59.5 million primarily due to the settlements of various tax audits in the UK, Germany, and Australia, which was partially offset by the integrations in the EMEA region. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the unrecognized tax benefit increased by $34.1 million primarily due to integrations in the EMEA region, which was partially offset by the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits related to our tax positions in a few countries as a result of a lapse in statutes of limitations and the partial payment related to the UK integration. The unrecognized tax benefits of $148.3 million as of December 31, 2021, of which $3.4 million is subject to an indemnification agreement, if subsequently recognized, will affect our effective tax rate favorably at the time when such a benefit is recognized.71Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Business CombinationsIn accordance with the accounting standard for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as customer contracts, leases and any other significant assets or liabilities and contingent consideration, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date if we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires assumptions and management's judgment to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Key judgments used to estimate the fair value of intangible assets include projected revenue growth and operating margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. During the last three years, we have completed a number of business combinations, including the acquisition of GPX in India in the third quarter of 2021, Bell Data Centers in Canada in the fourth quarter of 2020, Packet in March 2020, Axtel in Mexico in January 2020, and Switch Datacenters' AMS1 data center business in Amsterdam, Netherlands in April 2019. The purchase price allocation for these acquisitions has been finalized, except for the GPX India acquisition.As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had net intangible assets of $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. We recorded amortization expense for intangible assets of $205.5 million, $199.0 million and $196.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we used to complete the purchase price allocations and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, which would be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in 2021 or beyond. 72Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsIn accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform goodwill and other intangible assets impairment reviews annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We complete the annual goodwill impairment assessment for the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific reporting units to determine if the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values. We perform a review of other intangible assets for impairment by assessing events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. To perform annual goodwill impairment assessment, we elected to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. This analysis requires assumptions and estimates before performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test, where the assessment requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. Additionally, we periodically review our assessment of our reporting units to determine if changes in facts and circumstances warrant changes to our conclusions. There were no specific factors present in 2021 or 2020 that indicated a potential goodwill impairment. We performed our annual review of other intangible assets by assessing if there were events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, such as a significant decrease in market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset or a continuous deterioration of our financial condition. This assessment requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. There were no specific events in 2021 or 2020 that indicated a potential impairment.As of December 31, 2021, goodwill attributable to the Americas, the EMEA and the Asia-Pacific reporting units was $2.2 billion, $2.5 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively.Future events, changing market conditions and any changes in key assumptions may result in an impairment charge. While we have not recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill to date, the development of adverse business conditions in our Americas, EMEA or Asia-Pacific reporting units, such as higher than anticipated customer churn or significantly increased operating costs, or significant deterioration of our market comparables that we use in the market approach, could result in an impairment charge in future periods.The balance of our other intangible assets, net, for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. While we have not recorded an impairment charge against our other intangible assets to date, future events or changes in circumstances, such as a significant decrease in market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate, may result in an impairment charge in future periods. Any potential impairment charge against our goodwill and other intangible assets would not exceed the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.73Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Property, Plant and EquipmentWe have a substantial amount of property, plant and equipment recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The vast majority of our property, plant and equipment represent the costs incurred to build out or acquire our IBX data centers. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets. We depreciate our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (subject to the term of the lease in the case of leased assets or leasehold improvements and integral equipment located in leased properties). Accounting for property, plant and equipment includes determining the appropriate period in which to depreciate such assets, assessing such assets for potential impairment, capitalizing interest during periods of construction and assessing the asset retirement obligations required for certain leased properties that require us to return the leased properties back to their original condition at the time we decide to exit a leased property.Judgments are required in arriving at the estimated useful life of an asset and changes to these estimates would have significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. When we lease a property for our IBX data centers, we generally enter into long-term arrangements with renewal options generally available to us. In the next several years, a number of leases for our IBX data centers will come up for renewal. As we start approaching the end of these initial lease terms, we will need to reassess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment. In addition, we may find that our estimates for the useful lives of non-leased assets may also need to be revised periodically. We periodically review the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment and changes in these estimates in the future are possible. The assessment of long-lived assets for impairment requires assumptions and estimates of undiscounted and discounted future cash flows. These assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and are inherently uncertain.As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had property, plant and equipment of $15.4 billion and $14.5 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded depreciation expense of $1.5 billion, $1.2 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively. While we evaluated the appropriateness, we did not revise the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Further changes in our estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment could have a significant impact on our results of operations.Accounting for LeasesA significant portion of our data center spaces, office spaces and equipment are leased. Each time we enter into a new lease or lease amendments, we analyze each lease or lease amendment for the proper accounting, including determining if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception and making assessment of the leased properties to determine if they are operating or finance leases. Determination of accounting treatment, including the result of the lease classification test for each new lease or lease amendment, is dependent on a variety of judgments, such as identification of lease and non-lease components, allocation of total consideration between lease and non-lease components, determination of lease term, including assessing the likelihood of lease renewals, valuation of leased property, and establishing the incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payment for the lease test. The judgments used in the accounting for leases are inherently subjective; different assumptions or estimates could result in different accounting treatment for a lease.Lease assumptions and estimates are determined and applied at the inception of the leases or at the lease modification date. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, operating right-of-use (""ROU"") lease assets were at $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, and operating lease liabilities were at $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion respectively . As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, finance ROU assets were $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, and finance lease liabilities were $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded the finance lease cost of $275.0 million, $233.9 million and $193.6 million , respectively, and recorded rent expense of approximately $221.8 million, $217.3 million and $219.0 million, respectively.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee ""Recent Accounting Pronouncements"" in Note 1 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.74Table of ContentsITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket Risk The following discussion about market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity.The uncertainty that exists with respect to the economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic introduced significant volatility in the financial markets. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding potential risks to our business, financial condition and results of operations related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.We employ foreign currency forward and option contracts, cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate locks for the purpose of hedging certain specifically identified exposures. The use of these financial instruments is intended to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates, but does not eliminate such risks. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Investment Portfolio RiskWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities that is prioritized on meeting REIT asset requirements. All of our marketable securities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair values recognized in net income. We consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge for our securities, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. We anticipate that we will recover the entire cost basis of these securities and have determined that no other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were required to be recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021.As of December 31, 2021, our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market funds, certificates of deposits and publicly traded equity securities. The amount in our investment portfolio that could be susceptible to market risk totaled $585.7 million.Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our outstanding debt. An immediate increase or decrease in current interest rates from their position as of December 31, 2021 would not have a material impact on our interest expense due to the fixed coupon rate on the majority of our debt obligations. However, the interest expense associated with our senior credit facility and term loans that bear interest at variable rates could be affected. For every 100-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, our annual interest expense could increase by approximately $5.5 million or decrease by approximately $1.4 million based on the total balance of our term loan borrowings as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had not employed any interest rate derivative products to hedge our variable rate debt obligations. However, we may enter into interest rate hedging agreements in the future to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk.We periodically enter into interest rate locks to hedge the interest rate exposure created by anticipated fixed rate debt issuances, which are designated as cash flow hedges. When interest rate locks are settled, any accumulated gain or loss included as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the forecasted hedged transaction which is equivalent to the term of the interest rate locks. The fair value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate changes may affect the fair value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair value of our mortgage and loans payable, which are not traded in the market, is estimated by considering our credit rating, current rates available to us for debt of the same remaining maturities and the terms of the debt. The fair value of our other senior notes, which are traded in the market, was based on quoted market prices. The following table represents the carrying value and estimated fair value of our mortgage and loans payable and senior notes as of (in thousands):75Table of ContentsDecember 31, 2021December 31, 2020Carrying Value (1)Fair ValueCarrying Value (1)Fair ValueMortgage and loans payable$618,388 $621,051 $1,370,970 $1,379,129 Senior notes11,102,130 11,049,834 9,261,050 9,705,486 (1)The carrying value is gross of debt issuance cost, debt discount and debt premium.Foreign Currency Risk To help manage the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we have implemented a number of hedging programs, in particular (i) a cash flow hedging program to hedge the forecasted revenues and expenses in our EMEA region, (ii) a balance sheet hedging program to hedge the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, and (iii) a net investment hedging program to hedge the long term investments in our foreign subsidiaries. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements and their impact on the consolidated statements of operations.We have entered into various foreign currency debt obligations. As of December 31, 2021, the total principal amount of foreign currency debt obligations was $1.8 billion, including $1.3 billion denominated in Euro and $549.7 million denominated in British Pound. As of December 31, 2021, we have designated $1.5 billion of the total principal amount of foreign currency debt obligations as net investment hedges against our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. For a net investment hedge, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument designated as a net investment hedge are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the U.S. Dollar will impact the amount of U.S. Dollars that we will require to settle the foreign currency debt obligations at maturity. If the U.S. Dollar would have been weaker or stronger by 10% in comparison to these foreign currencies as of December 31, 2021, we estimate our obligation to cash settle the principal of these foreign currency debt obligations in U.S. Dollars would have increased or decreased by approximately $200.2 million and $163.8 million, respectively. We are also party to cross-currency interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total notional amounts of cross-currency interest rate swap contracts outstanding were $4.0 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. The cross-currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries and changes in the fair value of these swaps are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets. If the U.S. Dollar weakened or strengthened by 10% in comparison to foreign currencies, we estimate our obligation to cash settle these hedges would have increased or decreased by approximately $456.3 million and $374.0 million, respectively.The U.S. Dollar strengthened relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate during the year ended December 31, 2021. This has impacted our consolidated financial position and results of operations during this period, including the amount of revenues that we reported. Continued strengthening or weakening of the U.S. Dollar will continue to impact us in future periods. With the existing cash flow hedges in place, a hypothetical additional 10% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar during the year ended December 31, 2021 would have resulted in a reduction of our revenues and a reduction of our operating expenses including depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $205.1 million and $202.2 million, respectively.With the existing cash flow hedges in place, a hypothetical additional 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar during the year ended December 31, 2021 would have resulted in an increase of our revenues and an increase of our operating expenses including depreciation and amortization expenses, by approximately $255.4 million and $253.7 million, respectively.76Table of ContentsCommodity Price RiskCertain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of price changes are electricity, supplies and equipment used in our IBX data centers. We closely monitor the cost of electricity at all of our locations. We have entered into several power contracts to purchase power at fixed prices in certain locations in the Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the U.S..In addition, as we are building new, or expanding existing, IBX data centers, we are subject to commodity price risk for building materials related to the construction of these IBX data centers, such as steel and copper. In addition, the lead-time to procure certain pieces of equipment, such as generators, is substantial. Any delays in procuring the necessary pieces of equipment for the construction of our IBX data centers could delay the anticipated openings of these new IBX data centers and, as a result, increase the cost of these projects.We do not currently employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to address commodity price risk other than the power contracts discussed above.",2023-12-30 20:28:07.782219
1101239,EQIX,EQUINIX INC,2023,"ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information in this discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements are based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. For example, the words ""believes,"" ""anticipates,"" ""plans,"" ""expects,"" ""intends"" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those discussed in ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"" and ""Risk Factors"" elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to us as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.Item 7 of this Form 10-K focuses on discussion of 2022 and 2021 items as well as 2022 results as compared to 2021 results. For the discussion of 2020 items and 2021 results as compared to 2020 results, please refer to Item 7 of our 2021 Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on February 18, 2022.Our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist readers in understanding our financial information from our management's perspective and is presented as follows:•Overview•Results of Operations•Non-GAAP Financial Measures•Liquidity and Capital Resources•Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates•Recent Accounting PronouncementsOverview We provide a global, vendor-neutral data center, interconnection and edge solutions platform with offerings that aim to enable our customers to reach everywhere, interconnect everyone and integrate everything. Global enterprises, service providers and business ecosystems of industry partners rely on our IBX data centers and expertise around the world for the safe housing of their critical IT equipment and to protect and connect the world's most valued information assets. They also look to Platform Equinix® for the ability to directly and securely interconnect to the networks, clouds and content that enable today's information-driven global digital economy. Our 50Table of Contentsrecent IBX data center openings and acquisitions, as well as xScaleTM data center investments, have expanded our total global footprint to 248 data centers, including 11 xScale data centers and the MC1 data center that are held in unconsolidated joint ventures, across 71 markets around the world. We offer the following solutions:•premium data center colocation;•interconnection and data exchange solutions;•edge solutions for deploying networking, security and hardware; and•remote expert support and professional services.Our interconnected data centers around the world allow our customers to increase information and application delivery performance to users, and quickly access distributed IT infrastructures and business and digital ecosystems, while significantly reducing costs. Our global platform and the quality of our IBX data centers, interconnection offerings and edge solutions have enabled us to establish a critical mass of customers. As more customers choose Platform Equinix for bandwidth cost and performance reasons, it benefits their suppliers and business partners to colocate in the same data centers. This adjacency creates a “network effect” that enables our customers to capture the full economic and performance benefits of our offerings. These partners, in turn, pull in their business partners, creating a ""marketplace"" for their services. Our global platform enables scalable, reliable and cost-effective interconnection that increases data traffic exchange while lowering overall cost and increasing flexibility. Our focused business model is built on our critical mass of enterprise and service provider customers and the resulting ""marketplace"" effect. This global platform, combined with our strong financial position, has continued to drive new customer growth and bookings.Historically, our market was served by large telecommunications carriers who bundled their products and services with their colocation offerings. The data center market landscape has evolved to include private and vendor-neutral multi-tenant data center (""MTDC"") providers, hyperscale cloud providers, managed infrastructure and application hosting providers, and systems integrators. It is estimated that Equinix is one of more than 2,200 companies that provide MTDC offerings around the world. Each of these data center solutions providers can bundle various colocation, interconnection and network offerings and outsourced IT infrastructure solutions. We are able to offer our customers a global platform that reaches 32 countries with the industry’s largest and most active ecosystem of partners in our sites, proven operational reliability, improved application performance and a highly scalable set of offerings.Our cabinet utilization rate represents the percentage of cabinet space billed versus total cabinet capacity, which is used to measure how efficiently we are managing our cabinet capacity. Our cabinet utilization rate varies from market to market among our IBX data centers across our Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. Our cabinet utilization rates were approximately 82% and 79%, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We continue to monitor the available capacity in each of our selected markets. To the extent we have limited capacity available in a given market, it may limit our ability for growth in that market. We perform demand studies on an ongoing basis to determine if future expansion is warranted in a market. In addition, power and cooling requirements for most customers are growing on a per unit basis. As a result, customers are consuming an increasing amount of power per cabinet. Although we generally do not control the amount of power our customers draw from installed circuits, we have negotiated power consumption limitations with certain high power-demand customers. This increased power consumption has driven us to build out our new IBX data centers to support power and cooling needs twice that of previous IBX data centers. We could face power limitations in our IBX data centers, even though we may have additional physical cabinet capacity available within a specific IBX data center. This could have a negative impact on our ability to grow revenues, affecting our financial performance, results of operations and cash flows.To serve the needs of the growing hyperscale data center market, including the world's largest cloud service providers, we have entered into joint ventures to develop and operate xScale data centers. In the past two years, we have closed multiple joint ventures in the form of limited liability partnerships with GIC Private Limited, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund (""GIC"") and an additional joint venture in the form of a limited liability partnership with PGIM Real Estate (""PGIM""). 51Table of ContentsStrategically, we will continue to look at attractive opportunities to grow our market share and selectively improve our footprint and offerings. As was the case with our recent expansions and acquisitions, our expansion criteria will be dependent on a number of factors, including but not limited to demand from new and existing customers, quality of the design, power capacity, access to networks, clouds and software partners, capacity availability in the current market location, amount of incremental investment required by us in the targeted property, automation capabilities, developer talent pool, lead-time to break even on a free cash flow basis and in-place customers. Like our recent expansions and acquisitions, the right combination of these factors may be attractive to us. Depending on the circumstances, these transactions may require additional capital expenditures funded by upfront cash payments or through long-term financing arrangements in order to bring these properties up to our standards. Property expansion may be in the form of purchases of real property, long-term leasing arrangements or acquisitions. Future purchases, construction or acquisitions may be completed by us or with partners or potential customers to minimize the outlay of cash, which can be significant.Revenue:Our business is based on a recurring revenue model comprised of colocation and related interconnection and managed infrastructure offerings. We consider these offerings recurring because our customers are generally billed on a fixed and recurring basis each month for the duration of their contract, which is generally one to three years in length, and thereafter automatically renews in one-year increments. Our recurring revenues have comprised more than 90% of our total revenues during the past three years. In addition, during the past three years, more than 90% of our monthly recurring revenue bookings came from existing customers, contributing to our revenue growth. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 3% of our recurring revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Our 50 largest customers accounted for approximately 36% of our recurring revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 39% of our recurring revenues for the years ended 2021 and 2020.Our non-recurring revenues are primarily derived from fees charged from installations related to a customer's initial deployment and professional services we perform. These services are considered to be non-recurring because they are billed typically once, upon completion of the installation or the professional services work performed. The majority of these non-recurring revenues are typically billed on the first invoice distributed to the customer in connection with their initial installation. However, revenues from installations are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the contract term. Additionally, revenue from contract settlements, when a customer wishes to terminate their contract early, is generally treated as a contract modification and recognized ratably over the remaining term of the contract, if any. As a percentage of total revenues, we expect non-recurring revenues to represent less than 10% of total revenues for the foreseeable future. Operating Expenses:Cost of Revenues. The largest components of our cost of revenues are depreciation, rental payments related to our leased IBX data centers, utility costs, including electricity, bandwidth access, IBX data center employees' salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation, repairs and maintenance, supplies and equipment, and security. A majority of our cost of revenues is fixed in nature and should not vary significantly from period to period, unless we expand our existing IBX data centers or open or acquire new IBX data centers. However, there are certain costs that are considered more variable in nature, including utilities and supplies that are directly related to growth in our existing and new customer base. In addition, the cost of electricity is generally higher in the summer months, as compared to other times of the year. Our costs of electricity may also increase as a result of the physical 52Table of Contentseffects of climate change, global energy supply constraints, increased regulations driving alternative electricity generation due to environmental considerations or as a result of our election to use renewable energy sources. To the extent we incur increased utility costs, such increased costs could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Sales and Marketing. Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation, amortization of contract costs, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials and travel, as well as bad debt expense and amortization of customer relationship intangible assets.General and Administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, accounting, legal and other professional service fees; and other general corporate expenses, such as our corporate regional headquarters office leases and some depreciation expense on back office systems.Taxation as a REIT We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (""REIT"") beginning with our 2015 taxable year. As of December 31, 2022, our REIT structure included all of our data center operations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Chile, Japan, Singapore and the majority of our data centers in EMEA. Our data center operations in other jurisdictions are operated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (""TRSs""). We included our share of the assets in xScale joint ventures (with the exception of Korea) in our REIT structure.As a REIT, we generally are permitted to deduct from our U.S. federal taxable income the dividends we pay to our stockholders. The income represented by such dividends is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the entity level but is taxed, if at all, at the stockholder level. Nevertheless, the income of our TRSs which hold our U.S. operations that may not be REIT compliant is subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income taxes, as applicable. Likewise, our foreign subsidiaries continue to be subject to local income taxes in jurisdictions in which they hold assets or conduct operations, regardless of whether held or conducted through TRSs or through qualified REIT subsidiaries (""QRSs""). We are also subject to a separate U.S. federal corporate income tax on any gain recognized from a sale of a REIT asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a C corporation (such as an asset held by us or a QRS following the liquidation or other conversion of a former TRS). This built-in-gains tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a REIT asset to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a REIT asset. In addition, should we recognize any net gain from ""prohibited transactions,"" we will be subject to tax on this net gain at a 100% rate. ""Prohibited transactions,"" for this purpose, are defined as dispositions, at a gain, of inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business other than dispositions of foreclosure property and other than dispositions excepted by statutory safe harbors. If we fail to remain qualified for U.S. federal income taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates. Even if we remain qualified for U.S. federal income taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property in addition to taxes owed with respect to our TRSs' operations. In particular, while state income tax regimes often parallel the U.S. federal income tax regime for REITs, many states do not completely follow federal rules, and some may not follow them at all.We continue to monitor our REIT compliance in order to maintain our qualification for U.S. federal income taxation as a REIT. For this and other reasons, as necessary, we may convert some of our data center operations in other countries into the REIT structure in future periods.On each of March 23, June 15, September 21, and December 14, 2022 we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $3.10 per share. We expect the amount of all our applicable quarterly dividend distributions and other applicable distributions to equal or exceed our REIT taxable income that we recognized in 2022.The Impact of the Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Results and OperationsWe have continued to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our people and business. As of the time of this filing, our offices are open to employees and we have also resumed in-person events as local travel restrictions allow.53Table of ContentsFor additional details regarding the impacts and risks to our results of operations from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, refer to ""Results of Operations"" section below and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.2022 Highlights:•In February, we entered into an equity forward amendment to our existing ""at the market"" equity offering program (the ""2020 ATM Program""), under which we could, from time to time, offer and sell shares under the equity distribution agreement pursuant to forward sale transactions (the ""Equity Forward Amendment""). See Note 12 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In March, we entered into a joint venture in the form of a limited liability partnership with PGIM to develop and operate additional xScale data centers in Asia-Pacific (the ""Asia-Pacific 2 Joint Venture""). See Note 5 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In March, we entered into an agreement to sell the Mexico 3 (""MX3"") data center site in connection with the formation of a new joint venture with GIC, to develop and operate xScale data centers in the Americas (the ""AMER 1 Joint Venture""). See Note 5 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In April, we completed the acquisition of MainOne Cable Company Ltd. (""MainOne""), consisting of four data centers as well as a subsea cable and terrestrial fiber network. We acquired MainOne and its assets for a total purchase consideration of $278.4 million. See Note 3 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In April, we issued $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.900% Senior Notes due 2032 (the ""2032 Notes""). See Note 11 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In April, we entered into a joint venture in the form of a limited liability partnership with GIC, to develop and operate two xScale data centers in Seoul, Korea (the ""Asia-Pacific 3 Joint Venture""). Upon closing, we contributed $17.0 million in exchange for a 20% partnership interest in the joint venture. See Note 6 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In May, we completed the acquisition of four data centers in Chile from Empresa Nacional De Telecomunicaciones S.A. (""Entel"") for a total purchase consideration of $638.3 million at the exchange rate in effect on May 2, 2022. See Note 3 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In August, we completed the acquisition of a data center in Peru from Entel for a purchase consideration of $80.3 million at the exchange rate in effect on August 1, 2022. See Note 3 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In August, we settled all five forward sale agreements under the Equity Forward Amendment and sold 579,873 shares of our common stock for approximately $393.6 million, net of payment of commissions to sales agents and other offering expenses, at an aggregate weighted-average forward sale price of $678.72 per share. See Note 12 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In August, we sold an additional 580,833 shares, excluding the forward sale transactions noted above, under the 2020 ATM Program for approximately $403.6 million in proceeds, net of payment of commissions to sales agents and other offering expenses. See Note 12 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.•In November, we established a successor ATM program (the ""2022 ATM Program""), under which we may, from time to time, offer and sell on a spot or forward basis up to an aggregate of $1.5 billion of our common stock to or through sales agents in ""at the market"" transactions. See Note 12 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.Results of OperationsOur results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 include the results of operations from a data center in Peru acquired from Entel from August 1, 2022, four data centers in Chile acquired from Entel from May 2, 2022, the acquisition of MainOne from April 1, 2022 and two data centers acquired from GPX India from September 1, 2021. See Note 3 within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.54Table of ContentsIn order to provide a framework for assessing our performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we supplement the year-over-year actual change in results of operations with comparative changes on a constant currency basis. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for further discussion. Years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Revenues. Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were generated from the following revenue classifications and geographic regions (dollars in thousands):Years Ended December 31,$ Change% Change2022%2021%ActualActualConstant CurrencyAmericas:Recurring revenues$3,183,191 44%$2,861,937 43%$321,254 11%11%Non-recurring revenues166,026 2%159,814 3%6,212 4%4%3,349,217 46%3,021,751 46%327,466 11%11%EMEA:Recurring revenues2,207,329 30%2,001,931 30%205,398 10%13%Non-recurring revenues135,875 2%153,285 2%(17,410)(11)%(1)%2,343,204 32%2,155,216 32%187,988 9%12%Asia-Pacific:Recurring revenues1,480,767 21%1,356,617 21%124,150 9%18%Non-recurring revenues89,917 1%101,953 1%(12,036)(12)%(3)%1,570,684 22%1,458,570 22%112,114 8%16%Total:Recurring revenues6,871,287 95%6,220,485 94%650,802 10%13%Non-recurring revenues391,818 5%415,052 6%(23,234)(6)%1%$7,263,105 100%$6,635,537 100%$627,568 9%12%55Table of ContentsRevenues (dollars in thousands)Americas Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Americas revenue increased by $327.5 million or 11% (and also 11% on a constant currency basis). Growth in Americas revenues was primarily due to:•approximately $30.3 million of incremental revenues generated from the Entel Chile and Entel Peru acquisitions;•$44.6 million of incremental revenues generated from our IBX data center expansions; and•an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period.EMEA Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2022, EMEA revenue increased by $188.0 million or 9% (12% on a constant currency basis). Growth in EMEA revenues was primarily due to:•$59.6 million of incremental revenues generated from the MainOne acquisition;•approximately $32.0 million of incremental revenues generated from our IBX data center expansions;•$9.3 million of incremental revenues from services provided to our joint ventures; and•an increase in orders from both our existing customers and new customers during the period.Asia-Pacific Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Asia-Pacific revenue increased by $112.1 million or 8% (16% on a constant currency basis). Growth in Asia-Pacific revenues was primarily due to:•approximately $60.2 million of incremental revenues generated from our IBX data center expansions;•$14.3 million incremental revenues generated from the GPX India acquisition; and•incremental revenues generated from power price increases in Singapore in response to the increased cost of utilities as noted below.56Table of ContentsCost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):Years Ended December 31,$ Change% Change2022%2021%ActualActualConstant CurrencyAmericas$1,560,799 42%$1,458,699 42%$102,100 7%7%EMEA1,281,023 34%1,216,990 35%64,033 5%11%Asia-Pacific909,679 24%796,733 23%112,946 14%24%Total$3,751,501 100%$3,472,422 100%$279,079 8%12%Cost of Revenues (dollars in thousands; percentages indicate expenses as a percentage of revenues)Americas Cost of Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Americas cost of revenues increased by $102.1 million or 7% (and also 7% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Americas cost of revenues was primarily due to:•$48.5 million of higher utilities, primarily driven by comparatively lower costs in 2021 resulting from gains recognized from wind farm settlements in Texas and Oklahoma due to extreme weather conditions, current period increases in power costs, higher utility usage and IBX data center expansions;•$20.1 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation, primarily due to headcount growth;•$15.2 million of incremental cost of revenues from the Entel Chile and Entel Peru acquisitions; and•$10.9 million of higher depreciation expense driven by IBX data center expansions.EMEA Cost of Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2022, EMEA cost of revenues increased by $64.0 million or 5% (11% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA cost of revenues was primarily due to:•$35.4 million of incremental cost of revenues from the MainOne Acquisition; and•after accounting for changes in foreign currency rates and hedge loss allocations:◦approximately $13 million in utilities costs, primarily driven by increases in power costs and higher utility usage in France and the United Kingdom;◦approximately $11 million in depreciation expense driven by IBX data center expansions; and◦approximately $7 million in compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses and stock-based compensation, primarily due to headcount growth.57Table of ContentsAsia-Pacific Cost of Revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Asia-Pacific cost of revenues increased by $112.9 million or 14% (24% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Asia-Pacific cost of revenues was primarily due to:•$99.5 million of higher utilities primarily driven by increases in power cost and higher utility usage in Singapore;•$11.4 million of incremental cost of revenues from the GPX India acquisition; •$10.3 million of higher rent and facilities costs, primarily in Hong Kong; and•$8.1 million of higher depreciation expense driven by IBX data center expansions in Singapore.This increase was partially offset by $13.6 million of lower other cost of revenue, primarily due to decreased customer installations.We expect Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific cost of revenues to increase in line with the growth of our business, including from the impacts of acquisitions.Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):Years ended December 31,$ Change% Change2022%2021%ActualActualConstant CurrencyAmericas$501,943 64%$470,985 64%$30,958 7%7%EMEA183,754 23%172,930 23%10,824 6%11%Asia-Pacific100,863 13%97,317 13%3,546 4%11%Total$786,560 100%$741,232 100%$45,328 6%8%Sales and Marketing Expenses(dollars in thousands; percentages indicate expenses as a percentage of revenues)Americas Sales and Marketing Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Americas sales and marketing expenses increased by $31.0 million or 7% (and also 7% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Americas sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to:•$18.0 million of higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, salaries and stock-based compensation, partially due to additional compensation expenses incurred related to our recent acquisitions and headcount growth; and•$8.0 million of higher travel and entertainment expenses due to the easing of COVID-19 travel restrictions.58Table of ContentsEMEA Sales and Marketing Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2022, EMEA sales and marketing increased by $10.8 million or 6% (11% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to higher compensation costs, including sales compensation, salaries and stock-based compensation, partially due to additional compensation expenses incurred related to our recent acquisitions and headcount growth.Asia-Pacific Sales and Marketing Expenses. Our Asia-Pacific sales and marketing expense did not materially change during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.We anticipate that we will continue to invest in sales and marketing initiatives across our three regions in line with the growth of our business. We expect our Americas sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to be higher than those of our other regions since certain global sales and marketing functions are located within the U.S.General and Administrative Expenses. Our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):Years Ended December 31,$ Change% Change2022%2021%ActualActualConstant CurrencyAmericas$980,589 66%$902,037 69%$78,552 9%9%EMEA301,317 20%248,295 19%53,022 21%27%Asia-Pacific216,795 14%151,465 12%65,330 43%51%Total$1,498,701 100%$1,301,797 100%$196,904 15%17%General and Administrative Expenses (dollars in thousands; percentages indicate expenses as a percentage of revenues)Americas General and Administrative Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Americas general and administrative expenses increased by $78.6 million or 9% (and also 9% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Americas general and administrative expenses was primarily due to:•$46.8 million of higher depreciation expense associated with back-office systems to support the growth of our business;•$40.7 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, primarily due to additional compensation expenses incurred related to our recent acquisitions and headcount growth;•$24.0 million of higher office expenses primarily due to additional software and support services; and•$10.4 million of higher travel and entertainment expenses due to the easing of COVID-19 travel restrictions.59Table of ContentsThis increase was partially offset by $40.9 million of lower consulting costs driven by an increase in the conversion of contingent workers to full time employees. EMEA General and Administrative Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2022, EMEA general and administrative expenses increased by $53.0 million or 21% (27% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our EMEA general and administrative expenses was primarily due to:•$34.0 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, primarily due to headcount growth; and•$10.0 million higher travel and entertainment expenses due to the easing of COVID-19 travel restrictions.Asia-Pacific General and Administrative Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Asia-Pacific general and administrative expenses increased by $65.3 million or 43% (51% on a constant currency basis). The increase in our Asia-Pacific general and administrative expense was primarily due to:•$39.5 million of higher compensation costs, including salaries, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, primarily due to headcount growth; and •$28.5 million of higher consulting costs in support of our business growth and location strategy.Going forward, although we are carefully monitoring our spending, we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase across all three regions as we continue to invest in our operations to support our growth, including investments to enhance our technology platform, and to integrate recent acquisitions. Additionally, given that our corporate headquarters is located in the U.S., we expect the Americas general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to be higher than that of other regions.Transaction Costs. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded transaction costs totaling $21.8 million, primarily related to costs incurred in connection with the recent acquisitions and formation of the new joint ventures, see Notes 3, 5, and 6 within the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded transaction costs totaling $22.8 million, primarily related to costs incurred in connection with the formation of the new joint ventures and the GPX India Acquisition. Gain or Loss on Asset Sales. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we did not record a significant amount of loss on asset sales. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a gain of $10.8 million primarily related to the sale of the Dublin 5 (""DB5"") data center.Income from Operations. Our income from operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was split among the following geographic regions (dollars in thousands):Years Ended December 31,$ Change% Change2022%2021%ActualActualConstant CurrencyAmericas$283,975 24%$165,380 15%$118,595 72%71%EMEA575,331 48%530,888 48%44,443 8%3%Asia-Pacific341,222 28%411,894 37%(70,672)(17)%(10)%Total$1,200,528 100%$1,108,162 100%$92,366 8%8%Americas Income from Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Americas income from operations increased by $118.6 million or 72% (71% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity, the recent acquisitions and organic growth, as described above.EMEA Income from Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, EMEA income from operations increased by $44.4 million or 8% (3% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity, the recent acquisition and organic growth, as described above.Asia-Pacific Income from Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Asia-Pacific income from operations decreased by $70.7 million or 17% (10% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher operating 60Table of Contentsexpenses as a percentage of revenues, which included higher utility costs, primarily driven by increases in power prices and higher utility usage, as described above.Interest Income. Interest income was $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and was not significant for the year ended December 31, 2021. The average yield for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 1.74% versus 0.17% for the year ended December 31, 2021. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $356.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $336.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the issuance of the 3.900% Senior Notes due 2032. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we capitalized $18.2 million and $24.5 million, respectively, of interest expense to construction in progress. See Note 11 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other Expense. We recorded net other expense of $51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, including $49.0 million in stock-based charitable contributions and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded net other expense of $50.6 million, primarily due to an approximately $32.0 million impairment charge resulting from the settlement of a pre-acquisition uncertain tax position, refer to the ""Income Taxes"" section below for further information, as well as foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Gain or Loss on Debt Extinguishment. We did not record a significant amount of gain on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded $115.1 million of net loss on debt extinguishment primarily due to the redemption of 2.875% Euro Senior Notes due 2026 and the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2027.Income Taxes. We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we are generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income distributed to stockholders. We intend to distribute or have distributed the entire taxable income generated by the operations of our REIT and QRSs for the tax years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As such, other than state income taxes and foreign income and withholding taxes, no provision for income taxes has been included for our REIT and QRSs in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. We have made TRS elections for some of our subsidiaries in and outside the U.S. In general, a TRS may provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs to provide and may hold assets that may not be REIT compliant.U.S. income taxes for the TRS entities located in the U.S. and foreign income taxes for our foreign operations regardless of whether the foreign operations are operated as QRSs or TRSs have been accrued, as necessary, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded $124.8 million and $109.2 million of income tax expenses, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 15.0% and 17.9%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The lower effective tax rate in 2022 as compared to 2021 is primarily driven by the higher U.S. QRS income that is not subject to U.S. corporate income taxes, partially offset by an increase in valuation allowances in the Americas region.In the current period, we had a favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions of approximately $40.0 million resulting from the settlement of tax audits in the EMEA region. In the prior period, we had a favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions of approximately $70.0 million resulting from the settlement of various tax audits in the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. Of the unrecognized tax benefits realized in the prior period, approximately $32.0 million was related to the uncertain tax position inherited from the acquisition of Metronode in 2018. The uncertain tax position was covered by an indemnification agreement with the Seller. The realization of the unrecognized tax benefits resulted in an impairment of the indemnification asset for the same amount, which was included in Other Income (Expense) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a key factor in how we assess the operating performance of our segments and develop regional growth strategies such as IBX data center expansion decisions. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding income tax expense, interest income, interest expense, other income or expense, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs, and gain or loss on asset sales. See ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below for more information about adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to 61Table of Contentsnet income. Our adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 by geographic regions was as follows (dollars in thousands):Years Ended December 31,$ Change% Change2022%2021%ActualActualConstant CurrencyAmericas$1,521,775 45 %$1,326,460 42 %$195,315 15 %15 %EMEA1,109,502 33 %1,033,333 33 %76,169 7 %10 %Asia-Pacific738,423 22 %784,591 25 %(46,168)(6)%2 %Total$3,369,700 100 %$3,144,384 100 %$225,316 7 %10 %Americas Adjusted EBITDA. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Americas adjusted EBITDA increased by $195.3 million or 15% (and also 15% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity, the recent acquisitions and organic growth, as described above.EMEA Adjusted EBITDA. During the year ended December 31, 2022, EMEA adjusted EBITDA increased by $76.2 million or 7% (10% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher revenues as a result of our IBX data center expansion activity, the recent acquisition and organic growth, as described above.Asia-Pacific Adjusted EBITDA. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Asia-Pacific adjusted EBITDA decreased by $46.2 million or 6% (2% on a constant currency basis), primarily due to higher utility costs, as described above.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe provide all information required in accordance with GAAP, but we believe that evaluating our ongoing results of operations may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, we use non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operations. Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We have presented such non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our results of operations in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be our core, ongoing business operations. We believe that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and ability to perform in subsequent periods. We believe that if we did not provide such non-GAAP financial information, investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze us effectively. Investors should note that the non-GAAP financial measures used by us may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those of other companies. Investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing non-GAAP financial measures used by us to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. Our primary non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted funds from operations (""AFFO""), exclude depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of our IBX data centers and do not reflect our current or future cash spending levels to support our business. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets and have an economic life greater than 10 years. The construction costs of an IBX data center do not recur with respect to such data center, although we may incur initial construction costs in future periods with respect to additional IBX data centers, and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to our initial investment. This is a trend we expect to continue. In addition, depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of our IBX data centers. These estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset, are based on historical costs incurred to build out our IBX data centers and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures. Therefore, we exclude depreciation from our results of operations when evaluating our operations. 62Table of ContentsIn addition, in presenting adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, we exclude amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense is significantly affected by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions and these charges may vary in amount from period to period. We exclude amortization expense to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our prior periods. We exclude accretion expense, both as it relates to asset retirement obligations as well as accrued restructuring charge liabilities, as these expenses represent costs which we believe are not meaningful in evaluating our current operations. We also exclude restructuring charges. Restructuring charges relate to our decisions to exit leases for excess space adjacent to several of our IBX data centers, which we did not intend to build out, or our decision to reverse such restructuring charges. We also exclude impairment charges generally related to certain long-lived assets. The impairment charges are related to expense recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets are not recoverable. We also exclude gain or loss on asset sales as it represents profit or loss that is not meaningful in evaluating the current or future operating performance. Additionally, we exclude transaction costs from AFFO and adjusted EBITDA to allow more comparable comparisons of our financial results to our historical operations. The transaction costs relate to costs we incur in connection with business combinations and the formation of joint ventures, including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional or consulting fees. Such charges generally are not relevant to assessing our long-term performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the transactions. Management believes items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, gain or loss on asset sales and transaction costs are non-core transactions; however, these types of costs may occur in future periods. Finally, we exclude stock-based compensation expense, as it can vary significantly from period to period based on share price, and the timing, size and nature of equity awards. As such, we, and many investors and analysts, exclude stock-based compensation expense to compare our results of operations with those of other companies. Adjusted EBITDAWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding income tax expense, interest income, interest expense, other income or expense, gain or loss on debt extinguishment, depreciation, amortization, accretion, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs, and gain or loss on asset sales as presented below (in thousands):Years Ended December 31,202220212020Net income$704,577 $499,728 $370,074 Income tax expense124,792 109,224 146,151 Interest income(36,268)(2,644)(8,654)Interest expense356,337 336,082 406,466 Other (income) expense51,417 50,647 (6,913)(Gain) loss on debt extinguishment(327)115,125 145,804 Depreciation, amortization, and accretion expense1,739,374 1,660,524 1,427,010 Stock-based compensation expense403,983 363,774 311,020 Transaction costs21,839 22,769 55,935 Impairment charges— — 7,306 (Gain) loss on asset sales3,976 (10,845)(1,301)Adjusted EBITDA$3,369,700 $3,144,384 $2,852,898 Our adjusted EBITDA results have increased each year in total dollars due to the increase in our operating results, as discussed in ""Results of Operations"", as well as the nature of our business model consisting of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature, as also discussed in ""Overview"".63Table of ContentsFunds from Operations (""FFO"") and AFFOWe use FFO and AFFO, which are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in the REIT industry. FFO is calculated in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. FFO represents net income (loss), excluding gain (loss) from the disposition of real estate assets, depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures' and non-controlling interests' share of these items.In presenting AFFO, we exclude certain items that we believe are not good indicators of our current or future operating performance. AFFO represents FFO excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non-real estate assets, accretion, stock-based compensation, stock-based charitable contributions, restructuring charges, impairment charges, transaction costs, an installation revenue adjustment, a straight-line rent expense adjustment, a contract cost adjustment, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums, gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, an income tax expense adjustment, recurring capital expenditures, net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, and adjustments from FFO to AFFO for unconsolidated joint ventures' and noncontrolling interests' share of these items. The adjustments for installation revenue, straight-line rent expense and contract costs are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight-lined or amortized results in the consolidated statement of operations. We exclude the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings that have no current or future cash obligations. We exclude gain (loss) on debt extinguishment since it generally represents the write-off of initial costs incurred in connection with debt financings or a cost that is incurred to reduce future interest costs and is not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance. We include an income tax expense adjustment, which represents the non-cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions and deferred taxes that do not relate to current period's operations. We deduct recurring capital expenditures, which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of its IBX data centers or other assets that are required to support current revenues. We also exclude net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, which represents results that may not recur and are not a good indicator of our current future operating performance.64Table of ContentsOur FFO and AFFO were as follows (in thousands): Years Ended December 31,202220212020Net income$704,577 $499,728 $370,074 Net (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests(232)463 (297)Net income attributable to Equinix704,345 500,191 369,777 Adjustments:Real estate depreciation1,104,787 1,073,148 924,064 (Gain) loss on disposition of real estate property7,134 (6,439)4,063 Adjustments for FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures10,068 6,097 2,726 FFO attributable to common shareholders$1,826,334 $1,572,997 $1,300,630 Years Ended December 31,202220212020FFO attributable to common shareholders$1,826,334 $1,572,997 $1,300,630 Adjustments:Installation revenue adjustment17,745 27,928 (125)Straight-line rent expense adjustment16,263 9,677 10,787 Contract cost adjustment(52,888)(63,064)(35,675)Amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums17,826 17,135 15,739 Stock-based compensation expense403,983 363,774 311,020 Stock-based charitable contributions49,013 — — Non-real estate depreciation expense426,666 377,658 300,258 Amortization expense204,755 205,484 199,047 Accretion expense adjustment3,166 4,234 3,641 Recurring capital expenditures(188,885)(199,089)(160,637)(Gain) loss on debt extinguishment(327)115,125 145,804 Transaction costs21,839 22,769 55,935 Impairment charges(1)1,815 31,847 7,306 Income tax expense (benefit) adjustment(1)(31,165)(38,505)33,220 Adjustments for AFFO from unconsolidated joint ventures(2,262)3,259 2,195 AFFO attributable to common shareholders$2,713,878 $2,451,229 $2,189,145 (1)Impairment charges in 2022 and 2021 relate to the impairment of an indemnification asset resulting from the settlement of a pre-acquisition uncertain tax position, which was recorded as Other Income (Expense) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This impairment charge was offset by the recognition of tax benefits in the same amount, which was included within the Income tax expense (benefit) adjustment line on the table above. Our AFFO results have improved due to the improved operating results discussed earlier in ""Results of Operations,"" as well as due to the nature of our business model which consists of a recurring revenue stream and a cost structure which has a large base that is fixed in nature as discussed earlier in ""Overview.""65Table of ContentsConstant Currency PresentationOur revenues and certain operating expenses (cost of revenues, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses) from our international operations have represented and will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues and certain operating expenses. As a result, our revenues and certain operating expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. dollar against major international currencies. During the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, the U.S. dollar was stronger relative to the Australian dollar, British Pound, Euro, Japanese yen and Singapore dollar, which resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency impact on revenue, operating income and adjusted EBITDA, and a favorable foreign currency impact on operating expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, the U.S. dollar was weaker relative to the Brazilian real, which resulted in a favorable foreign currency impact on revenue, operating income and adjusted EBITDA, and an unfavorable foreign currency impact on operating expenses. In order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present period-over-period percentage changes in our revenues and certain operating expenses on a constant currency basis in addition to the historical amounts as reported. Our constant currency presentation excludes the impact of our foreign currency cash flow hedging activities. Presenting constant currency results of operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP results of operations. However, we have presented this non-GAAP financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate our results of operations. To present this information, our current period revenues and certain operating expenses from entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at constant exchange rates rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods (i.e. average rates in effect for the year ended December 31, 2021 are used as exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2022 when comparing the year ended December 31, 2022 with the year ended December 31, 2021). Liquidity and Capital ResourcesSources and Uses of CashCustomer collections are our primary source of cash. We believe we have a strong customer base, and have continued to experience relatively strong collections. As of December 31, 2022, our principle sources of liquidity were $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents. In addition to our cash balance, we had $3.9 billion of additional liquidity available to us from our $4.0 billion revolving facility and general access to both public and private debt and the equity capital markets. We also have additional liquidity available to us from our 2022 ATM program, under which we may offer and sell from time to time our common stock in ""at the market"" transactions on either a spot or forward basis. As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.4 billion available for sale under the 2022 ATM Program. We believe we have sufficient cash, coupled with anticipated cash generated from operating activities and external financing sources, to meet our operating requirements, including repayment of the current portion of our debt as it becomes due, distribution of dividends, completion of our publicly-announced acquisitions, ordinary costs to operate the business, and expansion projects.As we continue to grow, we may pursue additional expansion opportunities, primarily the build out of new IBX data centers, in certain of our existing markets which are at or near capacity within the next year, as well as potential acquisitions and joint ventures. If the opportunity to expand is greater than planned we may further increase the level of capital expenditure to support this growth as well as pursue additional business and real estate acquisitions or joint ventures provided that we have or can access sufficient funding to pursue such expansion opportunities. We may elect to access the equity or debt markets from time to time opportunistically, particularly if financing is available on attractive terms. We will continue to evaluate our operating requirements and financial resources in light of future developments.66Table of ContentsCash FlowYears Ended December 31,20222021Change(in thousands)Net cash provided by operating activities$2,963,182 $2,547,206 $415,976 Net cash used in investing activities(3,362,953)(3,006,738)(356,215)Net cash provided by financing activities856,766 413,765 443,001 Operating ActivitiesOur cash provided by our operations is generated by colocation, interconnection, managed infrastructure and other revenues. Our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include compensation and related costs, interest payments, other general corporate expenditures and taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $416.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021, primarily driven by improved results of operations partially offset by increases in cash paid for costs and operating expenses.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities increased by $356.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase of $805.5 million spent on the Entel Chile and Peru data center acquisitions and the MainOne acquisition, an increase of $46.4 million spent on real estate acquisitions and a $37.1 million increase in purchases of investments. This increase was partially offset by a $473.5 million decrease in capital expenditures, a $41.3 million increase in the proceeds from the sale of assets to our xScale Joint Ventures and an $18.0 million increase in proceeds from the sale of investments.Financing ActivitiesNet cash provided by financing activities increased by $443.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021, primarily driven by a $2.0 billion decrease in the repayment of senior notes, a $676.9 million increase in proceeds from term loan facilities, a $298.1 million increase in proceeds from the ATM program, a $129.1 million decrease in the repayment of mortgage and loans payable, a $99.2 million decrease in debt extinguishment costs, a $31.3 million decrease in repayments of finance lease liabilities, a $7.4 million decrease in debt issuance costs and a $3.9 million increase in proceeds from employee awards. This increase is partially offset by a $2.7 billion decrease in proceeds from senior notes and a $108.6 million increase in dividend distributions.Material Cash CommitmentsAs of December 31, 2022, our principle commitments were primarily comprised of:•approximately $12.2 billion of principal from our senior notes (gross of debt issuance cost and debt discount);•approximately $3.0 billion of interest on mortgage payable, loans payable, senior notes and term loans, based on their respective interest rates and recognized over the life of these instruments, and the credit facility fee for the revolving credit facility; •$653.6 million of principal from our term loans, mortgage and loans payable (gross of debt issuance cost, debt discount, plus mortgage premium); •approximately $5.4 billion of total lease payments, which represents lease payments under finance and operating lease arrangements, including renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised;•approximately $1.6 billion of unaccrued capital expenditure contractual commitments, primarily for IBX equipment not yet delivered and labor not yet provided in connection with the work necessary to complete construction and open IBX data center expansion projects prior to making them available to customers for installation, the majority of which is payable within the next 12 months; and•approximately $1.8 billion of other non-capital purchase commitments, such as commitments to purchase power in select locations and other open purchase orders, which contractually bind us for goods, services 67Table of Contentsor arrangements to be delivered or provided during 2023 and beyond, the majority of which is payable within the next two years.We believe that our sources of liquidity, including our expected future operating cash flows, are sized to adequately meet both the near and long term material cash commitments for the foreseeable future. For further information on maturities of lease liabilities and debt instruments, see Notes 10 and 11, respectively, within the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Contractual ObligationsWe have additional future equity contributions and commitments to the joint ventures with GIC and PGIM. For additional information, see the ""Equity Method Investments"" footnote within the Consolidated Financial Statements.Additionally, we entered into lease agreements with various landlords primarily for data center spaces and ground leases which have not yet commenced as of December 31, 2022. For additional information, see “Maturities of Lease Liabilities” in Note 10 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Management bases its assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from these assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes that the following accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial statements, and they require significant judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain:• Accounting for income taxes;• Accounting for business combinations;• Accounting for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; • Accounting for property, plant and equipment; and• Accounting for leases.68Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Income Taxes.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as tax attributes such as operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or settled. The accounting standard for income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined by the accounting standard as a likelihood of more than 50%) that such assets will not be realized.A tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based solely on its technical merits and consideration of the relevant taxing authority's widely understood administrative practices and precedents. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax benefit (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of those future tax consequences. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. If, based on the weight of that available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified.This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account a number of types of evidence, including the following: 1) the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses, 2) sources of future taxable income, 3) taxable income in carryback years permitted by the tax law, and 4) tax planning strategies.In assessing the tax benefit from an uncertain income tax position, the tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.For purposes of the quarterly REIT asset tests, we estimate the fair market value of assets within our QRSs and TRSs using a discounted cash flow approach, by calculating the present value of forecasted future cash flows. We apply discount rates based on industry benchmarks relative to the market and forecasting risks. Other significant assumptions used to estimate the fair market value of assets in QRSs and TRSs include projected revenue growth, projected operating margins and projected capital expenditure. We revisit significant assumptions periodically to reflect any changes due to business or economic environment.As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had net total deferred tax liabilities of $338.7 million and $280.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had a total valuation allowance of $166.6 million and $100.7 million, respectively. If and when we increase or reduce our valuation allowances, it may have an unfavorable or favorable impact, respectively, to our financial position and results of operations in the periods when such determinations are made. We will continue to assess the need for our valuation allowances, by jurisdiction, in the future.During the year ended December 31, 2022, we established full valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in the Americas and EMEA regions, either as the assessment of the realization of such deferred tax assets or as part of the purchase accounting determination for the businesses we acquired during the year. We do not expect these deferred tax assets to be realizable in the foreseeable future. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we established full valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions, as these deferred tax assets are not expected to be realizable in the foreseeable future.As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $89.2 million and $148.3 million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the unrecognized tax benefit decreased by $59.1 million primarily due to the settlements of tax audits in the EMEA region. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the unrecognized tax benefit decreased by $59.5 million primarily due to the settlements of various tax audits in the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. The unrecognized tax benefits of $89.2 million as of December 31, 2022, if subsequently recognized, will affect our effective tax rate favorably at the time when such a benefit is recognized.69Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Business CombinationsIn accordance with the accounting standard for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill. We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as customer contracts, leases and any other significant assets or liabilities and contingent consideration, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date if we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires assumptions and management's judgment to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Key judgments used to estimate the fair value of intangible assets include projected revenue growth and operating margins, discount rates, customer attrition rates, as well as the estimated useful life of intangible assets. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. During the last three years, we have completed a number of business combinations, including the acquisition of Entel Peru data centers in the third quarter of 2022, MainOne in West Africa and Entel Chile data centers, both in the second quarter of 2022, GPX in India in the third quarter of 2021, Bell data centers in Canada in the fourth quarter of 2020, Packet in March 2020 and Axtel in Mexico in January 2020. The purchase price allocation for these acquisitions has been finalized, except for the MainOne, Entel Peru and Entel Chile acquisitions.As of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had net intangible assets of $1.9 billion, respectively. We recorded amortization expense for intangible assets of $204.8 million, $205.5 million and $199.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we used to complete the purchase price allocations and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material, which would be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in 2022 or beyond. 70Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsIn accordance with the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets, we perform goodwill and other intangible assets impairment reviews annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We complete the annual goodwill impairment assessment for the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific reporting units to determine if the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values. We perform a review of other intangible assets for impairment by assessing events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. To perform annual goodwill impairment assessment, we elected to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. This analysis requires assumptions and estimates before performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test, where the assessment requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. Additionally, we periodically review our assessment of our reporting units to determine if changes in facts and circumstances warrant changes to our conclusions. There were no specific factors present in 2022 or 2021 that indicated a potential goodwill impairment. We performed our annual review of other intangible assets by assessing if there were events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, such as a significant decrease in market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset or a continuous deterioration of our financial condition. This assessment requires assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our actual and forecasted operating results, approved business plans, future economic conditions and other market data. There were no specific events in 2022 or 2021 that indicated a potential impairment.As of December 31, 2022, goodwill attributable to the Americas, the EMEA and the Asia-Pacific reporting units was $2.6 billion, $2.4 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively.Future events, changing market conditions and any changes in key assumptions may result in an impairment charge. While we have not recorded an impairment charge against our goodwill to date, the development of adverse business conditions in our Americas, EMEA or Asia-Pacific reporting units, such as higher than anticipated customer churn or significantly increased operating costs, or significant deterioration of our market comparables that we use in the market approach, could result in an impairment charge in future periods.The balance of our other intangible assets, net, for both years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $1.9 billion. While we have not recorded an impairment charge against our other intangible assets to date, future events or changes in circumstances, such as a significant decrease in market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate, may result in an impairment charge in future periods. 71Table of ContentsDescriptionJudgments and UncertaintiesEffect if Actual Results Differ from AssumptionsAccounting for Property, Plant and EquipmentWe have a substantial amount of property, plant and equipment recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The vast majority of our property, plant and equipment represent the costs incurred to build out or acquire our IBX data centers. Our IBX data centers are long-lived assets. We depreciate our property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets (subject to the term of the lease in the case of leased assets or leasehold improvements and integral equipment located in leased properties). Accounting for property, plant and equipment includes determining the appropriate period in which to depreciate such assets, assessing such assets for potential impairment, capitalizing interest during periods of construction and assessing the asset retirement obligations required for certain leased properties that require us to return the leased properties back to their original condition at the time we decide to exit a leased property.Judgments are required in arriving at the estimated useful life of an asset and changes to these estimates would have significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. When we lease a property for our IBX data centers, we generally enter into long-term arrangements with renewal options generally available to us. In the next several years, a number of leases for our IBX data centers will come up for renewal. As we start approaching the end of these initial lease terms, we will need to reassess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment. In addition, we may find that our estimates for the useful lives of non-leased assets may also need to be revised periodically. We periodically review the estimated useful lives of certain of our property, plant and equipment and changes in these estimates in the future are possible. The assessment of long-lived assets for impairment requires assumptions and estimates of undiscounted and discounted future cash flows. These assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and are inherently uncertain.As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had property, plant and equipment of $16.6 billion and $15.4 billion, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded depreciation expense of $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.2 billion, respectively. While we evaluated the appropriateness, we did not revise the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Further changes in our estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment could have a significant impact on our results of operations.Accounting for LeasesA significant portion of our data center spaces, office spaces and equipment are leased. Each time we enter into a new lease or lease amendments, we analyze each lease or lease amendment for the proper accounting, including determining if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception and making assessment of the leased properties to determine if they are operating or finance leases. Determination of accounting treatment, including the result of the lease classification test for each new lease or lease amendment, is dependent on a variety of judgments, such as identification of lease and non-lease components, allocation of total consideration between lease and non-lease components, determination of lease term, including assessing the likelihood of lease renewals, valuation of leased property, and establishing the incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payment for the lease test. The judgments used in the accounting for leases are inherently subjective; different assumptions or estimates could result in different accounting treatment for a lease.Lease assumptions and estimates are determined and applied at the inception of the leases or at the lease modification date. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, operating right-of-use (""ROU"") lease assets were at $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, and operating lease liabilities were at $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, finance ROU assets were $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, and finance lease liabilities were $2.3 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded the finance lease cost of $273.6 million, $275.0 million and $233.9 million , respectively, and recorded rent expense of approximately $213.6 million, $221.8 million and $217.3 million, respectively.Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee ""Recent Accounting Pronouncements"" in Note 1 within the Consolidated Financial Statements.72Table of ContentsITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket Risk The following discussion about market risk involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, primarily electricity.We employ foreign currency forward and option contracts, cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate locks for the purpose of hedging certain specifically identified exposures. The use of these financial instruments is intended to mitigate some of the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates, but does not eliminate such risks. We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.Investment Portfolio RiskWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities that is prioritized on meeting REIT asset requirements. All of our marketable securities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair values recognized in net income. We consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge for our securities, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. We anticipate that we will recover the entire cost basis of these securities and have determined that no other-than-temporary impairments associated with credit losses were required to be recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022.As of December 31, 2022, our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market funds. The amount in our investment portfolio that could be susceptible to market risk totaled $764.6 million.Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our outstanding debt. An immediate increase or decrease in current interest rates from their position as of December 31, 2022 would not have a material impact on our interest expense due to the fixed coupon rate on the majority of our debt obligations. However, the interest expense associated with our senior credit facility and term loans that bear interest at variable rates could be affected. For every 100-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, our annual interest expense could increase by approximately $6.1 million or decrease by approximately $6.1 million based on the total balance of our term loan borrowings as of December 31, 2022.We periodically enter into interest rate locks to hedge the interest rate exposure created by anticipated fixed rate debt issuances, which are designated as cash flow hedges. When interest rate locks are settled, any accumulated gain or loss included as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the forecasted hedged transaction which is equivalent to the term of the interest rate locks. We also use cross-currency swaps to hedge our interest rate risk in our variable rate debt obligations by changing the benchmark rate for a portion of the variable rate debt obligations from SONIA to SOFR. As of December 31, 2022, the total notional amount of such cross-currency interest rate swaps was $280.3 million.The fair value of our long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. These interest rate changes may affect the fair value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows. The fair value of our mortgage and loans payable, which are not traded in the market, is estimated by considering our credit rating, current rates available to us for debt of the same remaining maturities and the terms of the debt. The fair value of our other senior notes, which are traded in the market, was based on quoted market prices. The following table represents the carrying value and estimated fair value of our mortgage and loans payable and senior notes as of (in thousands):73Table of ContentsDecember 31, 2022December 31, 2021Carrying Value (1)Fair ValueCarrying Value (1)Fair ValueMortgage and loans payable$653,617 $666,387 $618,388 $621,051 Senior notes12,226,890 10,196,933 11,102,130 11,049,834 (1)The carrying value is gross of debt issuance cost, debt discount and debt premium.Foreign Currency Risk To help manage the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we have implemented a number of hedging programs, in particular (i) a cash flow hedging program to hedge the forecasted revenues and expenses in our EMEA region as well as our debt denominated in foreign-currencies, (ii) a balance sheet hedging program to hedge the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, and (iii) a net investment hedging program to hedge the long term investments in our foreign subsidiaries. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements and their impact on the consolidated statements of operations.We have entered into various foreign currency debt obligations. As of December 31, 2022, the total principal amount of foreign currency debt obligations was $1.8 billion, including $1.2 billion denominated in Euro and $603.9 million denominated in British Pound. As of December 31, 2022, we have designated $1.5 billion of the total principal amount of foreign currency debt obligations as net investment hedges against our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. For a net investment hedge, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument designated as a net investment hedge are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the U.S. Dollar will impact the amount of U.S. Dollars that we will require to settle the foreign currency debt obligations at maturity. If the U.S. Dollar would have been weaker or stronger by 10% in comparison to these foreign currencies as of December 31, 2022, we estimate our obligation to cash settle the principal of these foreign currency debt obligations in U.S. Dollars would have increased or decreased by approximately $197.9 million and $161.9 million, respectively. We are also party to cross-currency interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total notional amounts of cross-currency interest rate swap contracts, which have been designated as hedges of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, were $3.9 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. The changes in the fair value of these swaps are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets. If the U.S. Dollar weakened or strengthened by 10% in comparison to foreign currencies, we estimate our obligation to cash settle these hedges would have increased or decreased by approximately $375.6 million and $307.3 million, respectively.The U.S. Dollar strengthened relative to certain of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate during the year ended December 31, 2022. This has impacted our consolidated financial position and results of operations during this period, including the amount of revenues that we reported. Continued strengthening or weakening of the U.S. Dollar will continue to impact us in future periods. With the existing cash flow hedges in place, a hypothetical additional 10% strengthening of the U.S. Dollar during the year ended December 31, 2022 would have resulted in a reduction of our revenues and a reduction of our operating expenses including depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $222.1 million and $220.8 million, respectively.With the existing cash flow hedges in place, a hypothetical additional 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar during the year ended December 31, 2022 would have resulted in an increase of our revenues and an increase of our operating expenses including depreciation and amortization expenses, by approximately $284.3 million and $283.7 million, respectively.74Table of ContentsCommodity Price RiskCertain operating costs incurred by us are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices. The commodities most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of price changes are electricity, supplies and equipment used in our IBX data centers. We closely monitor the cost of electricity at all of our locations. We have entered into various power contracts to purchase power at fixed prices in certain locations in Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the U.S.In addition, as we are building new, or expanding existing, IBX data centers, we are subject to commodity price risk for building materials related to the construction of these IBX data centers, such as steel and copper. In addition, the lead-time to procure certain pieces of equipment, such as generators, is substantial. Any delays in procuring the necessary pieces of equipment for the construction of our IBX data centers could delay the anticipated openings of these new IBX data centers and, as a result, increase the cost of these projects.We do not currently employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to address commodity price risk other than the power contracts discussed above.",2023-12-30 20:28:05.423774
